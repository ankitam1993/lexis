preface gao assists congressional-decisionmakers in their deliberative-process by furnishing analytical-information on issues and options under consideration . many diverse-methodologies are needed to develop sound and timely-answers to the questions that are posed by the congress . to provide gao evaluators with basic-information about the more commonly used methodologies , gao 's policy-guidance includes documents such as methodology-transfer-papers and technical-guidelines . this methodology-transfer-paper on case-study-evaluations describes how gao evaluators could use case-study-methods in performing our work . it describes six applications of case-study-methods , including the purposes and pitfalls of each , and explains similarities and differences among the six . this paper presents an evaluation-perspective on case-studies , defines them , and determines their appropriateness in terms of the type of evaluation-question posed . the original-report was authored by lois-ellin datta in april 1987 . this reissued ( 1990 ) version supersedes the earlier edition . case-study-evaluations is one of a series of papers issued by the program-evaluation and methodology division ( pemd ) . the purpose of the series is to provide gao evaluators with guides to various-aspects of audit and evaluation-methodology , to illustrate applications , and to indicate where more detailed-information is available . we look forward to receiving-comments from the readers of this paper . they should be addressed to eleanor chelimsky at 202-275-1854 . werner grosshans assistant comptroller general office of policy eleanor chelimsky assistant comptroller general for program-evaluation and methodology contents preface chapter 4 63 data-collection 63 data-collection data-analysis 67 and analysis handling multisite-data-sets 70 basic-models for data-analysis 73 pitfalls and booby traps 74 where to go for more information 78 chapter 579 what are case-studies ? 79 summary when are case-studies appropriately used 79in-evaluation ? what distinguishes a good from a 80not-good case-study ? impartiality and generalizability 84 appendixes appendix i : theory and history 86 appendix ii : site-selection example 106 appendix iii : guidelines for reviewing-case-113study reports bibliography 121 glossary 145 papers in this series 150 tables table 2.1 : what is a case-study ? exercise . 13 table 2.2 : complexity of questions 18 table 2.3 : methods of obtaining description 20 and analysis in case-studies table 2.4 : some common-benefits expected 24 from case-study-evaluations table 2.5 : instance-selection in case-studies 27 table 2.6 : hypothetical-data on instance 30selection table 3.1 : illustrative-case-studies 38 table 3.2 : exploratory-case-studies 42 table 3.3 : critical-instance-case studies 48 table 3.4 : program-implementation case 51studies table 3.5 : illustration of differences in 53note-taking table 3.6 : program-effects-case studies 56 table 3.7 : cumulative-case-studies 59 table 3.8 : some design-decisions in case 61study methods table 4.1 : ways of analyzing case-study 69data table 5.1 : some common-pitfalls in case 81study evaluation table i.1 : criteria of good-research 88 table i.2 : evaluation-adaptations of the 103research case-study table ii.i : hypothetical-data on unfiled 107 corporate-income tax returns for 1986 state income tax returns table iii.1 : checklist for reviewing-case-study reports abbreviations chapter 1 introduction at his government-required anti-terrorist training session recently , a captain for a major-airline said , '' the bits of information were so few and far between that people were n't even paying-attention . my instructor for the eight-hour course entered the room only to change videotapes . people were talking ; they were doing other things , including reading the paper . '' ( philadelphia inquirer , 1986 ) this is a case-instance . it is an effective way of drawing attention to a problem such as training-quality . such anecdotes are remembered and they are convincing . what they are not , however , is generalizable : that is , an anecdote does n't tell whether it is the only such instance or whether the problem is wide-spread . and anecdotes usually do n't show the reasons for a situation , and thus are of limited-value in suggesting-solutions . the challenge for evaluators is how to use those aspects of an anecdote that are effective for our work-the-immediacy , the convincingness , the attention-getting-quality-and , at the same time , fulfill other informational-requirements for our jobs , such as generalizability and reliability . case-study-methods , while not without their limitations in this regard , can help us answer this challenge . gao already does a lot of case studies-or at least , what we ourselves call case-studies in describing our methods . there are gao case-studies in many areas-urban-housing , weapon-systems testing , community-development , military-procurement-contracts , influences on the brazilian-export-import-balances , how programs aimed at improving-water-quality are working , and the implementation of block-grants-to-name only a few . most of these case-studies are either `` illustrative '' or '' critical '' instance-applications . the first type of page 8 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations application illustrates findings established by other techniques , supplementing , for example , national-findings on clean-air from administrative-records and other sources , with in-depth description on how funds have been used and with what results in selected cities . the second type of application is in-depth analysis of a case of unique-interest , such as whether funds have been awarded and managed properly in a specific-community-health center or if a certain former-government-official had done anything improper before or after leaving the government . there are , however , four other applications of case-studies that are less often used at present but that could be appropriate for our jobs . in brief , the six types of case-study , which we examine in chapter 3 , are as follows : 1 . illustrative . this case-study is descriptive in character and intended to add realism and in-depth-examples to other information about a program or policy . 2 . exploratory . this is also a descriptive-case-study but is aimed at generating-hypotheses for later-investigation rather than illustrating . 3 . critical-instance . this examines a single-instance of unique-interest or serves as a critical-test of an assertion about a program , problem , or strategy . 4 . program-implementation . this case-study-investigates operations , often at several-sites , and often normatively . 5 . program-effects . this application uses the case-study to examine causality and usually involves multisite , multimethod assessments . page 9 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations 6 . cumulative . this brings together-findings from many case-studies to answer an evaluation-question , whether descriptive , normative , or cause-and-effect . case-study-evaluations is a review of methodological-issues involved in using case-study-evaluations . it is not a detailed guide to case-study-design . it does , however , explain the similarities and differences among the six kinds of case-study and discusses ideas for successfully designing them . it also gives guidance to the manager who , in reviewing completed case-studies , wants to assess their strengths . finally , it presents an evaluation-perspective on case-studies , defining them and determining their appropriateness in terms of the type of evaluation-question posed . the methods and types of case-studies outlined here are not definitive . the case-study as a research-method has evolved over many years of experience but evaluative-use of the method has been more limited . indeed , the history of the case-study as an evaluation-method is little older than a decade . therefore , discussion of some of the applications described here is based on relatively extensive-field-experience ( with questions in such domains as justice , education , welfare , environment , housing , and foreign-aid ) , while the discussion of some of the other applications is based on more constrained experience . we have paid particular-attention to the conventional-wisdom that case-studies are always-subjective and nongeneralizable . in many uses of case-studies , there is no need to generalize . nonetheless , we find that there are steps that can be taken to generalize from case-studies when this is desired . however , we did not devote any particular-emphasis to the popular-idea that case-studies are inexpensive to conduct ( issues of research-management common to all page 10 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations designs were outside the scope of our work ) . however , one thing that should emerge quite clearly from the discussion of design-features intrinsic to the case-study is that it can be a rather costly-endeavor , given the time required , the rich in-depth-nature of the information sought , and the need to achieve credibility . this reinforces the importance of weighing carefully the decisions to employ the case-study-method in program-evaluation . in this paper , we have taken positions on many issues , expecting to revise these as experience accumulates and as we receive reactions from evaluators and researchers . this paper is intended to transfer what we believe to be good-practice in case-studies and to help establish the principles of applying-case-studies to evaluation . thus , while the document offers preliminary-guidance , it is also a point of departure . for example , we are developing the variation that we call the `` cumulative '' case-study . it can entail prospective and retrospective-designs and it permits synthesis of many individual-case-studies undertaken at different-times and in different-sites . the quality of case-studies can be variable . some score high on reasonable-tests of quality ; others have lower scores . three problems often encountered have to do with matching the question the evaluator set out to answer and the method for selecting the instances examined , reporting the basis for selecting the instances , and integrating-findings across several-instances when the findings in one were inconsistent with those in another . the next-sections of this paper will first present some new ways of thinking about a familiar-method , the case-study , and then introduce the six applications , describing what is required , in terms of methodology , to get the benefits-case-studies can offer . in the last-page 11 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations chapter , we turn to two basic-questions : what do we need to take into account with regard to the objectivity of case-studies and their generalizability ? chapter 2 what are case-studies ? almost-everyone in gao probably has worked on a case-study at one time or another yet may be unfamiliar with what is meant , methodologically , by a case-study . the methodological-meaning is important in understanding what differentiates a case-study from a noncase-study and a good-case-study from a not-so-good-case study . what is a case-study ? the exercise in table 2.1 describes a job we might be asked to do and a design for it and asks you to decide whether or not this is a case-study . take about 10 minutes to think through this example and write out your answer . it is important that you try this out yourself , so please do it before continuing . the answers some gao evaluators gave may illustrate the range of definitions surrounding case-study-methods . to some gao evaluators , the instance was an application of the case-study-method , because we were looking at only a few sites or because we could not generalize or because `` actual-subjects are being used for analysis of a specific-question . '' to some , the instance was clearly not an application of the case-study-method , because `` we do not know if the instances are representative of the universe , '' and `` there does n't appear to be enough done at each site . '' to still others , it was not possible to tell whether this was a case-study because looking at instances was what we do in all our methods , and there was no differentiation between this job and a compliance-audit . the definitions given also varied greatly . to one person , a case-study involves looking at individual-people . to another , a case-study examines a clearly defined site and reports on that one site , so that multiple-site-studies would not be case-studies . to another , case-studies involve getting a great deal of information about a single-site or circumstance , when generalizability isn't important . to others , `` a random-sample is necessary for a case-study , '' `` case-studies are nonnormative-research that investigate a situation without prejudice , '' `` where we could look at a limited-number of cases that would represent the universe overall , '' and `` a review of relevant-conditions in a specific-environment with no attempt to project to a larger universe . '' there were almost as many definitions as people , and few of them had elements in common . while exact-uniformity is n't expected or perhaps even possible when people are asked to recall a definition , the extreme-variability illustrates that we could be talking about very different-things in page 14 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations what is meant by `` a case-study '' ? a proposal or report when we discuss case-study-methods . thus a decision to `` do case-studies '' could lead to the collection of irreconcilably dissimilar-information from groups working on the same job . we have developed a definition of case-studies that leads to appropriate-uses and says something about how a good-case-study is conducted . it is somewhat-technical , so we turn next to giving this definition and to discussing each of its elements . `` a case-study is a method for learning about a complex-instance , based on a comprehensive-understanding of that instance obtained by extensive-description and analysis of that instance taken as a whole and in its context . '' for example , if we were asked to study what caused the three mile island disaster and scoped the job to describe whether required-safeguards were complied with , this would not be a case-study . if , however , we scoped the job to examine in depth-events leading up to the disaster , what went wrong , and why it went wrong , this would be a case-study . for a second example , if we were asked to study the safety of nuclear-plants in general , we might select as our method a survey of self-reported compliance with safeguards in all existing-plants . this would not be a case-study . if , however , we scoped the job to examine in depth recent-problems in appropriately selected nuclear-plants including among others three mile island , seeking to understand why the safeguards either were not complied with or were not sufficient , then we would have selected the case-study-method to answer the question . as we will discuss later , several-methods can be used in one job ; these examples are only intended to highlight what is not , and what is , a case-study . page 15 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations examining the elements of the definition also may help make this distinction clear . `` a complex-instance '' means that input and output can not be readily or very accurately related . there are several-reasons why such a relationship might be difficult . there could be many influences on what is happening and these influences could interact in nonlinear-ways such that a unit of change in the input can be associated with quite-different changes in the output , sometimes increasing it , sometimes decreasing it , and sometimes having no discernible-effect . table 2.2 gives an example of a less and a more complex-instance . `` are u.s. airports following required u.s. and international-security-procedures for passengers ? '' is a less complex-question because the criterion is fairly-clear , the focus is narrow , the influences on compliance are likely to be relatively few , and the relation of input and output is likely to be fairly-direct . staff-knowledge of procedures ought to play some role in following these procedures , for instance . some questions are more complex , however , such as the question : '' are security-procedures in u.s. airports sufficient to protect the safety of passengers and equipment ? '' this is more complex because the criterion of `` sufficient-protection '' is much less certain ; the focus is broader ; the influences on actual-achievement of sufficient-procedures are likely to be many ; and the relation of input and output is not only likely to be both direct and indirect but also difficult to measure . the second key-element in our definition is `` a comprehensive-understanding . '' here the situation is more straightforward . this means that the goal of a page 16 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations case-study is to obtain as complete a picture as possible of what is going on in an instance , and why . the third key-element , `` obtained by extensive-description and analysis , '' has three components . these are summarized in table 2.3 . case-studies involve what methodologists call `` thick '' descriptions : rich , full-information that should come from multiple-data-sources , particularly from firsthand-observations . the analysis also is extensive , and the method compares information from different types of data-sources through a technique called `` triangulation . '' that is , reliability of the findings is developed through the multiple-data-sources within each type . this is akin to corroboration as discussed in the general policy manual , chapter 8.0 . the validity of the findings , particularly-validity with regard to table 2.2 : complexity of questions-example-characteristic a less complex-question are u.s. airports following required u.s. and international-security-procedures for passengers ? criterion is fairly-clear : `` required u.s. and international-security-procedures '' focus is narrow : `` passengers '' influences on compliance are likely to be relatively few : staff-knowledge of procedures , staff-training in their implementation , functioning-equipment , number of staff compared to workflow , degree of supervision , staff-screening and selection relation of input ( influences on compliance ) to output ( that required security-procedures are followed ) is fairly-direct ( continued ) example-characteristic a more complex-question are security-procedures in u.s. airports sufficient-toprotect the safety of passengers and equipment ? criterion is less clear : what would be sufficient under present conditions and with existing and possible-technologies ? focus is broader : passengers and equipment ( although still fairly well specified ) influences on achievement of sufficient-procedures likely to be many , including the state of the art of detection-technologies , number and militancy of potential-threats to security , and the willingness of passengers , airline-personnel , and airport-personnel to accept different-costs and forms of protection relation of input ( influences on security ) and output ( safety ) likely to be difficult to measure and to be both indirect and direct table 2.3 : methods of obtaining description technique methodology and analysis in case extensive or `` thick '' analysisstudiesa analysis of multiple-types of data-sources such as -interviews with all relevant persons -observations over time -participant observation -documents -archives -physical information adifferent-types of evidence and standards for them are discussed in general policy manual , chapter 8.0. cause and effect , is derived from agreement among the types of data-sources , together with the systematic ruling out of alternative-explanations and the explanation of `` outlier '' results . examining-consistency of evidence across different types of data-sources is akin to verification . there are specialized strategies for making these comparisons-namely , pattern-matching , explanation-building , and thematic-review . the technical-how-tos for these three strategies will be summarized later in this paper . they involve techniques such as graphic-data-displays , tabulations of event-frequencies , and chronological or time-series-orderings . generally , data-collection and analysis are concurrent and interactive-that is , `` yoked '' in case-study-methods . the next-element of the definition is `` taken as a whole . '' as this list indicates , the size of the instance can be as small as one individual or as large as a nation . the instance as a whole can be • an individual ( ferdinand marcos ) . • a site ( three mile island ) . • a function ( joint-test and evaluation program1 ) . • an office ( program-evaluation-groups in departments ) . • a department or agency ( irs , census ) . • an event ( cuban missile-crisis1 ; challenger tragedy ) . • a region , nation , or organization ( chesapeake bay water-cleanup efforts , democracy in philippines , unesco ) . • '' nested '' units in a large or complex-case-study ( note that the instance or unit must be specified and data appropriate to it collected ) . one example of a gao case-study that examines an individual is our examination of whether or not a 1these-instances have been the subject of case-studies . ( see u.s. general-accounting-office , february 22 , 1984 , and allison , 1971 . ) others are general-illustrations . page 21 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations senior-official behaved improperly with regard to influence and accepting-money before and since leaving the white house ( u.s. general-accounting-office , july 11 , 1986 ) . another example would be a request to examine in detail-ex-president-marcos ' use of funds intended by the united states for military or civilian-purposes for his personal-benefit . at the other extreme , an instance may be as large as an event , such as the cuban-missile-crisis ( allison , 1971 ) and the swine-flu-vaccine ( neustadt and fineberg , 1978 ) , which have been the subjects of two well-known-case-studies , or the challenger tragedy . it can be a region ( chesapeake bay water-cleanup programs ) , a nation ( democracy in the philippines ) , or an organization ( unesco ) . moreover , it is possible to have questions that require nested-case-studies . for example , to answer a question about how programs to serve handicapped-children are working , we might select the cases of preschool and elementary-programs ; we might further select within preschool-programs , those for the hearing impaired and those for the orthopedically impaired . each of these nested-studies is treated , in terms of specification of the unit of study and collection of data appropriate to it , as any other case-study would be . the last key-element of the definition is `` and in its context . '' context means all factors that could affect what is happening in an instance . as an example , in the challenger tragedy , inquiry began with trying to locate the technology that failed as the reason for the explosion . the righthand-booster-rocket was identified as the source of the explosion and , within the rocket , technological attention focused on the o-rings . the inquiry expanded very quickly , however , from asking what technology failed to an examination of contextual-influences , such as page 22 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations • decisionmaking on whether or not to go , in relation to the o-rings ; • decisionmaking on whether or not to go , in relation to other components , such as tiles ; • decisionmaking more generally in nasa with regard to nasa-contractor-astronaut-relations and responsibilities ; • influences on nasa , such as alleged-pressures not to cancel flights ; • quality-control-tradeoffs in nasa generally and nasa management . that is , the challenger inquiry could be seen as similar to a case-study in some ways . the rapid-spread of inquiry from an examination of the technology to an investigation of decisionmaking on that flight , to inquiry about nasa management as it affected the challenger disaster generally , is what `` taking the context into account '' means . in case-study-methods , to understand what happened and why , context always is considered , and it is this consideration that gives the case-study its strength as a way of understanding cause and effect . some common-benefits expected from case-study-evaluations doing a good-case-study is more than just looking at what is happening in a few instances . it is a special systematic way of looking at what is happening , of selecting the instances , collecting the data , analyzing the information , and reporting the results . there are nine features of case-study-evaluations that merit special-discussion . each of these features-if carried-out-confers certain-benefits in terms of the product . two of the features relate to design , three to data-collection , three to analysis , and one to reporting . these features and their benefits are shown in table 2.4 . for example , with regard to design , information over time-the longitudinal-feature of the page 23 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations design-provides-assurance that the final-product represents what is happening and is not registering an atypical-situation . table 2.4 : some common-benefits expected from case-study-evaluations study feature-benefits expected design longitudinal-assurance that a short-term-situation that may be unrepresentative of what is happening is n't inflated in importance triangulation-assurance that reasons given for events properly reflect influences from many different-sources purposive-instance-ability to match questions asked and later generalization of findings at level appropriate to the questions data-collection comprehensive-assurance that important-conditions , consequences , and reasons for these have not been overlooked flexible broader perspectives , increased-assurance that what is important on the scene rather than centrally will be examined multiple-data-sources assurance that a full-picture will be obtained and that bias associated with self-protection or self-interests will be reduced analysis '' yoked '' or concurrent with data-assurance of the ability to collect data-collections needed to test alternative-interpretations and to make rapid-adjustments in design search for disproving-proving-evidence-assurance that alternative-interpretations have been thoroughly searched for and checked ; thorough-identification of instances that do n't fit the general-pattern ; and , often , understanding of the reasons for the outliers study feature-benefits expected chain-of-evidence and pattern-matching permit fairly-direct assessment of how techniques convincingly the evidence of conclusions are related reporting actual-instances persuasiveness-assurance of authenticity through and ease of recall ; use of the tendency to generalize from personal-experience but via the substitution of more objective experience for anecdotes of unknown-credibility instance-selection in case-studies these features are the price of admission to the expected-benefits . one frequent-question about case-study-methods is how rigorously these features have to be followed . obviously , the more closely the requirements are followed , the more benefits can be expected . it is a judgment-call as to how much the features can be compromised before the `` case-study '' becomes a site-visit or turns into a survey . probably the most critical-features are appropriate-instance-selection , triangulation , and the search for disproving evidence . and of these three , probably the most critical is appropriate-instance-selection . there are three general-bases for selecting-instances : convenience , purpose , and probability . each has its function and can be used to answer certain-questions . a good-case-study will use a basis for instance-selection that is appropriate for the question to be answered . using the wrong-basis for selecting an instance is a fatal-error in case-study-designs , as in all designs . such a case-study is a not-good-case-study , and it is irredeemably-flawed despite any methodological-virtues it may have in terms of data-collection , analysis , and reporting . table 2.5 summarizes the three general-bases for selecting-instances and the questions each basis can answer . of particular-interest may be the seven varieties of purposive-site-selection : bracketing , best cases , worst cases , cluster , representative , typical , and special-interest . instance-selection is crucial to generalizability and to answering the evaluation-questions appropriately . only rarely will convenience be a sound-basis for instance-selection ; only rarely will probability-sampling be feasible . thus , instance-selection on the basis-of-the purpose of the study is the most appropriate-method in many designs . representative `` in instances chosen to represent important variations , what is the program like and why ? '' typical `` in a typical-site , what is happening and why ? '' special-interest `` in this particular-circumstance , what is happening and why ? '' probability `` what is happening in the program as a whole , and why ? '' the match between the question asked and the method of purposive sampling chosen can be tricky . for example , studies that attain '' representativeness '' by conducting a few case-studies in a rural-setting , a few in a suburban-setting , and a few in an urban-setting will produce a report in which the three settings receive more or less equal-weight . if , however , 90 percent of the clients or sites for the program are rural , such `` representativeness '' may appropriately capture the range of site-experiences page 27 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations but be rather-unrepresentative of the program as a whole , and care will be needed to generalize only to the range of settings and not to the program as a whole . acosts per person per day , charged by contractor to funder ( hypothetical-data ) . bproblem-rates include all problems considered under contract as serious , such as escape , acts of violence by or toward individuals , vandalism requiring more than $ 1,000 to repair , and suicides . rates are number of such instances per 100 days per year ( hypothetical-data ) . to illustrate what each variety means , and how it might be operationalized , consider the information in table 2.6 . this gives hypothetical-data about a real-situation in designing a study-selecting-instances ( in page 31 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations this study , sites or locations ) for an assessment of the costs and operations of federal-detention-facilities managed by private contractors under omb circular a-76 . there are not many such facilities-so the 16 hypothetical-facilities represent what we might actually find in such a study . the following-paragraphs describe what a sample would look like if it were chosen according to the bases in table 2.6 . convenience if our location were the denver regional-office , a convenience-sample would be sites 8 ( denver ) and 9 samples ( salida ) . that is , ease of collecting-data and minimizing resources required would have driven our choice . were looking at something about colorado rather than about low-problem-centers . we could do this by selecting 1 ( san diego , 4 percent ) , 2 ( amarillo , 4 percent ) , and 13 ( san francisco , 14 percent ) . worst cases sites 5 ( miami , 15-percent-problems ) and 6 ( clearwater , 10 percent ) stand out as worst cases . selecting an out-of-state-comparison , if we wanted it , is harder here . the next highest problem-rate ( 9 , salida , at 9 percent ) is run by a different-company and costs much less . security has a site in san francisco , for men and boys , which costs $ 70 daily with a 7-percent problem-rate . the costs of site 15 ( washington , d.c. ) are higher , but this site serves families and has a low-problem-rate . the best choice probably is 12 ( san francisco ) : it serves the same group ( men and boys ) and is run by the same company ( security ) . cluster we might be interested in administrative arrangements-in , for example , how administration works out when ins alone is the contractor , when responsibility is shared with another federal-agency ( bureau of prisons ) , and when responsibility is shared with the state . one cluster of sites ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , and 15 ) is administered by ins alone . another cluster ( 4 , 5 , and 6 ) is shared between bop and ins , and the last-cluster ( 7 , 8 , 12 , and 16 ) is run by ins and the state . we could pick one or two sites from each cluster to get a sense of how agency-auspices may affect program-operations . representative one issue we might need to examine could be efficiencies of operation-particularly in terms of facility-size . here we might select numbers 1 ( san diego , 800 beds ) , 6 ( clearwater , 300 beds ) , and 10 ( salinas , 100 beds ) . all are run by caim , and all serve men and boys . we would have to limit our generalizations to facilities for men and boys , but page 33 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations these three sites should give a good-sense of the size and operations-issue . typical this would be a challenge . in terms of size , there is a '' typical '' bed-size ( 100 beds ) ; in terms of people served , there is a `` typical '' population ( men and boys ) ; and in terms of years of operation , 3 years is `` typical , '' with 2 years a close-runner-up . in terms of costs , however , the distribution is trimodal-that is , three values appear about equally-often-and for percent of problems , it is almost-flat with two outliers . also , there is not a single-site that matches all three `` typical '' characteristics well . miami , for example , has 100 beds and serves men and boys , but it has been in operation only 1 year , costs $ 150 per person per day , and has a 15-percent problem-rate . the best approach would be to indicate that it is not possible to pick one site that is `` typical '' of such distributions . special-interest any one of the 16 sites might be examined as a result of special congressional-interest . such interest usually would be based on information-extraneous to the data in the table : a complaint might be received , for example , about conditions in the san diego site , or allegations might be made that the high costs of the miami site were due to mismanagement . probability-samples probabilistic-sampling is the method of choice for answering-questions about `` how much , '' or how extensive a problem is in a population . properly carried out , it provides strong-generalizability and assurance of representativeness . a probability-sample is one in which all members of the population have a known and equal-chance of being selected . if we used a table of random-numbers , and selected as the first two sites those corresponding to the first two numbers between 1 and 16 in the table , we would have selected a probability-sample . each site would page 34 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations have a 1-in-16 chance of selection , and that chance would be equal among sites . a fair-objection to this statement is that the laws of probability operate on large numbers , and selecting fewer than 30 instances does not always provide the generalizability to the population as a whole that probability-samples promise . however , in terms of actual-operations , which we want to illustrate here , the method just sketched is a probabilistic one , and some case-studies have involved 30 or more sites selected on a probabilistic-basis . ( see pemd 's transfer-paper entitled using statistical-sampling ( u.s. general-accounting-office , may 15 , 1986 ) for more information . ) for readers who want to check out their skills in applying different types of purposive-selection , appendix ii gives information for a job involving the 50 states ( a fairly-common situation for gao ) , a form for indicating which you would select for each of the seven kinds of purposive-selection , and our answers , for comparison against yours . in many jobs , what is a `` case '' and what dimensions are important to consider in selection will be clear . for example , the population of detention-facilities supported by ins contracts can be defined legally ( by the contract awarded ) , and the relevant-dimensions ( length of time in operation , facility-size , detainee-mix ) are straightforward . there are , however , more problematic circumstances . an example would be a study of the extent to which voluntary-organizations have taken up any slack in welfare supports . what is a voluntary-organization can be defined broadly , as `` any nonprofit-organization , '' or narrowly , as `` a service-oriented-group whose members do not receive payment for their work . '' dimensions of potential-relevance for the outcome of interest are many , and the empirical-basis for selecting any one dimension over others few . in such situations , the evaluator can turn to past-experience , a search of the appropriate theoretical as well as empirical-literature , the advice of knowledgeable-persons , an examination of key-issues in proposed or pending-legislation , customer-guidance , and similar-techniques . that is , while it is important to recognize the difficulties , there are ways of dealing with them in case-definition . chapter 3 case-study-applications as noted earlier , there are six types of applications for case-study methods-illustrative , exploratory , critical-instance , implementation , program-effects , and cumulative . but case-study-reports commonly use only two of the six applications : illustrative and critical-instance . greater-use could be made of the four others in selecting alternative-ways of answering-questions , because these may be able to give information that is more valuable to customers than other techniques . also , improvements can always be made in how even the two approaches already used frequently are carried out , especially in the area of selecting-instances for study . the next-sections summarize , for each of the six types , the evaluation-questions they can answer , the functions they perform , their design-features , and their pitfalls . the last-section shows what basis for selecting-sites is appropriate for each of the six applications . as table 3.1 indicates , illustrative-case-studies illustrative primarily describe what is happening and why , in one or two instances , to show what a situation is like . this can help in the interpretation of other data , particularly if we have reason to believe most readers know too little about a program or situation to understand fully the information from surveys or other methods . design-features site selected as typical or representative of important variations ; small number of cases to keep reader 's interest ; data often include visual-evidence ; analysis concerned with data-quality and meaning ; and reports use self-contained , separate-narratives or descriptions pitfalls may be difficult to hold reader 's interest while presenting in-depth-information on each illustration ; may not adequately represent situations where considerable-diversity exists ( in such situations , it may be impossible to represent variety well enough to use illustrative-case-studies ) ; and may not have time on-site for in- depth-examination gao has many examples of such illustrative-use . in 1982 , for instance , ced examined housing block grants through a survey supplemented by case-studies . the results of the survey were published in the main-report ( u.s. general-accounting-office , december 13 , 1982 ) . for three of the sites ( pittsburgh , seattle , and dallas ) , individual-reports described what each city was like with regard to housing and housing-related-activities and how the money was page 38 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations used in that city and included before-and-after-pictures of what rehabilitation meant for individual-neighborhoods and houses ( u.s. general-accounting-office , march 24 , 1982 ; march 30 , 1982 ; april 30 , 1982 ) . in a similar-application , hrd described the projects funded under the emergency job appropriations-act of 1983 in communities in texas , alabama , california , georgia , and massachusetts ( u.s. general-accounting-office , march 26 , 1985 ; august 27 , 1985 ; september 25 , 1985 ; december 6 , 1985 ) . illustrative-case-studies are used by evaluators in other agencies . when the department of health and human-services was trying out delivery of head start services to parents and children in their own homes , called home-start , the department supplemented a formal-assessment of the development of the children before and after the program with case-studies ( high/scope educational research foundation , 1972 ) . these case-studies described what services were delivered , the conditions in rural as well as urban-areas , and what the home-start teachers did during the home-visits and generally provided a surrogate or vicarious-experience for readers who might never have visited a head start or a home-start center . the case-studies told , too , of the development of the program over time and helped give a realistic-sense of problems in start-up and implementation , how changes in staffing were accommodated , and the impact of shifting federal-guidance on efforts to carry out the program in the field . case-studies such as these are well accepted as a valid way of amplifying a more systematic-presentation via the realism and vividness of anecdotal-information . there are , however , pitfalls in presenting illustrative-case-studies . the most serious is selecting the instances . the case or cases must page 39 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations adequately represent the situation or program . this is relatively-easy if the program is small and homogeneous . where considerable-diversity exists , it may not be possible to select a '' typical '' site , and the diversity may be so great that to represent it adequately would require more case-studies than most people would want to read for illustrative-purposes . in the example of privately operated detention-facilities , an illustrative-case-study might run the risk of oversimplifying a more complex-situation . the example was contrived to illustrate exactly this point : that sometimes we can not select a site that fits our needs and thus the method is not appropriate . however , in many real-world-situations , it is possible to represent diversity adequately for illustrative-purposes and to obtain the benefits of this application : helping-readers feel , hear , see , `` be there '' when this kind of surrogate-site-experience is necessary to undo stereotypes or explain a situation otherwise inaccessible for most people . such a situation might be a bilingual-education-class , about which stereotypes can abound , or life aboard a nuclear-weapon-equipped-submarine , a situation few readers will ever experience themselves but may need to get a feel for in order to understand staff-selection , training , and management on modern submarines . the exploratory-case-study is a shortened-case-study , exploratory undertaken before launching into a large-scale investigation . its function is to develop the evaluation-questions , measures , designs , and analytic-strategy for the bigger study . as table 3.2 indicates , it is most helpful where considerable-uncertainty exists about program-operations , goals , and results . also rather than initiate a job requiring 1,000 staff days or more , page 40 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations when we do not have an adequate-on-the-shelf-set of designs and measures , an exploratory-case-study can save time and money in implementation as well as improving the confidence we have in our results . we can aim more precisely and hit the target more often . functions where considerable-uncertainty exists about program-operations , goals , and results , exploratory-case-studies help identify questions , select important-measurement-constructs , develop actual-measures for these , which can be used later in larger-scale-tests ; formulate-expectations ; safeguard investment in larger studies ( for problems or programs that are not well-developed ) design-features site selected : needs at least one site that represents each important-variation to make a convenience-sample acceptable ; number of cases sufficient to cover diversity ; data focus on program-operations and on-site-observation , are not longitudinal but need enough-time to find out what is going on ; analysis is closely concurrent with field-work but does not require strong-chain of evidence or audit-trail ; reports are usually-internal or parts of larger , longer reports pitfalls-temptation to prolong the exploratory-phase ; site-selection only for convenience , inadequate-coverage of diversity ; prematurity -exploratory findings released as conclusions ; over-involvement in evaluator 's own hunches so that initial-findings are confirmed rather than tested some of our scoping-work already may involve exploratory-case-studies . for example , in ggd , a design-study was done as a separate job , culminating page 42 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations in a briefing , prior to an in-depth-study of the implementation of the bail reform act of 1984 . the methodology included 90 interviews , observations , and data-analysis from the population of 94-court-districts selected purposively for their characteristics on significant-variables . researchers and experts in the field were also interviewed . an expert-panel was used to give feedback at various-points to make sure we had a comprehensive-picture of the situation . the product of this exploratory-case-study was a briefing , with the study-design-choices described , including detailed-research-questions , outlines of data-sources , significant-variables , extant-data-bases , and site-selection-criteria . from this , a larger study was designed to meet the needs of the requester . other jobs may involve similar-efforts that are not , however , reported as separate-jobs and thus are less visible as exploratory-case-studies . also reports that include some features of exploratory-case-studies have been issued by gao . in 1985 , for example , nsiad examined emerging-issues in export-competition through a case-study of the brazilian-market ( u.s. general-accounting-office , september 26 , 1985 ) . combining-site-visits to brazil , japan , west germany , and france , interviews with many officials of appropriate-agencies and from the private sector , examination of official-government files , and a questionnaire-survey of high technology-firms active in the brazilian-market , the evaluators amassed a rich-array of contextual and focal-information and identified four trade practices considered to be key-factors in export-competitiveness in brazilian-markets . these were bilateral-trade-accords , countertrade , export-financing , and compliance with trade-related industrial-policy . although to meet the requirements of the job , nsiad did not need to test these factors for generalizability to other countries through a later page 43 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations study , the product would permit such testing . nsiad is using the findings in this way , as part of its ongoing-work on bilateral initiatives . of particular methodological-note in this report is the detailed-explanation of why export-competitiveness in brazilian-markets ( the instance ) was selected for the case-study . the exploratory-case-study has been used by agencies outside gao . the department of justice , for example , supported an exploratory-case-study of the career criminal-program ( chelimsky and dahmann , 1980 ) . the career criminal-program aimed at `` swift and certain '' justice by trying to expedite and strengthen processing of individuals who had long criminal-histories at the time of apprehension . the exploratory-study looked in depth at four of the nine-demonstration-sites prior to conducting a program-effects evaluation . the evaluators identified the key-elements of the programs as implemented and what measurable-changes were likely to occur and developed-measures of the outcomes , as well as designs for testing-cause and effect in the subsequent larger study ( chelimsky and sasfy , 1976 ) . the greatest pitfall in the exploratory-study is prematurity : that is , the findings may seem so convincing that it can be difficult to resist pressures to report on these as if they had the strength of the larger study . also , care must be taken to scope and sequence the exploratory-study so that it yields enough-information to be worthwhile and in time for use in the larger study but does not unduly delay answering the questions through the larger study . in addition , it is inappropriate to use the scoping-phase as an ad hoc exploratory-case-study accompanied by an urge to issue the product at the end of scoping , when the necessary-procedures for an exploratory page 44 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations case-study with regard to such issues as instance-selection have not been followed . the critical-instance is the most frequent-application critical-instance of the case-study-method in gao , so much so that it may be seen as a `` usual gao review '' rather than recognized as what it can be-a case-study ( u.s. general-accounting-office , january 22 , 1981 ; april 23 , 1982 ; october 30 , 1985 ) . the advantage of recognizing the approach as an application of case-study-methods is that some aspects of the method-such as the close-yoking of data-collection and analysis-that may not be widely used now could be applied in a way that increases timeliness without reducing-quality . ( this technique , discussed in more detail in the section on analysis , can increase efficiency by reducing-collection of data and large-scale analyses of these data that subsequently do not prove useful . ) the critical-instance-case study examines one , or very few , sites for one of two purposes . first , a very frequent-application is the examination of a situation of unique-interest , such as three mile island , the challenger disaster , or allegations concerning funding for a specific presidential campaign . there is little or no interest in generalizability . the instance is not `` selected '' by us ; rather , we are called to it . gao conducts many critical-instance-studies . one example , already mentioned , was our review of the representation of foreign-interests by former very high government officials ( u.s. general-accounting-office , july 11 , 1986 ) . another is pemd 's review of the readiness of the big eye bomb for production ( u.s. general-accounting-office , may 23 , 1986 ) . yetanother is rced 's review of a construction-contract-award at jean lafitte national historical park ( u.s. general-accounting-office , september 26 , 1987 ) and page 45 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations their examination in a separate-report of the park-service actions at delaware water gap national recreation area in awarding a lease , closing a camp-ground , and raising a house-rent ( u.s. general-accounting-office , october 28 , 1987 ) . a second , rare , application is where a highly generalized or universal-assertion is being called into question , and we are able to test it through examining one instance . in one such study , ggd examined whether national-policies , procedures , and practices with regard to cargo-imports were causing problems in port-operations ( u.s. general-accounting-office , december 1986 ) . the port of new york offered a critical-test because , given the diversity of imports and the volume of work , if problems were occurring , they would be likely to show up clearly in this site . if no problems were observed , problems in other sites were unlikely . ggd used-observations , interviews , and document analysis at three sites in the port of new york and supplemented these with a small number of less intensive-observations at other sites . the method , in this instance , was sufficient to permit recommendations that were systemwide and generalizable with the single-case . table 3.3 summarizes the features of the critical-instance-case study . as noted , the method is particularly suited for answering cause-and-effect-questions about the instance of concern . it provides assurance that we have not prematurely overlooked important factors , that we have not been swayed by information from limited or perhaps biased sources , and that we have taken context into account , thus giving a fair and balanced-picture of the situation . page 46 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations perhaps the biggest pitfall in this application is insufficient specification of the customer 's question . that is , the job may be presented to us as if only that situation is of concern , but the underlying-question may call for a broader look at the issue . a request to investigate the reasons for the bank-failures in ohio , for example , may reflect an interest only in ohio , but it could be a `` tip of the iceberg '' question . what the customer may really want to know is whether other states are likely to have similar problems . in such a situation , ohio might be selected as a site to examine but we would also need to look at other states or use other approaches to achieve the generalizability needed . this then rules out the critical-instance-method as appropriate for this job . the importance of probing the underlying-questions in a request to achieve good-specification of the evaluation-question is not unique , of course , to the critical-instance-case study but it is crucial in its appropriate-application . we frequently are asked whether a program has been implemented and , often , whether implementation is in compliance with congressional-intent . the program-implementation case-study is helpful where enabling-legislation offers considerable-flexibility . in such cases , a wide variety of expenditures or actions could be consistent with legislation and compliance with page 48 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations design-features site selects itself in specific-problem-for decisive-testing , have to assume uniform-system with regard to issue and so convenience-sample acceptable ; number of cases is usually one instance ; comprehensive-data for specific-problem-for decisive-testing , need more modeling , hypotheses , and targeting to know what to study ; data-analysis and collection concurrent and interactive : data feed new collection , and emphasis on ruling out alternative causes ; report describes instances , presents conclusions about cause , gives evidence pitfalls inappropriate-selection of this technique as real-issue may not be specific-problem ( e.g. , ohio bank-failure ) but more general questions ; premature-closure may narrow causal-search too early ; overgeneralization from evidence program-implementation intent may be a matter of understanding the process by which decisions were made , who was involved , and whether the actions are meeting local-needs . one example is the 1981 legislation consolidating many small-categorical-grants into larger block grants , the funds for which could be spent very flexibly . another situation where program-implementation case-studies may be called for is when concern exists about implementation-problems . in-depth , longitudinal-reports of what has happened over time and why can set a context for interpreting a finding of implementation variability : that is , whether there seem to be basic structural problems or if the program understandably requires time for installment , adaptations , and building an infrastructure . in some instances , gao has been able to follow fairly intensively the implementation of programs or activities . one example is ggd 's series of reports on how the 1980 census was conducted . gao evaluators , in addition to being `` on the scene '' due to their location at the major-audit-site accompanied-enumerators into the field and examined , in depth , census procedures at field-offices . in other instances , we have spent somewhat less elapsed-time in the field , with less direct-observation , and with greater reliance on interview and documentary-evidence . in 1985 , for example , rced was asked how the department of interior was implementing the office of management and budget 's circular a-76 , dealing with privatization of all appropriate-services . the request overlapped with another similar-request . this request reflected a senator 's special-interest in the glacier national park in montana . the evaluators were able to combine the jobs in a review that eventually involved-information from 8 of 17 national park-service regional-offices and 19 of 402-field-offices . the report aggregates findings across these page 49 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations sites and concludes that agencies have been slow to implement the circular , although progress has been made since 1982 ( u.s. general-accounting-office , march 15 , 1985 ) . another example is gao 's review of 23 federal-agencies ' efforts to implement the federal-managers ' financial-integrity act of 1982 . a series of case-studies , together with an overview-report , was produced . among these , rced 's review of the department of commerce implementation , to take one report , examined the actions commerce took that were intended to improve internal-controls , such as training senior financial-analysts in evaluating-applicants and borrowers in the troubled eda business loan program and overhauling the way in which computer-resources were used for the national weather service . rced also examined the results of these efforts and highlighted-priority-areas for further improvement , such as better information on results for internal-management-purposes . table 3.4 summarizes the design , data-collection , analysis , and reporting-features of program-implementation case-studies . usually , in such studies , generalization is wanted and care is required to negotiate the question with the customer ( best situations ? worst ? typical ? ) and to match instance-selection carefully with the questions . unless the program is small and homogeneous , the evaluator faces two possibilities . the first possibility is that the number of instances will need to be fairly-large in order to achieve the generalizability wanted , and , as a consequence , skill will be needed to manage data-collection with sufficient flexibility to obtain the insights-case-studies offer and sufficient-structure to permit cross-site-aggregation of findings . the second possibility is that the diversity will be so great that it would be impossible to have enough-instances to page 50 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations meet needs for generalizability and still manage the data-collection and analysis . table 3.4 : program-implementation case aspect examined-characteristic studies evaluation descriptive , normative-questions functions learn what implementation has been achieved , understand unexpected-aspects ; understand reasons why implementation looks the way it does ; useful when enabling-legislation has given flexibility design-features site-selection can not be convenience because usually generalization wanted , and purposive-sample can be typical and representative of diversity and best and worst cases ; number of cases depends on program-diversity since generalization usually wanted ; data rely on common-instruments , published-documents , and observation ; reports are varied in theme , site , chronology , and narration pitfalls bias detection-methods may be inadequate ; may fail to take into account diverse-views about program-goals and purposes ; competence of all on-site-observers may not be sufficiently high ; can be costly due to study size ; the demands of data-management , data-quality control , validation-procedures , and analytic-model ( within site , cross site , etc . ) may lead to cutting too many corners to maintain quality an important-requirement for good-program implementation case-studies is investment of enough-time on site to get longitudinal-data and to obtain page 51 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations breadth of information . if the purpose is to report what is happening in a descriptive-sense only , short-site visits together with administrative-records may provide adequate-bases for findings . if , however , the evaluation-question requires gao to report on how satisfactory-progress is or the reasons for problems in implementation , the more staff who can be on site over time , with the richest or `` thickest '' base for examining the situation as the many people involved see it , the sounder our causal-conclusions and subsequent-recommendations will be . the multiple-sites usually required for program-implementation questions impose demands on training and supervision needed for quality-control . because of tight-resources , lack of travel-funds , and the need to use staff with uneven-experience and skills , this becomes critical in situations involving many evaluators working in different-regions . that is , time is needed to train staff adequately in such case-study-techniques as the note-taking required for thick-descriptions , which is in turn required for the content-analysis of themes in the instance . it is possible , for example , for two persons to interview the same informant and find that one has used a one-sentence-summary for a detailed , rich , 5-minute discourse while the other captured much more of the complexity and essence of what was said and what was happening . table 3.5 illustrates such a difference . table 3.5 : illustration of differences in note-taking situation-technique-characteristic in an interview with the director of rich notes `` the director indicated that the national science foundation procedures had changed three program for grants to small-times since the inception of the colleges , the following-question is program . in the first 4 years , asked : `` how does your program-announcements were mailed to the inform the eligible-colleges of the individual named as president in the opportunity to apply for grants ? '' listing , for the same year , of the american association of small colleges . because applications were very sparse , with about 30 % of eligible-colleges applying , the procedure was changed to a two-stage-mailing , first to the president to find out the name of the official in charge of federal-programs and then to the official . this worked well for a 5-year period , in terms of receipt of applications from over 80 % of the eligible-colleges , but when overall federal-funding for research was reduced , the positions of federal-program-coordinators were abolished and applications fell to about 40 % of eligible-institutions responding . two years ago , the decision was made to mail copies to the persons listed as chairs of the relevant-science-college in appropriate professional-association listings . this has increased the cost of outreach by about $ 15,000 or about 25 % more than the prior system . to date , returns are at the 80 % rate again .

'' program-effects-case studies can determine the effects of programs and reasons for success ( or failures ) . in 1982 , for example , rced examined the progress made since the 1970 's in cleaning up the nation 's air , water , and land , finding that while strides had been made toward meeting the established-goals ( cleaner air , properly treated wastewater , more drinkable-water ) , deadlines had been extended and unresolved-issues made meeting even these deadlines difficult ( u.s. general-accounting-office , july 21 , 1982 ) . we pointed to lack of flexibility as a source of cascading-problems and delays . the bases for these conclusions were in-depth-case-studies of three sites ( cleveland , dallas , and new york city ) together with information from reports prepared by six federal-agencies and by environmental-organizations and public-interest-groups and interviews with environmental-protection agency-officials . particularly-notable methodologically in this report is the integration of case-study findings with other sources of information throughout the first volume . a pemd report has focused on water-quality : the effectiveness of efforts to improve water-quality and the reasons for successes and failures . in-depth , very extensive-case-studies of several-water catchment-areas were conducted , and the final-report is based on a synthesis of the findings from the case studies-another-example of integration of findings across diverse-sites ( u.s. general-accounting-office , december 17 , 1986a , b ; september 19 , 1986 ) . this series of reports also is useful for illustrating the way in which causality is established in case-studies : through development of internally consistent-explanations of what led to what and the conscientious-use of information from within the site and from contrasting-sites to rule out alternative-explanations . page 54 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations for another example , to determine whether actions taken by the states since the mid-1970 's to address medical-malpractice insurance reduced-insurance-costs , the number of claims filed , and the average-amount paid per claim , hrd conducted-case-studies in six selected-states ( arkansas , california , florida , indiana , new york , and california ) . work included obtaining-views of organizations representing-physicians , hospitals , insurers , and lawyers on perceived problems , actions taken to deal with them , results of these actions , and the need for federal-involvement . other information came from surveys of nonfederal-hospitals about the sources , coverage-limits , and costs and claims from leading insurers in each state and , for comparison , the same type of information from a nationwide-company . the results are presented separately in six case-study-reports and aggregated in the overall report ( u.s. general-accounting-office , december 31 , 1986 ) . other federal-agencies have used the case-study-method successfully in answering program-effects questions . the national science foundation , for example , assessed the effectiveness of a cooperative-science-program aimed at increasing-innovation and knowledge-transfer between university and industry-researchers . ten case-studies were undertaken of a carefully selected group of projects that ranged from computer-language-systems through nuclear science to fisheries-biology and chemical-engineering . of note is the methodological-detail given on project-selection , data-collection , analysis , and case-format . in a companion-report , results from a survey of grant-recipients are analyzed , giving both a quantitative and a qualitative-sense of how the program was working . results from the two methods were not integrated ; both suggested , however , that the program was generally working well ( national science foundation , 1984 ) . page 55 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations table 3.6 summarizes key-features of program-effects-case studies . like the program-implementation case-study , the evaluative question often requires generalizability and , for a highly-diverse program , it may not be possible to answer the questions adequately and still have a manageable-number of sites . table 3.6 : program-effects-case studies aspect examined-characteristic evaluation-questions cause and effect , can be stand alone or multimethods and can be conducted before , during , or after other methods functions determine impact and give strong-inference about reasons for effects design-features site-selection depends on program-diversity , can not be used with highly-diverse programs ; best , worst , representative , typical , or cluster-bases appropriate ; must keep number of cases manageable or risk becoming minisurvey , can use survey before or after to check generalizability or mix-survey with concurrent-case-studies selected for special-purposes ; data rely on observation and structured-materials , often combine qualitative and quantitative-data ; analysis uses varying-degrees of formalization around emergent or predetermined-themes ; reports are usually thematic and describe site-differences and explain these ; variation in degree of integration of data across sites and of findings from different-methods pitfalls not collecting the right-amount of data ; not examining the right-number of sites ; insufficient-supply of well-trained evaluators ; difficulties in giving-evaluators enough-data collection-latitude to obtaining-insight without risking-bias there are some methodological-solutions to this problem . one solution would be to conduct the case-studies first in a set of sites chosen for representativeness and to verify the findings from the case-study through targeted-examination of page 56 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations administrative-data , prior-reports , or a survey . a second solution would be to use these other methods first . after identifying the findings of particular-interest , case-studies would be conducted in sites selected to maximize the ability to get the specific-understanding required . both of these approaches have been used with good-effect in program-evaluation . this relatively new and not as yet widely used cumulative application of case-study-methods brings together the findings from case-studies done at different-times . the applications previously discussed that involved multisite-case-studies are cross-sectional : that is , information from several-sites is collected at the same time . in contrast , the cumulative-case-study aggregates information from several-sites collected at different and even quite extended-times . the cumulative-case-study can be retrospective , aggregating information across studies done in the past , or prospective , structuring a series of investigations for different-times in the future . the techniques for ensuring sufficient-comparability and quality and for aggregating the information are what constitute the '' cumulative '' part of the methodology . that is , the cumulative-case-study is similar to an evaluation-synthesis , in that it is a method for aggregating the findings of several-studies . it differs from an evaluation-synthesis in that special-techniques are required to aggregate the qualitative-information that often is a feature of case-studies and to maintain the sense of the `` instance as a whole '' in its complexity that distinguishes case-studies from surveys of several-sites . for some jobs , both case-study and noncase-study-reports can be aggregated , page 57 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations each using the appropriate-techniques , in order to produce capping-reports or similar-products . gao does not appear to have done a cumulative-case-study using our own case-study-reports or other case-studies . gao reports have been used with good-results , however , in cumulative-case-studies published by others outside gao . one example is a book on bureaucratic-failures , which is based entirely on gao reports of management-problems in different-agencies over a considerable period of time ( pierce , 1981 ) . the author began with a set of hunches or hypotheses about what can go wrong in agency-management , and what would be evidence-supporting-or-contradicting-these hypotheses . he reviewed the gao reports in detail , analyzed the data from each one in terms of his framework , and aggregated the results in his final-chapter . other examples of cumulative-case-studies come from two international-agencies . a retrospective cumulative-case-study was conducted by the world bank in its examination of four in-depth-case-studies of the effectiveness of educational-programs . these case-studies were intended initially as stand-alone-assessments of the programs but were brought together to learn about the effectiveness of the evaluations themselves in the context of educational-programs ( searle , 1985 ) . a prospective cumulative-case-study was commissioned by the u.s. agency for international development . the purpose was to identify input and process components of economic-assistance that could be quantitatively associated with differences in outcome-measures . the method was the specification of a common-set of data ( both qualitative and quantitative ) to be collected over a 5-year period as projects were initiated , together with a means of coding the data across the 47 studies eventually completed . the coded results were page 58 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations analyzed quantitatively in the final-report ( finsterbush , 1984 ) . table 3.7 : cumulative-case-studies aspect examined-characteristic evaluation-questions cause and effect functions retrospective-cumulation allows generalization without cost and time of conducting numerous new case-studies ; prospective cumulation also allows generalization without unmanageably-large numbers of cases in process at any one time ; strengthens inference from new studies by combining with results from older studies design-features uses site-selection and usually a large number of cases ; data as reported ( retrospective ) ; usually-on-site observation ( prospective ) ; backfill-techniques ; analysis uses case-survey-method to cumulate findings ; possible to examine interactions directly since number of instances is large ; reports may resemble evaluation-syntheses ( continued ) aspect examined-characteristic pitfalls-publication-basis may severely limit generalization ; inadequate or uncertain-quality of original-data ; quality of data-reduction-procedures may be very difficult to determine ; the effects of changes in many contextual-factors over time may be difficult to separate from effects of the programs two features of the cumulative-case-study , shown in table 3.7 , are the case-survey-method just described as a means of aggregating findings ( lucas , 1974 ; yin and heald , 1975 ; yin et al. , 1976 ) and backfill-techniques ( berger , 1983 ) . the latter are helpful in retrospective-cumulation as a means of obtaining-information from the authors that permits an otherwise unusable-case-study to be included in the aggregation . knowing the basis on which the case instances were selected , for example , is crucial in cumulation ; otherwise it is not possible to know whether best case , worst case , typical , or the like instances are being aggregated . some published case-studies do not provide sufficient-detail on this . in backfilling , the evaluator might call the author , visit the author to review the original-data , or contact-others who were knowledgeable about the design-decisions in order to get adequate-information on instance-selection . opinion varies as to the credibility of cumulative-case-studies for answering-program-implementation and effects-questions . one authority notes that publication-biases may favor programs that seem to work , which could lead to a misleadingly positive-view ( berger , 1983 ) . other experts are concerned about the quality page 60 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations of the original-data and analyses and problems in verifying their quality ( hoaglin et al. , 1982 ; yin , 1989 ) . for the cumulative use of gao reports , these concerns are less important , since we already use the `` audit-trail '' procedures recommended in the policy and other manuals for verification of data-collection and analysis quality . we do , however , have the opposite-concern : that is , we would need to be sure there was not `` bad news '' selectivity in a particular-area , associated with killing-jobs that did not identify problems during scoping . design-decisions and case-study-applications in earlier sections , we discussed seven bases for purposive-selection of instances and six applications of the case-study-method , each of which was associated with a different-evaluation purpose or question . bringing this information together , table 3.8 shows the relations among case-study-applications and design-decisions . for example , if the purpose of the study is illustrative , an appropriate-basis for site-selection could be typical , representative , or cluster ; the case-studies would be conducted concurrently with other methods used in the main-study ; prestructuring or guidance to the evaluators in the field would be low to moderate to permit the thickness and richness of insights needed ; data could be qualitative only or both qualitative and quantitative ; the case-studies probably would be analyzed within sites only ; and the reporting would probably be narrative . chapter 4 data-collection and analysis data-collection we have said that the features distinguishing-case-studies from other methods are how sites are selected , how the data are collected , and how they are analyzed . in the last-chapter , we covered instance-selection . we turn now to other elements that distinguish a case-study from a not-case-study and a good-case-study from a not-good-case-study . the discussion is an introduction to the approaches . in other transfer-papers on program-evaluation , we have emphasized the importance of validity . validity involves measurement and also design . a valid-measure-that is , one with construct validity-reflects what it claims to reflect and not something else . for example , whether or not there are active opposition parties may be a more valid-measure of whether a country is a democracy than how many people vote in an election . a valid cause-and-effect-design-that is , one with internal-validity-rules out alternative-explanations of results by comparing what happened with an intervention to what happened in the absence of the intervention . for example , in a study of the effects of an employment-training-program , greater employment of participants after the training than before must be shown to be due to the training and not simply to better economic conditions , which also could increase employment . measurement case-study-methods can use two tactics for achieving measurement-validity : multiple-sources of evidence validity and using the chain-of-evidence-technique in data-reduction . multiple-sources of turning first to multiple-data-sources : case-studies require `` thick '' description in order to get enough-evidence information to check for trends , to rule out competing page 63 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations explanations , and to corroborate findings . eight techniques are used-sometimes all of them in the same study-to collect information ( neustadt and fineberg , 1978 ; yin , 1989 ) . 1 . collect physical-articles . 2 . collect documents such as contracts , memos , andreports . 3 . examine archives such as lists of persons served , computerized-order-records . 4 . conduct open-ended-interviews . 5 . conduct focused-interviews . 6 . conduct structured-interviews and surveys . 7 . undertake direct-observations . 8 . carry out participant-observations . many of the eight techniques are discussed in the general policy manual , chapter 8.0 . of these ways , the approaches that most differentiate case-studies from other techniques are direct-observation and participant-observation . gao has used both approaches in its jobs . for example , in nsiad 's study of conditions on submarines , auditors spent-time aboard submarines in a variety of situations , getting firsthand knowledge of life in these vessels . their direct-observations-form the primary-data-source for our report . we went to sea in this instance , however , in our gao role , as auditors and evaluators and so-it could be argued-might have seen what special-guests see and not what life would be like for the average-sailor . page 64 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations to get more authentic-information , evaluators have sometimes become participants in situations , not identified to the other persons involved as gao staff . one example of how we have adapted this participant-observer-approach was in ggd 's study of the services available to taxpayers from irs after irs reduced the number of public-information-agents ( u.s. general-accounting-office , april 5 , 1984 ) . wedeveloped a set of standard income tax questions about which citizens typically would call irs , obtained irs agreement on the correct-answers to these questions , and then , on a probabilistic-sampling-basis , called irs offices around the country to seek help . we used-names such as gerald a . office in these conversations but did not say we were from gao . we were able to report how long it took to get the phone answered , how long it took to get information , the consistency of information , and general-helpfulness of the responding-agent . such an approach gave more authentic-information than relying only on irs records of calls received , or a survey of taxpayers . in the first instance , irs would have no record of time before the person could get through to an agent and of `` discouraged callers . '' in the second , a survey of taxpayers would have to be very large to get a good `` hit '' rate of individuals who sought assistance , and the diversity of individual-questions would have blurred-ability to interpret variation in irs responsiveness . hrd used a similar-approach in reviewing the social-security administration 's telephone-inquiry-program ; over 4,000 calls were made , with gao personnel taking the role of ordinary-citizens in asking the randomly selected , prepared-questions ( u.s. general-accounting-office , august 29 , 1986 ) . one element of data-collection that distinguishes case-studies from other techniques is that comprehensiveness of interviewing is very important . page 65 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations in order to learn the meaning of events to those involved in them , a key-element of case-studies , the views of more senior officials are not given greater weight than views of less highly placed persons . in fact , a case-study where the only people interviewed were senior officials would be seen as a not-good-case-study , in contrast to one where the views of individuals at all levels affected was obtained . for example , if we wanted to learn about how noncompetitive awards were reviewed in an agency , a good-case-study would obtain information from the agency-head , the head of the procurement division , the inspector-general 's office , the contracts-officer responsible for selected awards , staff involved in the reviews for these awards , counterpart-persons from the contractors ' procurement and program-operations-staff , and the legal-divisions within the agency and the contractors . we might shadow several-noncompetitive procurements , following their life-history from initiation through actual-awards , sitting in on meetings , and studying , over time , how the awards were handled . chain of evidence a chain of evidence is the sequence from observation to conclusions . in a strong-chain of evidence , an independent second evaluator could follow the first evaluator from original-observations , the `` raw '' or unreduced-data , through all the steps of data-aggregation and analysis , and conclude that the first evaluator 's findings were justified by the evidence and fairly represented it . this requires careful-organization of the files of original-observations , complete-documentation of the conditions of data-collection that are relevant to the trustworthiness and credibility of the information , and making transparent and reproducible the manner in which the evaluator moved from phase to phase of the analysis . some page 66 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations evaluators call such a procedure `` building an audit-trail '' and use procedures similar to indexing and referencing to establish both the construct-validity of the measures reported and the convincingness of the causal-explanations developed in the case-study ( halpern , 1983 ) . that is , they have an independent-evaluator review the equivalent of their workpapers rather than providing so much-detail in the report itself that a reader can come to the same conclusion . some information in a case-study is likely to be judgmental , particularly when observer and participant-observer-modes of data-collection are used . and the collection-process involves judgment calls of promising-leads and the meaning of initial-information . while documenting the basis for judgments can be more difficult than documenting nonjudgmental-information , overall the chain of evidence or audit-trail-techniques should not pose any greater difficulty for gao evaluators than our documentation-procedures for other evaluation-methods . case-studies , obviously , can generate a great deal of data-analysis data , data that need to be analyzed sufficiently and with appropriate-techniques in order to be useful . much is qualitative . as table 4.1 indicates , there are six general-features of data-analysis . four are essential to case-study-methods : iteration , ottr , triangulation , and ruling out rival-explanations . a unique-feature of case-studies is that data-collection and analysis are concurrent . in most methods , we plan for data-collection , then we collect the information , then we analyze it , and then we write the report . in case-studies , the data coming in are analyzed as they become available , and the emerging-results are used to shape the next-set of observations . page 67 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations the sequence in which this takes place is the ottr , which stands for `` observe , think , test , revise . '' after observations have been made in the first phase ( and during the observations , because that is a natural way for our minds to work ) , the evaluators think about the meaning of the information : what does it suggest about what is happening and why ? what else could explain what is going on ? the rival-explanations reproducibility of findings developing alternative-interpretations of findings and testing through search for confirming and disconfirming-evidence until one hypothesis is confirmed and others ruled out establish through analysis of multiple-sites and data over time plausible and complete-data analysis ends when a plausible-explanation has been developed , considering completely all the evidence specific-techniques for handling multisite-data-sets matrix of categories , graphic-data-displays , tabulating-frequency of different-events , developing complex-tabulations to check for relationships , and ordering-information chronologically for time-series-analysis second , or `` think , '' phase ends with specification of what new information would be needed to rule out alternative-explanations or confirm interpretations . this triggers the third-phase : test . in this phase , the page 69 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations evaluator collects more information , as required by the specifications from the `` think '' cycle . the data collected in the third-phase are not specified before the first phase : they emerge , often with surprises , from the initial-observations . the fourth phase is examination of the second round of data-collection and a revision of initial-interpretations and expectations-the `` revise '' phase . the revise phase may lead to another test-phase , if information from the second round of data-collection was insufficient to rule out alternatives , or if , during revision , new interpretations emerged . this iterative-process ends when a plausible-explanation has been developed and , at the end of a '' revise '' phase , there are no outlier or unexplained-data , no further interpretations possible , or it is clear that despite the most diligent-search for information , more is not available to further refine description and explanation . in case-study-methods , causality is established through the internal-consistency and plausibility of explanation , derived additively through the ottr sequence . this is in considerable contrast to other evaluation-methods , where control and comparison groups are used subtractively to rule out other reasons for a finding and establish firm-attribution . several-techniques have been developed recently forhandling handling multisite case-study-data sets . these includemultisite data setting up a matrix of categories , graphic-data sets displays , tabulating-frequencies , developing cross-tabulations , and time-series-analysis . matrix of categories in this technique , a coding-scheme is developed prior to data-collection . it is modified during data-collection and the ottr process and finalized after the evaluation-team has read through all the case page 70 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations graphic-data-displays materials . the categories are related to the evaluation subquestions ; for example , if a subquestion was `` how does the immigration and naturalization service monitor the conditions of confinement in privately contracted detention-facilities , '' coding categories might include who is responsible , how these persons get information , what they do with information received , evidence that minimum-standards are met , evidence of shortfalls , changes over time in monitoring , and conflicting-guidance or responsibilities . these categories might be put into a matrix by facility-size or groups served . the approach is similar to content-analysis , and the pemd transfer-paper on content-analysis gives further how-to information ( u.s. general-accounting-office , june 1982 ) . this is a family of techniques , some of which have been adapted for computers and some of which use wall-space . the evaluators immerse themselves in information on a site , following ottr . their initial-story of what is happening and why is displayed as a flowchart with a series of critical-paths for action . evidence supporting the story is arrayed in the display . the materials then are searched for counterevidence and subsidiary or branching-paths are laid out . as a satisfactory graphic is developed for one site , the evaluators turn to the next-site . the evaluators could at this point either modify the first graphic , based on information from the second site , or prepare an independent-flowchart . in the second approach , aggregation would come after all the sites had been charted , and the charts would be used as the data-base for aggregation . the graphic-techniques can be applied to an instance as a whole or to subcomponents . for example , if an analysis of life-threatening or fatal-incidents at page 71 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations tabulating-event-frequencies national-parks were needed , the evaluators might develop separate-graphics for events leading up to the incidents , the incidents themselves , and postincident-actions . more complex-case studies might need several `` layers '' or graphics ; less complex , few . another technique for analyzing multisite-case-data is identifying-events within each case-study ( `` meeting between jones and smith '' ; `` smith staff prepares recommendations '' ) and tabulating their frequency of occurrence . such a simple-tabulation can draw the evaluator 's attention to events that may be significant or to informal-networks and give a sense of actual ( as contrasted to on-paper ) organizational-relationships . divergences between observed and expected-patterns can be examined further to see what happens as a result of these meetings and identify potential-problem nodes : for example , when an expected high-communication node turns out to be , relatively speaking , a low-communication spot . complex-tabulations cross-tabulations of events can identify interactions and check the developing-story more formally . for example , service coordination is a popular-remedy for limited-funds . an evaluator in the field may observe that coordination among local-agencies funded through the same federal-agency is more frequent than coordination among local-agencies funded by different federal-departments . tabulations of actual-meetings and of consequent-actions for same-agency funded and different-agency funded services can help check out whether this impression is reliable . time-series-analysis organization of information within each site by time of occurrence , coupled with a systematic-analysis of contextual-influences on events , permits a page 72 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations basic-models for data-analysis nonquantitative time-series-analysis for case-study-data . the flow of events over time for each significant-actor and for significant-points in the series of events forms the organizing-framework for data-analysis within each site . such comparisons of when key-actions occurred , how well ( or poorly ) they were carried out , and what influenced both timing and quality of performance can be particularly-helpful in case-studies of program-implementation . in some instances , only one component of a case-study may be analyzed in this way . for example , a case-study of the effectiveness of a job-training-program might need to take into account general economic-trends , such as unemployment-rates in the community . a time-series comparing local-unemployment-rates with placement-rates for job-training-program participants could be computed quantitatively and changes interpreted through the more qualitative time-series-data about the program . two basic-models of data-analysis are pattern-matching and explanation-building . pattern-matching requires using-past experience , logic , or theory before the job begins to specify what we expect to find . the analysis then compares actual-findings to expectations . when the findings fit , the pattern is confirmed . when the findings do n't fit , the evaluator adjusts the expectations or elaborates them , building a subroutine that can explain the unexpected-findings . explanation-building is the inverse-procedure : starting with the observations , the evaluator develops a picture of what is happening and why . data are used to fill in the initial hunches , to change them , to elaborate on them . the first strategy matches findings to hypotheses or assumptions . the second uses the data to structure the hypotheses or assumptions . page 73 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations in either strategy , the evaluator needs to search the full-data base thoroughly for disconfirming-evidence , in order to avoid the pitfall of premature-conclusions and data-analysis ends when the best-fit possible has been reached between the observations and a statement about what they mean . in either strategy , expectations and explanations can be expressed as themes : a job dealing with bank-failures , for example , might have as themes-decisions about credit-risks , procedures for reviewing-decisions , or controls over the accuracy and recency of information on bank-solvency . a job dealing with employee-training might have as themes-decisions about training-needs , how employees are selected for training , how course-quality is monitored , or how employees and supervisors view the purpose of training . themes , in turn , can be analyzed within individual-sites first , then findings on each theme aggregated across sites . alternatively , all themes within one site can be analyzed first ; then data from the second ( and subsequent ) sites can be examined . theme analysis also can proceed in matrix-fashion . on the pemd afdc study , for example , evaluators were assigned as site-managers , responsible for understanding across themes all there was to know about the issues for their site . they also were assigned to individual-themes , such as health and employment , responsible concurrently for looking across all sites for information on their topic . this organization proved helpful in ensuring that reasons why a site showed up as an outlier for a given theme could be discussed by someone who knew the site as a whole . case-study-methods , like any other method , offer pitfalls and booby traps plenty of opportunity to go awry . two frequent page 74 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations concerns are the risks in using other people 's studies and in generalizability . impartiality the biggest risk when we use other people 's case-studies is that gao standards of impartiality may not have been met . there are three meanings of impartiality , one of which does not create problems . case-studies use as data the impressions and judgments of the evaluator , which are inherently-subjective . for a case-study-methodologist and for gao , if proper-care is taken , this should not be a problem . if we want to illustrate , for example , working-conditions for immigrant-laborers , we can report what the thermometers registered and we can also report , firsthand , how people were sweating and what it felt like to be out in the fields . such observation is part of the richness , immediacy , and `` thick '' description of a case-study . however , case-studies , like any other method gao uses , have to meet two other criteria of impartiality : accuracy and lack of bias , in the sense that the evaluator's personal , preconceived-opinions about a situation do not distort reporting and that the evaluator is scrupulously evenhanded in examining all sides of a situation . some authorities on evaluation-methods believe that case-studies reflect the author 's values in ways that can be difficult to detect . other experts conclude that three actions , taken together , are sufficient-safeguards for lack of bias and adequate-accuracy . these are ( 1 ) submitting-reports to people from whom data were collected and printing their critiques with the report , ( 2 ) use of multiple data-collection-methods within case-studies , and ( 3 ) adoption of the audit-trail or chain-of-evidence-technique . adequate supervisory-controls also are recommended . complying with these safeguards should give us no page 75 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations major-problems in our own jobs . the guidance would mainly expand the range of reviewers . we already conduct exit-conferences and , following the `` yellow-book '' and communications manual , submit draft-reports for agency-comments . we often use multiple-methods , and the audit-trail-technique now recommended for case-study-use was itself adopted from such auditing-procedures as workpapers and referencing , which are standard-practice with gao . we also require adequate supervisory-control through such means as prompt-review of workpapers . we would need to assure ourselves , however , that case-studies whose results we are going to use have adopted the same procedures for ensuring-impartiality . ( appendix iii gives a checklist for reviewing proposed or completed case-studies for quality . ) generalizability we often are asked questions where the customer wants in-depth-information that is nationally-generalizable , but frequently the issue may not yet be ripe for a national-study or we do not have the resources to collect in-depth-data from nationally representative-samples . using 4 , 10 , or 15 sites as case-studies might be feasible , but we would still need to be concerned about the risks in generalizability . a main-point of this paper is that generalizability depends less on the number of sites and more on the right-match between the purpose of the study and how the instances were selected , taking into account the diversity of the programs . an example of an efficient-combination of careful-specification of the purpose of the study matched with appropriate-site-selection is the ggd study of the productivity of the social-security administration 's ( ssa 's ) regional-operations . this review examined in depth only one ssa region ( u.s . page 76 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations general-accounting-office , september 11 , 1985 ) . atlanta was selected because it had the best productivity among the 10 regions ; if gao could demonstrate opportunities for improvement in the most productive ssa region , then similar-improvements might be possible in the less productive-regions . following the case-study , an inexpensive ( 25-staff-day ) check was made on productivity-data and trends from other ssa regions , and similarities were noted . while other problems might be affecting these less productive-regions , the findings from the single-site plus the trends were so convincing that ssa concluded the single-instance-examination had national-implications . subsequent-analysis of regional-office-plans for productivity-improvement led to the conclusion that their implementation could save about $ 60 million annually . sometimes , however , it is not possible to answer the evaluation-question using-case-studies , if the program is diverse and the user-needs national-generalizability . the user may prefer to sacrifice in-depth-information for generalizability and we will have to use other methods , such as surveys or secondary-analysis of existing-data . however , it often is possible-with appropriate-instance selection-to obtain adequate-generalizability with a manageable-number of instances . in addition , the evaluator can apply the case-survey-method to increase the generalizability of findings and can combine case-studies with other methods . taken together , these strategies can permit the use of the case-study-technique with enough-generalizability for many users ' purposes . that is , for the first three types of case-studies ( illustrative , exploratory , and critical-instances ) generalizability , if needed , can not be achieved unless they are combined with other methods . generalizability can be achieved for the three other types , however , even when they page 77 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations where to go for more information are used independently , as long as they are carefully designed in terms of case-selection and analytic-strategies . more detail on data-collection and analysis can be found in two books on case-study-methods : case-study research by yin ( 1989 ) and analyzing qualitative-data by miles and huberman ( 1984 ) . more detail on applicable gao guidance can be found in the communications manual . chapter 5 summary we can summarize this paper in the answers to three questions : what are case-studies ? when are they appropriately used in evaluation ? what distinguishes a good-case-study from a not-good-case-study ? the case-study is a method of learning about a complex-instance , based on a comprehensive-understanding of that instance obtained by extensive-description and analysis of the instance taken as a whole and in its context . applying this definition means learning virtually-everything about the instance being studied , including how it operates and what it does , in relation to the extrinsic or contextual-events it is part of . case-studies often use one or only a few instances , because collecting and analyzing comprehensive-data are prohibitively difficult for large numbers of sites . however , not all studies of a small number of instances are case-studies . some studies collect data from a small number of sites but have no other features in common with case-studies and offer-none of their advantages . thus , the fact that a study involves only one or a few sites does not automatically make it a case-study . for example , the evaluators may not have selected the sites appropriately for the generalizability needed or they may have collected minimal-information with little depth of inquiry . what are case-studies ? when are case-studies appropriately used in evaluation ? we discussed six types of case-study that differ considerably in their requirements for site-selection , data-collection , and analysis , among other things . the six types are illustrative , critical-instance , exploratory , program-implementation , program-effects , and cumulative . together , they cover a wide-range of evaluation-questions , although clearly not all page 79 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations what distinguishes a good from a not-good-case-study ? evaluation-questions . for example , case-studies are not well suited for answering the question , how often does something happen ? some applications of the case-study to evaluation-purposes have been tried fairly extensively-for-example , program-implementation case-studies . others are relatively untried-for-example , cumulative-case-studies . the latter is a particularly promising-method for gao , because it can capitalize on the large number of case-study-like-reports that are available , on the quality of the documentation that supports their findings , and on the general methodological-framework that gao 's standards provide . we have not stressed , in our analysis , the costs , feasibility , and timeliness of case-studies , since these are management-criteria that are considered in all designs rather than issues of particular-concern to case-studies . however , the implications of the design-features discussed here are that , contrary to what many people think , the case-study is not necessarily-inexpensive , easy to conduct , or quick . it may require in-depth-data-collection dependent on sensitivity to the setting that takes time to acquire and involve extended periods for data-analysis , interpretation , and reporting . we have addressed quality in two ways . one is prospective and intended to help those who plan evaluation to know the minimum features of the various case-study-applications . the other is retrospective and intended to help those who review case-study-reports to assess the quality of completed case-studies . table 5.1 summarizes common-pitfalls that we have mentioned throughout this paper . table 5.1 : some common-pitfalls in case-study study stage common-pitfall evaluation-design mismatch between criteria for the specific-job and what the case-study-application can do ; insufficient-attention to contrasts and comparisons needed for purposes of the study site-selection more sites selected than needed ; fewer sites selected than needed ; inappropriate-basis for site-selection , for the particular-job and evaluation-question data-collection reliability jeopardized by lack of common guidance in data-collection ; findings-noncomparable ; lack of quality-control in data-collector-roles and responsibilities : impartiality threatened ; overly loose-relationship between data collected and the evaluation-question ; inadequacy of information data-analysis insufficient-attention to requirements of analytic plan chosen : low-plausibility of results ; insufficient-attention to management and data-reduction : inefficiency , lateness , incomplete use of data ; inadequate-methods of relating-findings across sites ; inadequate-methods for relating-qualitative and quantitative-data within sites reporting quality and evaluation-design : planning study stage common-pitfall we have presented six types of case-study-evaluations and for each one described features such as number of sites , site-selection , data-collection , data-analysis , and reporting . our descriptions represent a `` floor '' of quality for each evaluation application . the features of the six types of case-study are not interchangeable . that is , the features of a case-study that are appropriate for answering one kind of evaluation-question are not necessarily-appropriate for answering another kind of evaluation-question . evaluators considering the case-study as a design for evaluation must first decide what type of evaluation-question their specific-question is and then examine the strengths and limitations of each type of case-study for answering it . the crucial next-step is to look at the features of each type and decide whether it will be possible to meet these methodological-requirements in the specific-situation . for example , the basis on which instances can be selected differs for the different case-study-applications . usually , an illustrative-case-study site should be typical of the program being examined page 82 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations overgeneralization , compared to actual-basis for site-selection , number of sites studied , and requirements for inference in the design ; inadequate-interpretation , unintegrated-narrative , results not adequately related to user-questions ; inadequate-attention to threats to impartiality and the extent to which these have been avoided quality of evaluation-design : reviewing while exploratory-case-study sites should bracket the diversity that is likely to be encountered in the program , population , and setting of a larger study . usually , sites for program-effects-case studies should be selected with great-care for criteria such as whether there is evidence that the program has been implemented at the site , whether the site has been subjected to changes that could have the same effects as the program or that could mask its effects , and how the addition of this site to the group of sites being studied supports the generalizability of the findings . turning to ways of assessing the quality of completed case-studies , we have provided guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports in appendix iii . these guidelines are intended to apply to all types of case-study-applications . on matters of design , the guidelines discuss the clarity of issues , the relationship of the evaluation-question to the case-study-application selected , the basis for case-study-selection , and the time-span of the study . the data-collection-guidelines emphasize appropriateness of data-collection-methods , evaluator training , and information-sources . guidelines for data-base formation and analysis-deal with explicitness of procedures and techniques , interpretation-differences , and the relationship of the findings to those of similar-studies . with regard to reporting , the guidelines emphasize constraints on the study , arguments for and against various-resolutions of the issues , and the role of judgment in reaching-conclusions . with regard to impartiality and generalizability , the guidelines emphasize that a good-case-study report ( or , for gao purposes , job-documentation ) describes both the evaluators ' training and work on related-studies , presents page 83 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations impartiality and generalizability comments on the draft-report , and supplies adequate-information for judging-generalizability . reviewers will need to refer in addition to the features of each special-type of case-study-application for supplementary-guidance on what to look for in individual-case-studies . partiality-and-in some instances-the-inability to generalize from the findings can limit the utility of case-study-methods for evaluation . there are three main-threats to impartiality : subjectivity , inaccuracy , and bias . the case-study-method inherently requires subjective and judgmental-elements . when proper procedural-safeguards are used , these elements alone do not diminish the value of case-study-methods . however , inaccuracy and bias are unacceptable in any case-study . some ways of detecting and preventing-bias , such as the audit-trail , have been well developed . their applicability to case-study-evaluations outside of settings such as gao is being explored . many evaluation-questions do not require a high degree of generalizability . certain case-study-applications provide high degrees of generalizability with small-numbers of instances . when both broad-generalizations and in-depth-understanding are required , designs that cumulate-case-studies over a wide-number of sites and settings , or that combine case-study-methods and other methods in one concurrent-effort may meet this dual need ( u.s. general-accounting-office , april 2 , 1984 ) . however , the diversity of the population to which generalization is required is a limiting-factor in case-study-applications . it is also true that without careful-attention to standards , case-studies are prone to the kind of overgeneralization that comes from selecting a few instances , assuming without evidence that they are typical or representative of the population and then offering national-projections . the gao project manual cautions against overgeneralization from any method . for case-studies in particular , there must be an empirical-basis for instance-selection and assurance of adequate-population homogeneity . appendix i theory and history as a research-method , the case-study originates in the social-sciences , particularly in the fieldwork of anthropology and sociology . within these disciplines , researchers have defined the case-study and discussed its critical-elements in a variety of ways . in general , six elements appear frequently : purpose , type of data collected , method of data-collection , design , method of data-analysis , and reporting . the research-case-study has been defined as a method purpose for learning the `` right '' questions to ask ( hoaglin et al. , 1982 ) . that is , the purpose of case-studies is said by some researchers to be to generate hypotheses rather than to test or confirm them . the method involves an in-depth , longitudinal examination of a single-instance . the product is a sharpened understanding of what might be important to look at further in similar-situations and what explains why the instance happened as it did . because such inquiry explores only one situation , it is argued that it can not contribute directly to the testing of general propositions , although it can contribute powerfully to the invention of hypotheses . some other methods have a similar-purpose . exploratory-analyses of large-data-bases are often used to select a smaller number of variables for additional-testing , on the basis of interesting patterns that emerged from various-combinations of the elements of the large-data-base . promising-relationships are singled out and those that seem uninteresting are set aside . like findings from case-studies , the result is considered as contributing not answers but a better understanding of what questions to ask and how to ask them . an analogy might be drawn also to `` evaluability-assessment . '' such assessment may provide page 86 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations information valuable in itself about how completely a program has been implemented . it is undertaken prior to testing the effects of the program , chiefly , however , as an indicator of appropriate evaluation-design . other researchers regard case-studies as not only a different way of knowing but as a better way ( rist , 1981a ; 1982a ) . more specifically , they emphasize the method 's unique-value in many complex-situations of importance , such as studies of school desegregation , or economically distressed-communities , or the challenger tragedy . one reason they give is that skilled-observers and interviewers can make judgments and valuations about factors that are otherwise very difficult to assess , such as how much effort a manager made to get information before a key-decision was made or how much that person knew about what was going on . also , these researchers believe , in complex-situations the many persons who are significantly involved have different `` realities '' in their explanation of events and even in their perceptions of what happened , and this is best matched with a method that gradually represents and reconstructs these multiple-realities , rather than a method that assumes a single `` truth '' exists . as seen by such scholars , '' there is no single-reality on which inquiry may converge , but rather there are multiple-realities that are socially constructed , and that , when known more fully , tend to produce diverging-reality . these multiple and constructed realities can not be studied in pieces ( as variables , for example ) , but only holistically , since the pieces are interrelated in such a way as to influence all other pieces . moreover , the pieces themselves are sharply influenced by the nature of the immediate-context . '' methodologists who focus on case-studies express their criteria of good-research in different-language , although they may deal with underlying-concerns page 87 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations similar to those of researchers from more experiment-oriented traditions . some criteria , however , are seen as unique to case-studies and qualitative-approaches . one example is fairness or assurance that a study has presented a balanced-view of the many constructions of reality and the values underlying these . another example is authenticity ; another , realism . each of these criteria is associated , in the literature on case-study-methods , with performance-standards such as triangulation believed useful in ensuring-if they are carried out-that the study will be a good one . type of data in some textbooks on evaluation , case-studies are synonymous with qualitative-data-that is , data that are subjective or judgmental . such data include narratives of events written by participant-observers , accounts of what the participants understood about an event , reports of what was said at a meeting or an interview , observational-records of how an event took place , and statements of impressions about what was going on , why it was happening , and how people felt about it , themselves , or each other . to illustrate differences among types of information , we might base the conclusion that `` the day was hot '' on data from an instrument that records the room-temperature ( numerical and objective ) , a record of the atmospheric-temperature as written down by an observer checking a thermometer ( numerical and relatively nonsubjective ) , a survey asking-people how hot they felt ( nonnumerical and subjective ) , and a `` thick '' description of what clothes-people were wearing , how much they perspired or shivered , whether they turned up the furnace or the air-conditioner , and how much-energy they seemed to have for work ( nonnumerical and judgmental ) . when researchers describe case-studies as using qualitative-data , they usually mean the `` thick '' description . if the evaluation-question involved an understanding of working-conditions for migrant-laborers or workers in heavy-industry , a thick description , even including-information on how exhausted the evaluator felt in the heat , would be more appropriate-according to some case-study-methodologists-than only recording that the thermometer registered 95 degrees . suppose we needed to know about the availability of housing for low-income-people . if official-records were adequate , good quantitative-measures of availability might be the number of low-income-persons applying for housing-relative to the number of units that met minimum-standards and cost within 30 percent of household-income or the number of persons on waiting-lists for such housing and how long they had to wait . we might also be able to report the number of applications for housing-construction-permits and how many units suitable for low-income-housing were coming on the market within 12 months . often , however , the records are not adequate . here we might rely on qualitative-information , such as the estimates of knowledgeable-officials of demand and supply ( judgmental , page 89 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations method of data-collection numerical ) or of severity of the problem ( judgmental , nonnumerical ) . we might also interview selected low-income-families with regard to their experience in seeking-housing or we might , as participant-observers , pose as low-income-applicants and report our own experiences in finding-housing for families of different-sizes and within different-payment ranges ( judgmental , numerical , and nonnumerical ) . many researchers who write case-studies use qualitative-data because they believe them to be richer , more insightful , and more flexible than quantitative-data . they believe that the meaning of an event is more likely to be caught in the qualitative-net than on the quantitative-hook . for example , qualitative-data-permit dealing fairly directly with values , politics , and factors that may be an important part of many situations . a frequency-distribution of events-such as a table showing the number of decision-points in a community economic-development-program and a decrease in the probability of action as the number of decision-points increases-are about as numerical as qualitative-data are likely to be in a research-case-study , according to some experts . to some researchers , case-studies are synonymous with methods of data-collection deriving from anthropology , psychology , and sociology . the techniques include fieldwork , ethnography , observation , and participant-observation and have in common that an observer is physically-present at a site , stays at the site for a fairly long time , has flexibility in deciding what data to collect from whom and under what circumstances , and can organize the inquiry according to the meaning of events to the participants rather than having to decide beforehand page 90 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations on a closed-set of constructs or data-elements . in most instances , the observer is the senior-investigator and the only researcher : margaret mead in samoa and oscar lewis in puerto rico are famous-examples . the greatest difference , to some experts , between other methods and case-studies is the distinction between the researcher 's ( 1 ) beginning by presuming , a priori , to know the relevant-constructs and variables , measuring their incidence , and finding out how changes in them may be influenced by other events and ( 2 ) entering into an event to learn what is significant in it to the participants . as this implies , to researchers , the case-study is an intensely personal-method , dependent on the investigator's sensitivity , insights , and skill in noticing many things , recording them , and producing a narrative that suggests a pattern of the elements-or that recognizes the pattern that is there in the culture in its own terms . it is a demanding-method , requiring specific-skills ( such as fluency in the language of the participants ) and general-self-awareness to maintain the fine balance between seeing-things as others see them and identifying their perspective wholly with one 's own . the researcher must weigh the value of experiencing what it is like to be part of the culture against the hazard of internalizing the experience too fully , which can jeopardize the capacity to see the culture from many perspectives . nonetheless , some of the best reports have come from observers who entered as fully as possible as participants in the event being investigated . the case-study-method is further distinguished by the researcher 's self-conscious-effort to understand what the observed events mean to the participants . no observer can enter a scene without preconceived-ideas , but they can be set aside . thus , a study of how a group is organized economically might begin with page 91 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations finding out what is valued in that group and how items of value are exchanged . they might not be goods or services , and exchanges might not be equal . for example , in a basic-research-study of 40 low-income-women , belle and her colleagues lived for many months among them as observers , confidantes , and friends , listening to what they said and noting what they did . the researchers found that turning to someone for even modest-help ( like minding a child for an hour ) had the cost of later-demands for a return of the favor and that this cost was nearly-intolerable . the researchers found expected stresses like the loss of a check in the mail and the illness of loved ones . they found also , unexpectedly , that any change at all was stressful : being promoted to a higher-paying-job , the graduation of a child from school , falling in love , even the restoration to health of a loved one who had been ill . in terms of the purposes of the study-finding out what was stressful to the women and why the incidence of mental-health-problems among them was so high-the case-study-method disclosed the importance of any change in life-circumstances as a source of stress rather than merely confirming-change that the observers might have thought stressful a priori . case-study-methods have been defined by some design researchers as designs that focus on a single-instance or a few instances . they also are identified with designs that are nonexperimental in the sense that the investigator is not deliberately manipulating some variable to see its possible-effects on the system being studied . two classic-aims of inquiry are to understand the nature of events and to understand their causes . since case-study-designs center on one or a few cases and lack the controls usually thought necessary to an understanding of causal relationships , knowledge that page 92 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations results from case-studies is controversial with regard to generalizability and causality . with regard to generalizability , some methodologists see case-studies as above all particular , seeking to describe and understand the aspects of an instance without much-concern for knowing whether they arise in or are characteristic of a larger population . the focus is on this school , this emergency-room , this military-base , or this nuclear-power-plant . researchers can choose relatively freely which instance to study on any one of several-bases , depending on the questions to be examined . thus , in a case-study-design , an instance may be selected because it is a unique-event of national-interest , such as the cuban-missile-crisis or the distribution of the swine-flu-vaccine , both subjects of research-case-studies . the instance may be selected because it has been affected by events of interest , such as the desegregation of schools . it may be selected as an unusually effective or unusually ineffective-instance . however , whenever the purpose is an understanding of the particular , the relationship of the instance to the various-populations that it is part of is less important than the assurance that the selected instance can be fully examined . with regard to causality , researchers using case-study-methods can not rely on familiar-ways of ruling out alternative-explanations . case-studies do not compare individuals or groups to others randomly assigned to different-treatments . case-studies do not use statistical-adjustments to facilitate comparison . case-studies do not estimate statistically the influence of the many variables on the instance being examined . to understand a single-case , the researcher must develop hunches about what is happening in the instance under study and systematically seek within it page 93 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations evidence consistent or inconsistent with the hunches . as evidence accumulates , a second tier of evidence is looked for that would be consistent or inconsistent with alternative-explanations for why the hunches did or did not take the shape of a coherent pattern . that is , a very high standard of inferential-logic is needed . when this method produces a coherent , plausible-story , the researcher can assert a relationship between cause and effect . when conflicting-evidence can not be resolved , the careful-investigator indicates that causality can not be established . the standard for making this judgment requires the diligence of the investigator in formulating alternative-explanations of what is happening , in specifying the kind of evidence that would be supportive or nonsupportive , in searching intensively for evidence that would rule out initial-hypotheses , and in thoroughly considering the reasons for inconsistent-patterns of evidence in the second tier . these techniques , of course , have parallels in other research traditions . the ability of the case-study to capitalize on insight , to shift focus as the data-demand , and to let disparate-pieces of evidence fall into place in ways that are not always-easy to describe or command is believed to yield a richer , fuller , and truer explanation of why things look the way they do than the more limited-number of tests of a priori hypotheses that other methods use . in case-studies , the criterion for deciding whether casuality has been established is the coherence of the evidence , its consistency with the patterns ascribed to it , and its inconsistency with other explanations . in research-designs based on statistical inference , the criterion for establishing-casuality is whether the findings are likely to have occurred by chance following appropriate-comparisons to eliminate alternative-interpretations . page 94 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations method of data-analysis in both instances , comparisons must be appropriate if alternative-explanations are to be ruled out . still another distinguishing-feature of case-studies , according to some researchers , is a nonstatistical-approach to data-analysis . the elements of analysis are familiar : the identification of regularities , patterns , and relationships and the assessment of their importance of meaning . in quantitative-methods , the regularities are identified by manipulating-numbers to produce indicators agreed on as sensible-descriptions of the patterns . for example , an average is a convention that creates a single-number to represent the collection of all the numbers in a set . importance or meaning is assessed in part by estimating the variability within the set of numbers to obtain a probability that the regularity represents the characteristics of the population of instances . the logic of analysis in case-studies is the same ; the techniques for identifying-regularities and assessing their meaning are different . consider first the regularities . the case-study-analyst is trying to build an accurate-description and explanation of events as both the observer and participants frame them . there would be little-point in trying to identify a single-number as an accurate-representation of something this complex . the analyst searches for clusters or paths in the data , using verbal-notes and graphic-aids , reviewing-field-data and other records of observations , until a pattern is evident . then the data-base is searched for further evidence that confirms or conflicts with the pattern . when the evidence is more inconsistent than consistent , the pattern is rejected . when the evidence is more consistent than not , the analyst confirms the pattern and looks for others related to it . when all the page 95 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations evidence is consistent , no further examination is needed . an array of techniques such as graphic-displays has been developed to help standardize case-study-analysis . a key-element of case-study-analysis is the selection and organization of material to account for the complexities and interactions of the events . the rules are judgmental , not probabilistic . have all the pieces of pertinent-information been considered ? has adequate-attention been given to the outliers ? does the pattern seem plausible or forced ? have inconsistencies been sensibly resolved ? using an analogy , we can say that the case-study-analyst seeks to explain 100 percent of the variance by relying on a data-base that includes more variables than most quantitative-studies can accommodate , over more points in time , and on a method that draws on the integrative-powers of the mind , which computers do not have . the method inherited from sociology and anthropology entails early immersion in the setting , recorded observations , reflections on the spot , and analysis that occur throughout fieldwork , as data are being collected . analysis is infused throughout the research process in case-studies ; it is not a step after the completion of data-collection . case-studies are usually reported as narratives that reporting read like chronologies of what led up to an event and what happened during and after it . they have been called '' then-they-did-this '' studies . in order to be comprehensive and cohesive , the researchers provide a great deal of detail and description and quote directly from the participants ' own words and vignettes in the observers ' field-records . to some proponents of case-studies , the credibility of the method depends on what they call `` naturalistic-generalizability . '' by this they mean that readers compare their own observations , experience , and belief to the narrative and regard the parts of the investigation that are consistent with these as confirmed . what is inconsistent tends to be examined more closely and may be rejected as less credible , unless-so the argument-runs-there is enough detail that readers can `` see it with their own eyes . '' for readers who know a handicapped-child or have an aging-parent , for example , a case-study-report of conditions in residential-care for the severely handicapped or the aged may compare dramatically with vivid personal-experiences . the case-study-report can provide an organizing-framework for thinking about these and other experiences . the usefulness of case-study-reports , therefore , depends to some degree on how well the investigator has portrayed the participants' ways of thinking about what happened and on how divergent the investigator 's analysis is from the reader 's ways of thinking about the subject . the credibility and authenticity of the case-study-report may depend on the writer 's having provided extensive-detail and description , making unexpected-conclusions as difficult to deny as if the reader had been part of the event . in this respect , the narrative-mode is not a stylistic-choice ; it is inherent in the purpose of case-studies and the nature of their inquiry . it becomes an obstacle only when authors seek publication through outlets whose customers generally ask for brief-details . the traditional-case-study belongs to research , notthe case-study-evaluation . to apply case-study-methods toadapted for evaluation , evaluators have had to adapt what derived evaluation largely from sociological and anthropological page 97 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations fieldwork ( patton , 1980 ) . before 1970 , however , evaluation-case studies were similar to research-case-studies . they were longitudinal , were made by on-site-observers who sought participant-observer-roles , and constituted an inquiry structured from an evolving-understanding of events and their meaning to the persons involved in them . there was usually only one research investigator , and the data consisted of descriptions , observations , impressions , unstructured-interviews , and existing-materials gathered at the site that were organized intuitively and informally . the case-study-report was a narrative whose purpose was to illustrate or portray what a program was like , how it was being implemented , and how those who were part of it both affected it and were affected by it . in these early-uses of the case-study-method , evaluators wrote their reports to stand alone . little-effort was made to integrate two or more sources of data , even when the evaluation-design included them , although simple-references might be made to the number of times a feature of other sites was also characteristic of the site reported in the study . the case-study was useful for readers interested in what a particular-program was like or what happened to a typical-beneficiary . early in the 1970 's when evaluators wanted to design studies that would capture some implementation or outcome-features that were different or expensive to measure reliably on a large scale-for-example , the way a large-organization handled a complex innovation or the effect of an education-program on motivation to learn or growth in self-confidence-they felt caught between risking considerable-effort in trying to quantify qualitative-variables and risking the criticism that they were ignoring really-important things because they could not be measured . the case-study seemed a way out . it page 98 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations the study-questions offered a relatively-inexpensive , low-risk-supplement to the large-scale-collection of other information that could be measured more cheaply and reliably than with large-scale-studies . by and large , investigators commissioned to carry out the early-case-study evaluations had been trained in the academic-disciplines with the strongest fieldwork-traditions , and they had to struggle with the extent to which their research-method could be adapted to evaluation , retain its integrity , and yield positive-benefits . the struggle is not yet fully over . the first adaptation was a shift of the specification of study question from the principal-investigator during the period of study performance to the persons who commissioned the study in advance of data-collection . for example , those who supported an evaluation of a training-program might want the researchers to find out whether the development of the participants ' self-concepts , self-esteem , task-orientation , work-habits , and personal and social-traits seemed associated with the program or with something else . researchers from fieldwork-traditions would have argued that they could provide the most useful-information by spending some time at the site of the training-program , trying to understand what the program meant to those who were involved in it , and reporting on what was happening from the perspective of those who were making it happen . since this might have everything to do what the participants ' chance to socialize with friends in a nonthreatening environment and nothing to do with self-esteem or work-habits , it seemed to these researchers that it was therefore-logical not to decide on the evaluation-questions until their appropriateness could be determined . page 99 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations the compromise that has developed is to include in the evaluation the questions of interest to the customer and to permit the researchers to determine what data-elements are relevant to these questions and from whom and how they should be collected . it allows the evaluator to remain alert to other questions that might prove more salient if allowed to emerge . how satisfactory is the compromise ? the final-reports of some non-gao case-studies show little or no resemblance between the final-questions and those in the approved study-proposal , and a number of issues about this have not been resolved . we do not know whether the discrepancy is more frequent in case-studies than in other methods . it may be that the final-questions are the ones the investigators wanted to look at all along , so that the methodology is vulnerable to subterfuge . possibly the emergent-questions were those that should reasonably have been expected to come into focus-and whose emergence may be why case-studies rather than surveys are used . from the perspective of the authenticity and integrity of results , the larger public-interest may have been served . if the method is highly-susceptible to this kind of internal-change , the appropriate-scope for case-studies should be examined . when the case-study involves one site and modest-expense , the price for identifying better questions early may seem affordable . this is not to say that all case-study-evaluations show divergence between the questions that were asked and those that were answered or that an appropriate-balance between the evaluator 's and the customer 's needs is never reached . however , applying the case-study-methods of research to evaluation requires dealing with matters of control , power , and responsibility that were less visible in the work of page 100 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations the number of sites academic-researchers before their methods were adapted to evaluation . the demands of evaluation led to other adjustments in ethnographic-methods . one such demand was that a method developed for understanding the particular had to be modified for learning about the general . another was the need for something more adequate than `` naturalistic-generalization '' for evaluation-purposes . a third was the problem of site-variation , which in the mid-1970 's was identified in quantitative-studies as an ill-understood-source of greater differences in a program 's outcomes than the program itself . the case-study-method seemed born to help , but the forces of time and cost associated with making multisite-evaluations led to considerable-adaptation . first , since evaluators often needed simultaneous-study at several-sites , they needed several-observers , which created-issues of coordination and interpretation . second , the cost of maintaining a trained full-time field worker at a site runs high , so that evaluators had to settle for shorter observations or untrained-field-workers or both . all these changes-to multiple-observers , professionally supervised but not professionally trained-observers , and shorter observation times-led to others . the across-sites-data-base got much larger as the number of sites in a study rose . the within-sites-data-bases became less extensive as observation-times were shortened . it became a challenge to integrate the work of different-observers if they focused their attention on different topics from site to site . and this much larger , much less extensive , probably less reliable-data-base had to be analyzed and reported in a much shorter time than that of fairly page 101 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations leisurely academic-research . not surprisingly , analysis has become a major methodological-concern , and more structured and perhaps more efficient-approaches to analysis have been developed . to these adaptations , another was added . the case-study was given a purpose-program-evaluation-beyond that of illustration , exploration , or generation of hypotheses . as the examination of program-implementation and program-effectiveness became more central to the case-study , so did the ability to generalize findings . in turn , quantitative-methods in case-studies expanded . quantitative-methods were incorporated in the case-study in two ways . the first was in triangulation : the use of several-forms of data within a single-case-study in order to give many reference points for verifying-patterns and ruling out alternative-explanations in order to achieve what evaluators call `` internal-validity . '' the second was in the combination of case-study-methods with other methods , particularly-surveys , in order to achieve the generalizability that evaluators called `` external-validity . '' these adaptations created the need for a better understanding of the relationship between case-study-techniques and other techniques and between quantitative and qualitative-approaches within case-studies . quantitative-methods summary-table i.2 summarizes the changes that have been made to adapt the research-case-study to evaluators ' needs . adapting the research-case-study to the evaluator 's needs has entailed a number of changes . less time is spent at sites . information is collected by junior-staff working under the supervision of an investigator trained in case-study-methods . more time page 102 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations is allowed for training and monitoring-quality . data are combined from several-sites to allow generalization ; and data-collection has been given greater structure . methods of assessing the reliability of observations , techniques for transforming very large amounts of qualitative-data , and methods for aggregating qualitative-data or findings from several-sites have been developed . the ability to generalize has become a matter of design and analysis . reporting methods have changed . case-studies in evaluation-today have made these adaptations in different-degrees . some studies have not only generalized but also tested hypotheses . some case-studies rely wholly on quantitative-data . some rely wholly on information collected by others , not trained as sociologists or anthropologists , rather than on firsthand-observation . some aim for uniformity or comparability of data both within a site with multiple-observers and across several-sites . some use inferential-statistics as well as descriptive-statistics . some present-findings and conclusions in forms closely resembling those of other methods . these adaptations are not uniformly valued . some case-study methodologists work with structured-evaluation-questions , structured-data-collection , and observers untrained as anthropologists or sociologists , but they believe that case-studies offer a qualitative way of knowing that should not be merged with quantitative-results . others believe that case-studies can not be used for making the kind of generalizations that probabilistic models are used for , so that little is to be gained and so much is to be lost from increasing the number of sites . still others believe in using many sites in case-studies for evaluations and see the next-step as establishing more explicit-procedures for analyzing-data and reviewing-quality . `` case-study '' means different-things to different-methodologists , who reach different-conclusions about how to do case-studies , how to report them , and their overall-appro-priateness for answering a specific-question . if case-studies can vary so greatly , how can we assess their usefulness for evaluation ? one way is to develop a working-definition of the case-study that embodies its essential methodological-features and then to examine the strengths and limitations of case-studies for different-evaluation-questions . this is the approach taken in this paper in developing our initial definition . appendix ii site-selection example question 1 : instance-selection imagine that in 1987 , within an effort to estimate the extent of tax-revenues lost or delayed from the failure of businesses to file returns , the general-accounting-office examined-revenue-shortfalls to individual-states . imagine we found 170,076 such instances ( a national-projection based on a sample ) and estimated that , cumulatively , over $ 500 million was lost to the states . our report attracted much congressional-interest . variation among states in the rate of such `` missing-returns '' was of particular-concern . imagine we now have been asked to examine in more detail what explains differences among states in `` missing-returns , '' since cumulatively the effect is to make states look poorer than they actually would be if they collected-revenues authorized by their own legislatures . ( hypothetical-data for this example are given in table 2.2 . ) using the hypothetical-data in table ii.i , identify states for each type of purposive-selection that we might consider . bracketing best case worst case cluster representative typical special-interest table ii.i : hypothetical-data on unfiled state number unfiled-rate unfiled corporate-income tax alabama 6,100 5 returns for 1986

corporate-tax returns . might form one pair ; kansas and arizona a second pair . best case three states have missing-returns ( unfiled ) rates of less than 1 percent . these are hawaii , kansas , and new york . hawaii and kansas are relatively-small states and new york has implemented a special-initiative . adding-states with 1 percent unfiled-rates to the pool would not add larger states , however , since these are iowa , maine , montana , north dakota , and south dakota . it may be that the correlation between `` smaller '' states and very low-rates of unfiled-returns is a `` real '' phenomenon that should be examined and the initial-cut of less than 1 percent should stand . worst case texas is an outlier , with a 15-percent unfiled-rate . north carolina has a 10-percent rate , arkansas 9 percent . the next closest states are ohio and oklahoma , with 6 percent each . selecting texas , north carolina , and arkansas would be a reasonable worst-case-choice . cluster except for new york , no information is given about programs or state-initiatives . using only the data in the table , several-bases for clustering could be considered . one frequently used basis is `` size of the problem '' : that is , 7 states account for about 45 percent of all unfiled-returns ( california , florida , illinois , new york , oklahoma , pennsylvania , and texas ) . this basis for selection should be ruled out for this job , however , because there is no meaningful-cluster from the group , except that the states are all among the larger states . the rationale for the job is bolstering each individual-state 's revenue , not the national pooled-aggregrate . since there are more smaller , semirural-states than big-states , the well-being of individual-states would not necessarily be best served by examining what happens in the few larger states . another basis might be a page 109 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations crosstabulation of state-size and rate of unfiled-returns ; here selection of six states could give a reasonable-fix on reasons for the problem but would essentially reproduce the strategy used in the representative-sample . we would conclude that the data in the table are not sufficient for drawing a cluster-sample . representative the distribution of unfiled-rates is positively skewed , which means that instances are piled up at the low-end and scattered out over the high end . with such a distribution , '' representative '' in terms of unfiled-rates would sensibly mean at the low ( 1 and less than 1 percent ) , lower middle ( 2 and 3 percent ) , upper-middle ( 4 , 5 , and 6 percent ) , and high ( 9 , 10 , and 15 percent ) points . assuming-state-size would be a `` second cut '' variable , new york ( 1 percent ) , california ( 3 percent ) , ohio ( 6 percent ) , and texas ( 15 percent ) could be one group to study , while kansas ( less than 1 percent ) , massachusetts , ( 2 percent ) , oklahoma ( 6 percent ) , and arizona ( 9 percent ) could form a second group of smaller states . together , the eight states also would provide reasonable geographic-representativeness , as well as industrialized versus more rural-spreads . typical a frequency-distribution of unfiled-rates shows that 14 states had rates of 3 , which turns out to be both the mode and the median for this distribution . states in this category include california , connecticut , illinois , indiana , kentucky , maryland , michigan , missouri , new jersey , new mexico , oregon , rhode island , west virginia , and wyoming . with no other information ( for the purpose of this exercise ) , if fewer than 14-case-studies were to be made , selecting-states typical in size such as maryland , michigan , new jersey , and indiana would make sense . special-interest new york would be of special-interest as a large-state with a very low-rate of unfiled-returns . new york also is unique in implementing relevant-legislation that might have some national-potential . while it might be possible , given the data in table ii.1 , question 2 to select states on six of the seven purposive-bases , would the evaluation-question itself present a situation in which we would want to consider case-studies at all ? answer yes , but not as a stand-alone-method . we have been asked to examine the reasons for state-variation in unfiled-returns . one plausible-reason is that the differences are the result of how states solicit returns , monitor compliance , and penalize-failure to file . we could obtain tax-codes and procedures for each state , examine these , interview selected officials , and generate some plausible-patterns . however , understanding-reasons for behavior as complex as not filing is well suited for case-studies . explanations could range from ( for example ) failures of managing-returns actually filed , which are quite-susceptible to improvement , to economic-cycles that affect business-circumstances and that may be less susceptible to change . since the underlying-concern is that many states may be asking for federal-assistance when they would have resources to handle more of their own needs if they collected-revenues owing to them , case-studies of a representative-sample of states coupled with examination of the special-interest-state could be an efficient-strategy for ensuring that we had a comprehensive-understanding of what was happening and why . to provide the generalization desirable , the case-studies could be followed by a national-survey of state officials , checking out the findings from the in-depth-studies . such a sequence could be quite page 111 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations efficient , since the national-survey would not be a fishing expedition but targeted to verify initial-findings . it also would offer considerable-assurance that we had accurately determined reasons affecting most states . appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports there are at least six different types of case-study-application in evaluation , and their strengths and limitations are different . choosing an appropriate-method depends on understanding the evaluation-question . what is technically-right for one question is not necessarily-right for another . however , there are standards that can be applied to all case-studies in evaluation . studies that fail to meet them have questionable-merit . these quidelines present the minimum-standard of quality in case-study-evaluation , taken in conjunction with the guidance in the `` yellow-book , '' policy manual , and communications manual . 1 . are the evaluation-questions stated clearly and design explicitly ? a good-study informs the reader early in the report about the questions that were answered and the issues that were investigated . 2 . is the case-study-application clearly described ? is it appropriate ? a good-case-study describes the case-study-application that was used . it explains why this application is appropriate for the kind of evaluation-questions that were answered ( descriptive , normative , cause-and-effect ) . where several-methods were used , the relationship of the case-study to the other methods is clear and appropriate . 3 . was the time-span of the study long enough to address the core-issues fairly ? a good-case-study reports how much time the investigation covered in relation to the history of the instance or program . case-studies aiming at a comprehensive-analysis of an event as a whole begin as early as possible in its 1these-guidelines have been adapted from `` guidelines for reporting large case-studies '' by john r. gilbert in david c. hoaglin et al. , data for decisions : information-strategies for decisionmakers ( cambridge , mass . : abt books , 1982 ) , pp . 138-39 , and robert k. yin , case-study research : design and methods ( beverly hills , calif. : sage , 1984 ) , pp . 140-45 . appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports history and continue through its completion or stabilization . evaluation-case studies have covered shorter periods and involved less on-site-investigation than research-case-studies characteristically do . readers should recognize , however , that as time shortens , so may the value of the method as a way of presenting a comprehensive-understanding of the event as a whole . 4 . is the basis for case-selection presented ? is it appropriate for the purpose of the case-study ? a good-case-study presents the reasons for selecting the instances that were examined . the reasons are appropriate for the case-study-application , an issue of particular-concern if a generalization of the findings is intended . for assessing the study 's adequacy , the kind of site selected is as important as the number of sites selected . attention should be paid to the physical-setting , to the people who are served by the program , and to variations in treatment . 1 . are the methods of data-collection presented ? are data-collection they appropriate for the purpose of the case-study ? unstructured-methods may be appropriate for illustrative and exploratory-applications . semistructured-approaches may be appropriate for critical-instance-case studies involving-multiple sites , particularly if more than one investigator was responsible for collecting-data for several-sites . 2 . if more than one investigator collected the data , how were the other evaluators selected , trained , and supervised ? there is considerable-agreement that the consequence of the many variants in data-collection for multiple-sites is uncertain , but providing detailed-information on the procedures that are used and an explanation of the reasons for the approach are essential to a good-case-study . page 114 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports data-base formation and data-analysis-techniques 3 . are information-sources described clearly and fully ? are they appropriate ? a good-case-study presents in detail the sources of evidence . the detail is greater than that required in other methods . a good-case-study report gives the numbers and positions of the persons interviewed and the evidence that they were appropriate for the evaluation . the reader should be able to judge from the information that is given in the case-study-report how credible the conclusions are in terms of the appropriateness and completeness of information-sources . 1 . are the procedures for the formation of the data-base described ? a good-case-study describes how the data-bases were formed and presents a justification for decisions that were made about the qualification , precision , and detail of information in the data-base at each site . 2 . are the techniques of data-gathering and data-processing explicitly described ? readers of a good-case-study should know how the data were collected and , step by step , how they were analyzed . if semistructured-packets of directions were used to guide field-workers through the issues , a good-case-study describes them or includes them in technical appendixes . all the steps of data-reduction and coding are described , along with the basis for transformations in these steps . the analytic-techniques are explicitly described . what data-sources were used in triangulation ? in what order ? how were discrepant findings resolved ? the validity of case-study-methods partly depends on the resolution-process . at each step , safeguards should have been taken for completeness and the reduction of the threat of bias . appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports 3 . were there interpretation-differences , and if so how were they resolved ? a good-case-study is explicit about differences in the interpretation of evidence and events between members of the investigative-team and the reviewers of the draft-report . the case-study-method often uses data that are more judgmental , interpretive , and subjective than other methods . the data are often less accessible to secondary-analysis . thus , a good-case-study states the argument and evidence more plainly than most reports have to . 4 . if other studies , investigations , or experiments relevant to the issue are available , have their results been presented and reconciled with the case-study findings ? a good-case-study presents the findings and conclusions for other studies on the same issue . when the findings do not converge , the case-study-reconciles or explains the differences as far as possible . completeness of information requires this step . 1 . are methodological-strengths and limitations reporting identified clearly ? a good-case-study reports methodological-strengths and limitations for answering the evaluation-questions and explains the tradeoffs that were considered and who influenced the decisions . when several decisionmakers were involved , a good-case-study describes the types of decisions each one made and the constraints on those decisions . 2 . are the arguments for various-resolutions of the evaluation-question presented ? most case-studies are on topics about which some kind of opinion has been formed . in a good-case-study , the conceptual-framework for organizing the inquiry is quite-explicit about expectations . a good-case-study identifies the page 116 gao/pemd-91-10.1.9 case-study-evaluations appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports impartiality and generalizability elements of the issue that was examined and presents the initial-arguments in favor of the various-resolutions and the findings of the study that support these resolutions . 3 . are the arguments against various-resolutions of the issue presented ? a good-case-study presents the initial-arguments against the various-resolutions of the issue that was considered . case-study-investigators are supposed to seek evidence that confirms and evidence that contradicts the observations and conclusions . explicitly stating the initial-arguments for and against various-resolutions helps readers know how thoroughly the investigators considered the issues and how thoroughly they sought evidence on both sides . 4 . does the case-study identify the factors explaining the phenomena that were observed and state clearly whether the identification of these factors was based on insight and recognition or on quantitative techniques ? case-studies are undertaken for their explanatory power and their superior-ability to identify the reasons for problems and the nature of events . a good-case-study explicitly identifies alternative-explanations , lays out the chain of reasoning , and makes clear which conclusions rest primarily on the investigators ' insightful-recognition of patterns of evidence and which have been recognized in other ways . 1 . what is known about the competence and impartiality of the investigators ? a good-case-study provides information about the experience of the investigators with case-study-methods and what they have written previously about the questions that were answered . the more evidence there is that the investigators have had appropriate-training in case appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports study-methods , and that they have addressed related-issues in ways that seem impartial and are intended to reduce bias , the greater confidence the reader can have in the quality of the work . for gao reports , the job-documentation should contain evidence that the evaluation-team as a group possessed the skills required and assurance that there were no impediments to impartiality among individual-team-members . for others ' reports we plan to use in our studies , we should seek similar-assurance in a report itself or from knowledgable-persons . 2 . are comments on the draft-report available ? perhaps because case-studies require more detail than other methods , case-study-reports are sometimes criticized for failing to be convincing about their impartiality . one way that a good-case-study counters this criticism is by the inclusion of a technical appendix that gives the full-comments of the informants who reviewed the draft . 3 . is there adequate-information for judging-generalizability ? the basis for claiming-generalizability is explicit in a good-case-study . it provides the evidence , of whatever type and detail , that is needed for assessing this claim . in a good-case-study , generalizations do not exceed the basis for these , considering-program-diversity and how the cases-studies were selected . we provide a checklist of the guidelines discussed in this appendix in table iii.1 appendix iii guidelines for reviewing-case-study reports table iii.1 : checklist for reviewing-case-study reports design 1 . are the evaluation-questions stated clearly andexplicitly ? 2 . is the case-study-application clearly
