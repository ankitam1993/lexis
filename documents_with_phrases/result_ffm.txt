current federal frequent-traveler policy under current federal-laws and regulations , the frequent-traveler benefits1 received by a federal-employee in conjunction with official-travel are generally considered government-property , and the employee may not retain the benefits for personal-use . as a result , the employee should accept the benefits on behalf of the government and turn them over to the employee 's agency . the agency should then integrate the benefits into its travel-plans to maximize their value to the government . initially , this policy was enunciated and followed in a number of prior comptroller general decisions . these decisions were based on the fundamental-rule of law that a federal-employee is obligated to account for any gift , gratuity , or benefit received from private-sources incident to the performance of official-duty . any such gifts , gratuities , or benefits tendered to the employee are viewed as having been received on behalf of the government.2 in 1994 , congress enacted a statute designed to help realize to the maximum-extent practicable-cost-savings for official-travel from frequent-traveler-benefits . the statute directed the administrator of gsa to issue guidelines to ensure that agencies promote , encourage , and facilitate the use of frequent-traveler-programs offered by airlines , hotels , and car rental-vendors by federal-employees who engage in official travel.3 this act specifically provides that any awards granted under such a frequent-traveler-program accrued through official-travel shall be used only for official travel.4 gsa has incorporated these policies into the federal property management regulations5 and the federal travel regulation,6 applicable to most federal civilian-employees . similarly , the joint federal travel regulations,7 applicable to members of 1 these include the benefits offered by airlines , hotels , and car rental-vendors . 2 see 67 comp . gen. 79 ( 1987 ) ( quoting b-199656 , july 15 , 1981

103-355 , § 6008 and reminding them of the existing-provisions of the federal travel regulation concerning-cost-saving-opportunities provided by the use of frequent-traveler-benefits . in bulletin ftr 17 , gsa also encouraged-agencies to establish programs under the government-employees incentive-awards act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 4501-4507 , to reward employees who take the initiative to accrue travel-savings , and gsa offered its program as a guide in establishing such reward programs . 541 c.f.r . § 101-25.103-2 . 6 41 c.f.r . part 301-53 . 7 paragraph u2010b . the uniformed-services , recognize that promotional-material received by a uniformed-service-member traveling on official business at government-expense belongs to the government and must be relinquished in accordance with service regulations.8 legislation would be required to change the government 's general policy to allow civilian-employees and uniformed-service-members to retain for personal-use frequent-traveler-benefits accrued on official-travel . such legislation would be necessary to repeal the current-requirement that such benefits be used only for official travel9 and to affirmatively authorize employees and members to retain for personal-use these benefits that are now considered the property of the government . use of frequent-flyer-miles for official-travel is difficult and appears limited comprehensive-governmentwide-data are not readily-available on the extent to which federal-agencies capture and use frequent-flyer-miles for official-travel . gsa officials told us that they do not collect such data . however , our task-team did obtain information on gao 's practices , as well as those of several other federal-organizations . this information follows . gao 's experience gao has never had a centralized , formal-program to reduce its travel-costs by capturing and using its employees ' official-travel-miles . several years ago , we pilottested a program in one of our headquarters-units but soon discontinued it for a variety of reasons . these reasons , which have also discouraged other headquarters-units , include the airlines ' refusal to establish separate-official and personal-travel accounts for employees , employees ' reluctance to participate , administrative-burdens and costs , and limited-savings . furthermore , few frequent-flyer-seats were available at desired travel-times , transfers of free-tickets to other employees took-time and effort , and employees who flew on different-airlines often took a long time to accumulate enough-miles for free-trips . although we never set up a gao-wide-program to capture and use frequent-flyer-miles , several of our field-offices tried to establish such programs . of these , the majority discontinued their efforts for the same reasons that discouraged our headquarters-units . two field-offices did , however , establish programs and continue to operate them , yet their dollar-savings have been very limited . one office saved $ 6,600 over about 33 months . this office has many employees with enough-miles on single-carriers for free-trips , but these miles have been difficult to use because few seats have been available when employees have needed to travel . furthermore , in past-years , the unit 's savings were reduced by the $ 50 fee that the contract-carrier charged for reservations made less than 3 weeks in advance . accumulating sufficient 8 there are some federal-organizations that are not covered by § 6008 of p.l . 103-355 and also have their own property-disposal authority . one such organization we are aware of that does not prohibit its employees from retaining frequent-flyer-benefits for their personal-use is the u.s . postal-service . 9 § 6008 of p.l . 103-355. frequent-flyer-miles for this unit 's employees has become more problematic since the government contracted with a different carrier for one of the unit 's most heavily traveled routes . the other field-office , which reported saving about $ 32,000 over 6 years , also noted that multiple-changes in contract-carriers have made it more difficult to accumulate and effectively use frequent-flyer-miles . experiences of other federal-organizations the other federal-organizations we contacted had varied approaches to capturing and using frequent-flyer-benefits for official-travel . a representative from one -- the u.s . postal-service , which is not subject to the travel-rules that apply to most federal-agencies -- said that the service does not prohibit its employees from making personal-use of the frequent-flyer-miles received on official-travel . in 1998 , the department of the interior considered establishing a frequent-traveler-program that would have been managed by a contractor . however , the department rejected the contractor's proposal as too expensive and difficult to implement . interior believed that the fees the contractor would have charged were excessive and the savings were uncertain . in addition , under the contractor 's proposal , interior would have had to provide the contractor with data on the frequent-flyer-miles received by its employees . it would have had to obtain the data from the employees because the airlines would not provide the information to the agency . an interior department representative told us that some of its bureaus use frequent-flyer-benefits to enable their employees to take training and attend conferences because their budgets do not cover non-program-related-travel . therefore , if frequent-flyer-miles received on program-related-travel were not captured and used for this type of travel , the bureaus might not be able to send their employees to these types of events . at the same time , if employees were allowed to retain the frequent-flyer-benefits , they might be willing to use some of their miles for such travel on a voluntary-basis . gsa , irs , and the department of justice have established gain-sharing-programs that enable frequent-travelers to share in the savings they achieve in airfares , lodging-costs , or both . under these programs , employees can obtain cash-awards based on savings they can document by using free-tickets from airline frequent-flyer-programs or by securing-lodging-rates below the maximum-amounts allowed . according to gsa officials , gsa considered establishing a frequent-traveler-program in the early-1990s but abandoned the idea because the airlines would neither pool the miles received by gsa employees for the agency 's use nor provide data to gsa on the miles its employees received . in 1995 , however , gsa established a voluntary gainsharing-program under which employees who use free-tickets awarded for official-travel-miles or secure-lodging at less than the established-lodging-rates can receive cash-awards of up to half the amount saved for the government . gsa reported that from january 1995 through september 2000 , almost $ 823,000 was saved under the program , and employees received about half that amount in cash-awards . these savings do not take into account the costs of administering the gain-sharing-program , which gsa officials believe were minimal . however , gsa officials view the program as a limited success because the savings are low-relative to gsa 's overall travel-costs , which totaled about $ 190 million for the last 6 years . in addition , gsa officials believe that most of the savings are from the lodging-portion of the program rather than from the use of frequent-flyer-miles . irs established a program similar to gsa 's in 2000 at the request of the national treasury employees union . employees can accrue-savings by such means as using frequent-flyer-miles to obtain free-airline-tickets , sharing-hotel-rooms with coworkers , or staying with friends or relatives . irs travel-officials did not have data on the savings achieved through their program because the program is less than a year old . however , they view the program as a success . they said employees like the program and most of the savings are in lodging-costs . the justice department established its gain-sharing-program at the beginning of fiscal year 1996 . like gsa and irs , justice shares savings its employees achieve by using frequent-flyer-miles and obtaining-lodging at reduced-costs . the program is discretionary , and justice components can choose whether they want to include frequent-flyer-savings , lodging-savings , or both . administrative-support staff who assist travelers who achieve savings can also share in the savings-awards . according to justice , it saved about $ 70,000 in fiscal year 1996 and $ 202,000 in fiscal year 1997 and paid cash-awards equaling about half of the savings . again , these financial-benefits do not factor in the gain-sharing program's administrative-costs . justice did not provide savings-data beyond fiscal year 1997 . according to a representative from dod , the department does not have a departmentwide frequent-traveler-program and has no data on the extent to which its components have such programs . he said that in the mid-1990s , his command attempted to , but could not , find an effective-program for capturing and using-employees ' official frequent-flyer-miles anywhere in dod . he believes the use of free-tickets awarded for frequent-flyer-miles in dod is spotty at best . he cited many of the same practical-difficulties with implementing the current federal-policy that we and other agencies identified , including the reluctance of both the airlines and employees to provide frequent-flyer-data to the government and the problems with tracking and using-miles for official-travel . he also identified another difficulty -- the time and expense associated with taking disciplinary-action against employees who violate the current-policy by making personal-use of miles received on official-travel . he said his agency completed a demotion-action against an employee for personal-use of miles , but assistance from the airlines was difficult to obtain . such action , he maintained , was not cost-effective . these difficulties , combined with a departmental emphasis on adopting-private-sector-practices , have led dod to prepare draft-legislation that would abolish the current restriction and allow military and civilian-employees governmentwide to retain for personal-use frequent-flyer-benefits received on official-travel . he said that dod has discussed its proposal with other federal-agencies , which have been supportive . dod is currently considering submitting its proposal to the office of management and budget . an sec representative informed us that sec began using a contractor 's software 2 to 3 years ago to facilitate the use of frequent-flyer-mileage . she said that employees ' participation in sec 's frequent-flyer-program is voluntary and that sec 's savings have been minimal , in part because frequent-flyer-tickets do not give travelers-flexibility in arranging their travel . specifically , she said that it is difficult for sec employees to obtain seating using frequent-flyer-tickets because many trips are scheduled , canceled , or changed at the last-minute . finally , she said that sec is likely to discontinue its contract because the savings , minus the contractor 's 30-percent commission , are not sufficient to offset sec 's `` hidden '' management and oversight-costs and employees have not been enthusiastic about participating in the program . the private sector 's practices according to the results of three recent-surveys , the private sector commonly allows its employees to retain for personal-use frequent-flyer-miles received on business-travel . this practice may give the private sector , including-government-contractors , an advantage over the federal government in recruiting and retaining-employees . while small compared with the higher salaries-companies often pay , this advantage may nonetheless influence the job-choices of some employees , especially if they are frequent-travelers . in april 2001 , the national business-travel association surveyed its members via the internet on frequent-traveler-programs . according to the association , 200 companies responded . of these , 98 percent said they do not recover frequent-traveler-benefits received by employees on business-travel for their companies , and 95 percent said they have no plans to do so . according to the association , most companies do not want to become involved in capturing these benefits because it is too difficult to track miles or points received . in may 2000 , the bureau of national affairs reported the results of a 1999 survey of about 1,800 companies on their business-travel policies . these companies , about 450 of which responded to the survey , represented a cross-section of u.s. employers : 34 percent were manufacturing-companies , 36 percent were nonmanufacturing ( e.g. , service ) businesses , and about 30 percent were other establishments , such as health-care-facilities , educational-institutions , and government agencies . seventy percent of the companies had fewer than 1,000 employees , and the remainder had more . according to the survey , most employers with business travelers allowed their workers to keep frequent-flyer-miles received on business-travel for their own use . about two-thirds of the responding-companies reported specifically allowing their employees to retain the miles for their personal-use , about 20 percent reported having no policy at all , and under 10 percent reported requiring their employees to relinquish-mileage received to the company . a few companies reported having gain-sharing-programs similar to gsa 's , irs ' , and justice 's . the findings from these two surveys appear consistent with the results of an american express survey of business-travel management , reported in july 1999 by business-travel news , a business-travel industry publication . according to the article discussing this survey , the trend in the private sector was away from collecting frequent-flyer-awards , and the number of corporations doing so was declining . specifically , the survey showed that the proportion of companies managing and using frequent-flyer-miles received by their travelers fell from 9 percent in 1994 to 4 percent in 1996 . according to the article , `` most companies neither want the headache of tracking-miles nor the disincentive that taking them away might present to employees . '' in addition , the article discussed the views of the travel-services-manager of a company that was using a contractor to aggressively track and use frequent-flyer-miles for company-business . although this approach was saving the company 10 percent of its overall air-travel costs , the manager said he would rather receive discounts from the airlines than deal with frequent-flyer-miles . these survey-results are also consistent with the experience of one large-corporation that we contacted in 1994 after learning that it had established a program to capture and use for company-travel frequent-flyer-miles received by employees on company-business . the company later told us that it had discontinued the program because of its adverse-effect on employee-morale . in april 2001 , we contacted the company again , and a representative told us that the company continues to allow its employees to make personal-use of frequent-flyer-miles received on company-travel . views on frequent-flyer-issue you asked for our views on this issue as well as those of the foreign service-officers association . i will discuss the association 's views first . in april 2001 , the director of congressional affairs for the foreign service-officers association told us that the association would support legislation that would allow federal-employees to keep for personal-use frequent-flyer-miles earned on official-travel . he said the association recognizes that many foreign service-officers frequently travel long distances and would therefore receive considerable-benefits from such legislation . however , he noted that these officers are often assigned to hardship-locations that require difficult-travel . he also said that if this type of legislation is not feasible , the association's members would like to be able to use their frequent-flyer-miles to upgrade to business-class on long flights . in our view , the current federal-policy on frequent-flyer-miles was well intentioned as a potential-means for reducing federal travel-costs and promoting-economy in government . we recognize that federal-agencies , including gao , might be able to achieve some additional-savings by taking more advantage of frequent-flyer-miles for government-travel . however , the practical-obstacles to achieving significantly greater savings are such that few agencies have overcome them without creating-incentives , such as gain-sharing-plans , that have generally reduced the government's savings by half . additionally , more aggressive-efforts to use frequent-flyer-miles to reduce the government 's travel-costs could , according to gsa , jeopardize its ability to negotiate significant-savings under its contract air carrier program . this negotiated travel-program saves the government over $ 2 billion annually . gsa officials responsible for the program told us they believe the savings achieved through this program far outweigh the benefits the government would gain through more aggressive-efforts to capture and use frequent-flyer-miles for official-travel . we do not know how a change in the current federal-policy to permit individual-use would affect gsa 's ability to negotiate savings in contract airfares . however , a change would not seem likely to have a negative impact , since , in contrast to the current-policy , it would be consistent with the airlines ' position that frequent-flyer-miles belong to the individual-traveler . changing the federal-policy on frequent-flyer-miles would have some disadvantages for the government . first , it would eliminate any savings that certain-agencies currently achieve by implementing the policy . in addition , some employees who now travel on free-tickets obtained with frequent-flyer-miles might no longer be able to travel when funds for air-travel were not available or were in short-supply . however , these disadvantages would , we believe , be far outweighed by the advantages of a change , both to federal-employees and to the government . a change would eliminate the current-disparity in practice between the private sector and the government and would put federal-employees on a par with their private-sector-counterparts , including federal-contractor personnel , in this area . like private-sector-employees , federal-employees who put up with flight-delays and cancellations and travel on their own time to meet work-schedules would then feel that they were being compensated , in part , for these frustrations and sacrifices . establishing-parity between the federal government and the private sector in this area would also aid the government in recruiting and retaining-top-quality-employees . if the current-policy is changed to allow federal civilian and military-employees to retain their official-travel-miles for personal-use , controls over the need for travel and the selection of routes and carriers would have to be effectively implemented . these controls are designed to prevent employees from selecting certain-carriers to earn miles or otherwise undercutting the government 's negotiated fare-agreements with major-carriers . today , millions of frequent-flyer-miles earned on official-travel are going unused , benefiting neither the government nor its employees . changing the federal frequent-flyer-policy-and changing it retroactively so that employees can take advantage of these unused-miles -- would boost federal-employees ' morale and strengthen the federal government 's ability to compete with the private sector . we therefore believe congress should consider allowing federal-employees to keep and make personal-use of the frequent-flyer-miles they have already received and will receive for official-travel . in order to assist the committee , we have enclosed draft-legislation that would accomplish this objective ( see enc . i ) . if you have any questions
