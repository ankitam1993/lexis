new york law journal tuesday , april 9 , 2002 city council budget targets legal-work by daniel wise the new york city council yesterday offered a radically different-set of priorities for the handling of the city 's legal-work in its response to mayor bloomberg 's plan to close a projected $ 4.8 billion-budget-deficit . the city council plan would increase by nearly 50 percent - to $ 80.4 million - the amount of funding mayor bloomberg proposed for the legal-aid society by sharply curtailing-compensation for court-appointed-lawyers under the 18-b program . the city council plan would also reduce to 2 percent the bloomberg plan 's 7-percent-cut for district-attorney 's offices citywide . the city council 's proposal for the 650-lawyer corporation counsel 's office would slash its budget by 10 percent - or $ 10.2 million - to $ 92 million . in contrast , mayor bloomberg 's budget plan called for a modest 3.8 percent in the corporation counsel's budget , leaving the office relatively untouched in comparison to most other mayoral-agencies . council aides said yesterday that they did not have a head-count for the cuts at the law department , but that the city council plan is tilted towards the elimination of legal-positions , which at 10 percent would require the layoff of more than 65 lawyers . at the same time , the city council plan envisages dramatic-cuts in the legal-departments of many city-agencies with a view to transferring the work to the law department . the plan also calls for the elimination of the mayor 's office of contracts , which would save $ 1.8 million , and the transfer of the legal-work done by that agency to the corporation counsel 's office . council aides did not have a total for the savings that would be realized in city-agency legal-departments through its plan . but , they said , the proposal would save $ 10 million by eliminating more than 300 lawyers at the administration for children 's services , many of whom prosecute-neglect and abuse-cases in family-court . jack deacy , a spokesman for administration for children's services , was unavailable for comment . council aides also identified steep-cuts in the legal-departments of other agencies : all 40 lawyers at the department of correction for a savings of $ 2 million ; 21 of 28 lawyers at the department of sanitation , saving $ 945,000 ; and seven of 10 lawyers at the department of buildings , $ 451,000 in savings . asked how the corporation counsel 's office could take on the expanded work while its own legal-staff was being cut , thomas l. mcmahon , the general counsel of the city council , said that in view of the city 's `` terribly-difficult fiscal-circumstances , '' the city council plan provides a better way of `` managing the city 's work-force given the resources we have . '' kate ahlers , a spokeswoman for corporation counsel 's office , said that her office had not yet received the city council 's plan and could not comment . the administrative-savings proposed by the city council through the elimination of the office of contracts and many agency legal-positions were part of $ 559 million the council proposed to save through `` consolidation and efficiency '' in management . in total , the city council proposed realizing $ 1.65 billion through savings and increased-fees , including-restoration of the commuter-tax , to fund its own initiatives and offset some of the cuts proposed by mayor bloomberg in his preliminary-budget on feb. 13 . legal-aid would gain one of the most dramatic-changes in priorities proposed by the city council would shift $ 25.6 million from funding for court-appointed-lawyers to the legal-aid society . in a document released yesterday to justify its reordered-priorities , the council contended that legal-aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to article 18-b of the county law . the council document also noted that `` inexplicably '' 18-b lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal-cases in new york city , even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant cases where the legal-aid society had a conflict . in past-years , the city council had consistently added $ 5.6 million to the $ 54.7 million proposed for the legal-aid society by former mayor giuliani , bringing the total to just a shade over $ 60 million . but this year for the first time , the council is proposing shifting more than $ 20 million in funds earmarked by the mayor for 18-b lawyers to the legal-aid society , which would increase its total-funding to $ 80.4 million . that would reflect a jump in its current-finding of about one-third . meantime , the city council proposed slashing the mayor's allocation of $ 62.8 million for 18-b lawyers by 66 percent , to $ 21.4 million . will consider proposal city criminal-justice coordinator john feinblatt expressed a willingness to look at the council 's proposal . `` in tough economic-times , '' he said , `` we are willing to look at any proposal to reallocate scarce-resources . '' the council would restore - and slightly increase - funding for two agencies that handle legal-work for indigent criminal-defendants that mayor bloomberg proposed to eliminate in his preliminary-budget . the council would allocate $ 4 million to neighborhood legal-services , which is based in harlem , and $ 1.8 million to the office of the appellate-defender , which handles appeals for indigent criminal-defendants in the first department . the council proposal would tamp down the 7-percent-cut that mayor bloomberg proposed for the city 's five district-attorneys to 2 percent . the mayor had estimated that a cut of 7 percent would reduce city-spending for its district-attorneys from $ 231 million to $ 215 million , for a savings of $ 16 million . the council 's documents did not itemize the savings projected at the 2-percent-level , but using the mayor 's figures , a 2-percent-cut would result in budget for prosecutors of $ 226.4 million and a savings of $ 4.6 million . the council budget would also restore $ 7.4 million in city funding for civil legal-services-work done by the legal-aid society and legal-services for new york city , which the mayor had proposed cutting .
