the courier-journal saturday , january 23 , 2002 anthem-payout poses problem for some poorest policyholders could lose medicaid , other benefits it might have seemed like manna from heaven - up to thousands of dollars dropping , often unexpectedly , into the hands of a half-million kentucky and indiana residents this month . but for some recipients , there is a downside to the checks from anthem inc. , issued to policyholders as part of the insurer's conversion to a publicly traded company . the poorest recipients could actually suffer from the windfall by losing their benefits under medicaid , food-stamp and other programs . that 's because they suddenly have more money than the eligibility-threshold for aid . to avoid losing valuable-benefits such as a medicaid-paid-spot in a nursing-home , recipients may need to spend their money fast - as early as the end of this month - but make sure they do it in a way that meets program-guidelines . `` you would think money out of the blue would be a good thing , '' said jaime odle harmon , executive director of the lexington-based access to justice foundation . `` we 're just trying to make sure that it is , and does n't have a negative impact on low-income-folks and their families . '' legal-aid-lawyers in kentucky have put together an action-team and held frequent statewide-conference-calls in response to concerns from aid-recipients and advocates that the anthem-payouts could cost people their benefits , at least temporarily . `` we 're getting deluged '' with calls on the issue , said hamon , whose agency supports the state 's legal-services-programs and operates a legal-hotline for the elderly . the basic-advice is this : if you received a check or stock from anthem and you have n't disposed of it yet , pick up the phone and call a legal-aid-lawyer , benefits-counselor or someone else who understands eligibility-guidelines . and do it right away . `` there are people out there who are available to help anyone who has a problem . it 's legal-service and it 's free , '' said amy turner , a staff-attorney in louisville with the legal-aid society , which covers jefferson and 14 surrounding-counties . the sudden-concern over losing-benefits was triggered by the recent-mailing by anthem , the indianapolis-based-insurer , of about $ 2 billion in checks , plus shares of stock worth a bit more than that , to 1 million eligible-policyholders in four states . about half of those were individuals or employers in kentucky and indiana . the distribution was a result of anthem 's conversion last year from a mutual-company , owned by its policyholders , to a publicly traded company owned by the shareholders . despite earlier mailings from anthem , the checks caught many people by surprise . and while it was generally a nice-surprise , it worried many aid-recipients who fear losing-benefits - especially elderly-residents in medicaid nursing-home-beds . to qualify for medicaid and some other state-administered-aid programs in kentucky , you ca n't have more than $ 2000 in liquid assets on hand . that includes cash and stock . in indiana , the medicaid threshold is even lower , $ 1500 . the anthem-payouts were large enough to put many seniors over those limits . the average-payout was $ 4,400 , and the largest - about $ 22,000 went to people who had been with anthem the longest , presumably-seniors . when the checks started showing up in mailboxes sometime after christmas , many aid-recipients were confused about why they got the windfall - and what to do with it . they were justifiably-concerned , advocates say . `` i think there 's a real-danger that people will lose benefits because they wo n't understand how to handle this ( money ) , '' said glenda harrison , staff-attorney with the northern kentucky legal-aid society in covington . `` in particular , the elderly ( could ) be hurt by this , '' she said . `` we are concerned that they wo n't know , one , what this is going to mean , and then , two , even if they know what it means , wo n't know who to contact to help them through this . '' anthem considered the potential-effect of its payouts on public-aid-benefits before making its distribution , said spokeswoman lauren green-caldwell . but after talking to medicaid officials in the four states involved , the company concluded `` that we are not in a position to provide advice to these people , '' she said . she said the company believes the distribution has `` been a really-good thing '' and was handled fairly . while people wondering how to handle their payout should consult an expert abou their particular-situation , there are some general-guidelines . `` you ca n't give it away , said jess williams , branch-manager for eligibility-policy for kentucky department for medicaid services . he said many people are asking if they can give it to their children to put it in a trust for them . the answer is no . in general , you must receive fair-market-value for whatever you spend it on . that means for example , `` you ca n't pay your son $ 10,000 for a car that is worth $ 2000 , '' said lee richardson , a louisville attorney specializing in elder law . the good news , for those who must spend up to $ 22,000 in a few days , is that there is a fairly broad-latitude in what you can spend the money on . kentucky advocates and medicaid officials suggest such alternatives as buying a prepaid-burial , paying premiums in advance on medicare supplement-health-insurance-policy or paying outstanding medical-bills . other allowable-expenditures could include buying a car for medical-transportation-needs , making home-repairs or paying-property-taxes . the main-requirement is , you must get value for your money . otherwise , when you report spending to medicaid - as is required - official could treat the money as unspent , which could affect your benefits . in indiana , similarly , `` there is n't really any particular restriction on what you can buy with your money . . .as long as you spend the money , '' said christopher holly , a paralegal with indian legal-services ' bloomington-office .
