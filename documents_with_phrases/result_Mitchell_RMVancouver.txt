1 . introduction in recent years , considerable-attention has focused on increasing-competition in the provision of postal-services . the reasoning is that competitive-pressure brings about productive efficiency , efficient-price-structures , product-innovation , and the elimination of economic-rents . postal-administrations , however , are often under constraints that limit their ability to respond to such pressure . consider the united states postal-service . it is constrained by laws and regulations formulated by congress over more than two centuries . this political-process focused as much on social considerations as on the kinds of market-forces that shape competitive-outcomes . and once made , provisions have tended to remain . these observations apply , though in somewhat altered form , even since the 1 presented at the conference on postal and delivery-economics , the center for research in regulated industries at rutgers university , vancouver , canada , june 710 , 2000 2 the writer is special assistant to the postal-rate commission , an independent regulatory-agency of the united states government . the views expressed herein are his own and do not necessarily represent those of the commission or any of its members . correspondence may be sent to rmit @ iname.com . postal-reorganization act of 1970 . specifically , that act turned rate making over to an independent postal-rate commission , but it also specified a range of factors to which the commission must give weight and it required that certain-classification-structures of the past be honored.3 this paper focuses on changes the united states postal-service would make if it had the freedom to position itself to withstand competition in all of its markets . ( crew 1995 ) after such adjustment , it might become a sustainable-monopoly . if this occurred , the service 's configuration would be that of a successful competitor and , at the same time , any benefits from having one provider would be retained . these benefits include economies of scale and joint-production . no changes of any kind are advocated . note that the extent of any changes that would be made is a measure of the extent of non-market-choices that have been allowed by the protection currently provided . creating a competitive-environment would involve , at a minimum , eliminating the private express statutes4 and the mailbox rule.5 absent these , some portions of the mail-stream would attract 3 as discussed below , it required-continuation of 5 preferred subclasses . 4 these statutes are laws that comprise the letter-mail-monopoly . 5 the mailbox-rule specifies that no one other than the postal-service ( and the addressee ) may put mail into the box . this rule is part of the united states criminal code . no other country has such a rule . note that eliminating the rule is not a simple change and has a downside . in particular : 1 ) the postal-service itself owns and maintains many of the boxes-specifically those known as `` cluster '' boxes . 2 ) many owners of boxes , particularly those in apartment-complexes and those secured by locks , do not want to open them to all parties . 3 ) the ability of the postal inspection service , or similar-replacement-agency , to control mail fraud would be the attention of competitors . the postal-service would suffer financial-losses . this could lead to a spiral of rate-increases and further volume-losses . the postal-service would be better off if it lowered selected rates and took back some of the lost-volume . if it did this , some of its new competitors would be driven out of business , causing both investor-losses and charges that the government should not be competing with private-enterprise . such a scenario is not desirable . a much better approach would be to allow the postal-service to make adjustments first . accordingly , the setting of this paper is that all protection will be removed and that the postal-service is given wide-latitude to make its products and services as uncontestable as possible . and if it were found to be a sustainable-monopoly , one could ask whether that situation would be better than the one that exists now . there are at least two reasons why it might . first , competitive-configurations give superior , cost-based-signals to buyers so that the value of the service received is greater . second , the postal-service would have to face real competitive threats at all times . in fact , some business at the margins would probably be lost . therefore , the entire-organization would sense on a regular basis that competitors stand ready to take its customers , and it would see some customers leaving . such pressure might not satisfy those who envision a market with a number of active reduced if general-access to the boxes were allowed . and , many members of the general-population favor the rule because it reduces the number of people who have competitors , but having a number of active-competitors is not always a viable-option . the next-section discusses general-guidelines for the paper . the third-section identifies changes that the postal-service would make immediately . section four looks at how the range of postal-products might change . it points to general-directions and is not precise . the fifth-section discusses worksharing and contracting , while the sixth-deals with the general-issue of cost-recognition in rate design . it focuses to a considerable-extent on weaknesses in the current-state of knowledge . the seventh and eighth-sections discuss costs by destination and by customer . then the next two discuss inverse-price-caps and the benefits of having one government-provider . a conclusion follows . 2 . general guide lines first , it is necessary to discuss the framework within which the postal-service 's adjustment-process will be considered . as noted above , relaxing the private express-statutes is the essential first step . hiding under the statutes , however , is a rule mandating that all bills , statements of account , and personal or handwritten-correspondence , if mailed , must be mailed first class ( the mbmfc rule ) . to a much greater degree than is commonly recognized , this rule is critically-important to the functioning of the postal-service as it now exists . the mbmfc rule requires a substantial-portion of the mail-volume to be sent at high first-class-rates , instead of at the lower standard-a-rates , even though the senders may not value the high service-levels or the special-features of first class.6 if the rule were eliminated , the postal-service would lose a large-portion of its revenue , immediately , with little or no reduction in cost , and rate adjustments would have to be made . as an economic-matter , it is possible that much of the mbmfc mail is high-demand-mail , and thus that the rule-segments the market according to demand . in order to continue benefiting from this split , the postal-service might try to maintain it , even without the statutes . but since rates based on content are seldom the outcome of competitive-forces , such an effort would in all likelihood fail . what is important to understand is that the mbmfc rule is fundamental to first class and standard a as we know them , and eliminating it would unleash forces that would lead to a major restructuring , not to a minor-adjustment . in addition , it seems likely that the postal-service would be prohibited from selling below incremental-cost , would be required to preserve some form of universal service,7 and would be permitted to adjust its service-levels . also , the postal-service would be allowed to grant-volume-discounts and to negotiate contract-rates . another question concerns the most effective way to install a profit-motive . in general , the outcome of effective-competition is overcome by licensing-access to the mail-box . 6 in addition to its high service-levels , first class offers free-forwarding and is sealed ( legally protected ) against inspection . standard a is deferrable , without these features , and has a lower rate . expected to be a normal-profit-level , with the understanding that unusually efficient-firms might achieve supra-normal-profits for a time . one possibility would be to allow a portion of any profit to be used for performance-bonuses to management , but there would be reason for concern if high and persistent-profits resulted . also , there would be concern if monopoly-power allowed certain-products to have excessive-prices . in order to attenuate these concerns , it might be reasonable to place-price-caps on any de facto monopoly-mail-categories , particularly any used by small mailers with no alternatives.8 within this set of rules , particularly if profits are allowed , the postal-service would behave much like a profit-maximizing-firm . considerable-attention would be paid to demand and to prices that could be charged successfully . in addition , one would expect a renewed interest in costs for narrow-product-categories , even for specific customers.9 if the private express-statutes were repealed , it is possible that congress would also change the framework for labor-negotiations , especially the no-strike-rule and the requirement for binding-arbitration when no agreement is reached through collective 7 the restriction would be that it must provide some reasonable level of service on seemingly reasonable-terms to all recipients . 8 a regulator might well be required to administer any price-caps , incremental-cost-floors , or other restrictions . 9 note that the effects of postal-service adjustments could be substantial and widespread , not only on mailers who have invested heavily around the present-structure of products and rates , but also on such competitors as newspapers . some of these groups would strongly resist any changes . bargaining . it might also lift the pay-caps on management salaries . even without such changes , the postal-service could pursue regional-wage-differentials . for purposes of this paper , however , it is not necessary to specify a new labor-environment . what is important is that labor-negotiations take place within the framework of a situation where the loss of business to competitors is an everyday-reality . if the postal-service makes all feasible changes and the markets are found not to be contestable , it will be because the economies of scale and joint-production , and the advantages of being an incumbent,10 are larger than any disadvantages associated with the levels of productivity or wages . 3 . immediate-changes with the freedoms and goals described above , there are a number of changes that the postal-service would make immediately . first , it would eliminate the `` preferred '' categories of mail , all of which have rates that are below corresponding commercial-rates . this means there would be no separate-in-county-rates , no separate-rates for classroom-material , no separate-rates for nonprofit-organizations ( which exist both in periodicals and in standard a ) , no separate-rates for library mail,11 and no separate-rates for science-of- 10 other advantages the postal-service could retain relate to such things as the payment of taxes , the need for a return on investment , the right of eminent-domain , and immunity from parking tickets . congress would have to decide on such issues . 11 free for the blind-mail would continue to be available only if the government continued to provide a subsidy to support it . also , the government might continue special-arrangements relating to voter registration . as long as there is an appropriation , these programs do not put the postal-service at a competitive-disadvantage . agriculture-mail . under the rate-levels of the most recently completed rate-case , eliminating the preferred-categories would yield about onethird of a billion dollars in additional-revenue . second , several special-rate-arrangements would be discontinued . specifically , reduced-rates for books would be eliminated , and even if there were a separate-subclass for them , it would not have rates that are invariant with distance.12 also , periodicals would not receive reduced-rates , and any rates that resulted would not depend on the proportion of advertising content.13 these changes would increase-revenue by another nine-tenths of a billion dollars . these amounts14 are not large , but competition generally prevents charging higher rates to some customers in order to fund reduced-rates for others . the above changes would allow substantial-reductions in the complexity of rates and in the complexity of the data-systems , which in turn would allow improvements in the costs and volumes for the subclasses that remained . a third-change that would be made immediately concerns the provisions for parcel-mail in alaska . presently , as a matter of policy , senders of parcels to residents in the alaska bush ( which is not accessible by surface-transportation ) pay-surface-rates for mail that is transported by air in low-volumes . this would not be done in a 12 the law currently specifies that the rates for books will not vary with distance . this makes the book-subclass very inefficient at serving those for whom it was established . 13 under the existing-rate arrangement , the postal-service can consider externalities in setting-rates . this would not occur in a competitive-system . competitive-system . to places where surface-transportation is not available , senders would be required to pay air-rates , and possibly-air-rates keyed to the characteristics of the alaskan-air system . according to rate-case-figures , this would provide additional-revenues of about $ 70 million , but one would expect associated adjustments that went beyond this figure . fourth , there would be post-office closings . it is not easy to predict which post-offices would be closed . using conservative guidelines , an analysis done in the late-1970s concluded that about 12,000 offices should be closed.15 services for people using these offices would be provided in a less expensive way , using-contract stations in some cases . since a number of offices have been closed in the last 20 years , this estimate of 12,000 may not be current . but if $ 30,000 per year were saved for 12,000 offices , another one-third of a billion dollars would become available . fifth , there might be changes in the role the postal-service plays in policing the fraudulent-use of the mails . in a competitive-environment , it might not be left with police-powers and the right to select those activities in the crime-area that would give it a competitive advantage . one alternative would be to turn this function over to the department of justice . finally , there are some operational-changes that would probably be made . 1 ) the postal-service would undoubtedly begin 14 these amounts were calculated conservatively and would vary by rate-case . handling unaddressed-mail on city routes,16 even as it does already on rural routes.17 2 ) the postal-service might stop ( or substantially alter ) its detached address label program for advertising-mail . for mailers , the use of detached-labels would be a poor-alternative to using unaddressed-mail ; for the postal-service , the use of detached-labels is not well aligned with current and future-automation-plans , and it may aggravate the alignment of rates and costs . 3 ) the postal-service would probably make changes in the way postage is sold . currently it adheres to a policy that postage will be sold at face-value , regardless of the costs associated with its sale . a first step might be discounts for the use of meter and permit indicia , which cost much less than stamps , but other changes would follow . ( haldi 1999 ) 4 . basic products offered except for the creation of worksharing-discounts and express mail , the basic-product-line of the postal-service was inherited from congress at the time of postal-reorganization in 1970.18 it is not 15 at the end of fy 1998 , there were 27,952 post-offices . each post-office has a postmaster . this count does not include stations , branches , or contract-stations . annual report of the postmaster general , 1998 . 16 unaddressed-mail would go to all stops on a carrier 's route . presently , addresses are required on such pieces . this is essentially a make-work-scheme : the mailers do the extra-work of putting the address on each piece and the postal-service does the extra-work of arranging these pieces in delivery-order . note that the postal-services in many other countries carry unaddressed-mail . 17 an alternative to unaddressed-mail would be to auction off the right to be a third-bundle on specific-days in specific-post-offices . a related-change would be to set box-rents at what the traffic will bear . 18 the express mail subclass and ecom were created since 1970 . congress changed the qualifications for in-county-rates in 1986 . the following-subclasses have been eliminated : ecom , transient , controlled-circulation , special delivery , and single-piece third . limited-circulation was eliminated , but it was not a subclass . known what products would evolve under competition . to stimulate discussion , five perspectives are offered below . 4.1 . speed of service two important-characteristics of mail are : 1 ) it does not cost more to process some batches of mail before others , and 2 ) the volume of mail-fluctuates . to accommodate these fluctuations and use-resources evenly , it would seem reasonable to offer two tiers of service : rapid and deferred , with air-transportation being used for the rapid-product . other distinctions are possible , such as bulk and nonbulk , but the speed-distinction would seem to dominate . the postal-service has two basic-subclasses for letters and flats : first class ( originally-rapid , non-bulk , and sealed against inspection ) and standard a ( originally-deferrable , bulk , and not sealed against inspection ) . over time these distinctions have deteriorated . first , due in part to worksharing-programs , there are now bulk-categories in first class . second , a substantial-portion of standard a is entered into the postal-service near its destination , in which case the opportunity to defer is limited . third , mailers and recipients are demanding on-time-delivery of standard a , and the postal-service is accommodating these interests . one could argue that many mailers are getting first-class-service at standard-a-rates . fourth , many mailers of first class are not concerned about inspection . fifth , the rate-structures of first class and standard a are dissimilar in rather extreme-ways , detracting-attention from any focus on service . nonetheless , the rationality of service-tiers remains . if the mbmfc rule was removed and all mailers could choose between 11 first class and standard a , and if the fundamental-distinction between the two was service , one would expect a moderate-rate difference based on a real-service-difference . also , one would expect increased similarity in their rate-structures . but the assumption that change would center around these two subclass may not be a good one . more pervasive-changes would seem likely , but it is not clear what they would be . 4.2 . tolerance for the irregular throughout its history , the postal-service has backed away from constraints on the dimensions and characteristics of pieces that can be mailed . the view has been that its mission is to serve and that whatever is mailed will be delivered . in many cases , and often for the same rate , a piece can be handwritten or typed , awkward or standard in shape , flimsy or stiff.19 this posture has resulted in the engineers being told to design equipment and mail-handling systems that will handle a frightening-range of mail characteristics . this has presented design-difficulties and has resulted in costly-equipment . it has also led to operating difficulties and to high processing-costs . evidence of tolerance follows : 1 ) it was not until 1979 that a non-standard-surcharge was put on first-class-mail , and even now it applies only to the first ounce . 2 ) except for some recent automation-categories , there is no rate-distinction in first class among letters , flats , and parcels . therefore , a letter weighing more than one ounce 19 in fy 1998 , the postal-service processed 15 billion handwritten-addresses . annual report of the postmaster general , 1998 . the report says : `` our clerks or our new technology read your handwriting , no matter how 'creative ' it might be . '' p. 54. pays the same rate as a flat or a parcel of the same weight . 3 ) there is no rate-distinction in priority between flats and parcels , even though there could be differences in the equipment used to process them . 4 ) except for the barcode-discount , periodicals rates are not based on shape or machinability . some magazines , for example , are too heavy to be processed on flat-sorting-machines and newspapers would be expected to have costs different from those of magazines . 5 ) handwritten-addresses and pieces without zip-codes are accepted without surcharge . 6 ) during high-speed , mechanized processing , some flats with open-edges become aerodynamic . yet , despite a large-cost-difference , there is no rate-distinction between these flats and those that can be processed effectively . 7 ) nonautomated-first-class and standard-a-mailers have the option of requesting that their mail be processed manually , even though the costs for such processing are substantially higher than mechanized processing.20 it is doubtful that any of these tolerances would exist in a competitive-system . conceptually , one can visualize a streamlined , low-cost processing-system for well-defined-letter-size-pieces that are machinereadable . similar-systems could exist for flats and for parcels . such systems might allow lower rates for qualifying-mail , while pieces that would not qualify might be rejected or required to pay a surcharge based on costs . prices that recognize costs send signals to mailers concerning the work that needs to be done . they prevent high-cost-mailers from being cross subsidized by low-cost mailers , and they 20 see response to interrogatory oca/usps-84 in docket no . r2000-1 . 13 allow the efficiencies of a low-cost-mailstream to be available to all who can use them . one can surmise that a competitive postal-service would do a better job of presenting technologically-feasible , low-cost-product options to mailers and either rejecting non-conforming-pieces or levying-surcharges . certainly a competitor would go after such lowcost-pieces first , as has roadway package service in the parcel area . 4.3 . demand one of the hallmarks of competitive-pricing is that higher prices are charged to higher-demand customers . this practice becomes even more pronounced-outside of a breakeven-requirement , when additions to net-revenue can be kept . under current-conventions the postal-service sets prices for whole-subclasses and can not select specific-customers for surcharges or discounts . and for these subclasses , there are no cases where a lower price will lead to an increase in net-revenue . however , if there are categories of mail that are attractive to competitors , these categories should be viewed as extremely-elastic and the postal-service would be expected to move its rates toward a lower markup over costs . in other words , competition would force a response from the postal service.21 similarly , higher rates would be expected for less elastic-categories . 21 an extreme , but possibly-realistic , situation should not be overlooked . suppose a potential-competitor needed a critical-mass in order to begin operations . if one mailer were large enough to provide that mass , or nearly provide it , that mailer , by threatening to leave the postal-service , might be able to negotiate extremely-low rates . dealing with this kind of situation is different from anything being done today . basically , the postal-service would be expected to assess competition and mailers ' willingness to pay , and then to segment its markets as much as possible . indeed , one would expect a degree of creativity from the postal-service in finding-ways to acknowledge demand . 4.4 . content the subclasses of mail that exist today are based in considerable-degree on content . in short , there is a subclass for library-materials , one for books , one for bound printed matter , and several for periodicals . further , the periodicals subclasses have strict-rules on enclosures , have regulations that depend on whether the publication is bound or unbound , and most have rates that depend on whether the material inside is advertising or editorial.22 also , there are cases where merchandise is treated different from non-merchandise and where , under the mbmfc rule discussed above , some kinds of content may use one subclass and not others . in cases where the willingness to pay of the sender is related to content , it might be possible to argue that content would continue to be recognized in rates . however , it is quite-uncommon for competitive-carriers to differentiate based on content . instead , one would expect the emphasis on content to either decrease significantly or disappear . if content did continue as a rate-setting-factor , it would probably take a different-form from what now exists . 22 in postal-parlance , editorial is defined as material that is not advertising . 15 4.5 . service measurement under the assumption that the level of service is important , knowledge about the level achieved is important . this has been a difficult-issue for the postal-service . in recent years an external measurement-system for first-class-mail has been developed and one now exists for priority , but actual-service-levels for most other subclasses have been a great-unknown . to fill this void , many mailers measure the service their own mail receives . the postal-service usually responds to these measurements by saying that they are not statistically-valid or that they are not representative . nevertheless , it is well known that actual-service-levels are often quite far from the published standards . in a postal-service poised to meet competition , considerably more effort would be directed toward meeting published standards and toward measuring the service achieved . mailers would demand such performance and such knowledge . competitors would jump at the chance to meet unmet-mailer-needs . a step beyond this issue is the question of tracking and tracing . the postal-service is behind its competitors at this point ; under competition , catch-up would be expected to occur at a faster pace . 5 . worksharing and contracting one way to compete is to bring the strengths of the private sector-in-house . this can be done through worksharing-discounts or contracts and is especially-effective when mailers can do the work in a different way than the postal-service . ( mitchell 1999 ) the amount of work that can be turned over in this way is quite-large . 16 consider the following-example . suppose mailers can sort addresses on a computer and then print them in zip code order . suppose further that they can do this for 1.5 cents per piece and that this saves the postal-service 4 cents per piece . in the areas where worksharing-discounts are offered now , the tendency has been to move toward a discount of 4 cents . this lowers the net-mailing cost for the mailers involved and makes them less likely to go to competitors . however , if the mailers were not on the verge of stopping the worksharing-activity or of going to competitors , the postal-service would maximize its financial position by giving a discount closer to the figure of 1.5 cents . so , with freedom to compete , there could be important-changes in the way worksharing-discounts are set . of course , prior to such changes , information and analysis would be needed . the postal-service has extensive-worksharing-discounts . there are , however , some limitations . first , no discounts are based on any cost-savings associated with the avoidance of collection-activities . second , discounts for transportation have been limited to standard a , priority over 5 pounds , and parts of standard b . there are no dropship-discounts in express mail , none in first class , limited-ones in periodicals , and none in special standard or library rate . furthermore , even the dropship-discounts in standard a are limited . for example , mail traveling 2,000 miles to get to a destination-facility gets the same dropship-discount as similar mail traveling 200 miles . similarly , 3 truckloads of mail weighing 3 ounces per piece get the same dropship-discount as 1 truckload of mail weighing 1 ounce per piece . clearly the postal-service could do more to transfer some of these operations to the private sector through worksharing-discounts . another way to shift work to the private sector is through contracts with suppliers . this also has been done . for example , contractors who submit the lowest bids do nearly all of the long-haul-trucking . similarly , air-transportation is provided under contract , and a sorting-hub for express mail is operated under contract . a number of contract-stations also exist for retail-services . there may , however , be limits to how much-contracting can be done effectively , partly because of the time and cost associated with utilizing , placing , and monitoring-contracts . consider the contract the postal-service now has with emery worldwide to process and transport priority mail . the idea was for the low-bidder to operate a highly focused sorting and transportation-system designed to get priority mail delivered on time . suppose , however , with suitable-reverence to adam smith , one looks at this plan according to its degree of roundaboutness . here is what happens : 1 ) the postal-service collects the pieces and brings them to a central-point . 2 ) the postal-service goes through a sorting-process to separate those pieces that go to emery . 3 ) emery picks up the pieces at the cutoff-time and transports them to its own facility . 4 ) the pieces are unloaded and fed into sorting-machines . 5 ) after sorting , the pieces are transported to an air facility and then sent by air to a destination , possibly using lower-capacity-equipment than the postal-service might use . 6 ) the pieces are loaded on a truck and transported to a postal-service facility . 7 ) the postal-service integrates the pieces back into its own system and takes them to the facility out of which the carriers operate . this sounds like a lot of steps . taking a degree of writer 's license , the alternative is to leave them in the postal-system , sort them first , transport them immediately , and deliver them . the jury is still out on the effectiveness of the emery contract . there are indications , however , that emery is losing money , that the postal-service is spending more than if it had done the work itself , and that there has not been a significant-improvement in delivery-performance . it appears that the roundaboutness and the associated extra-steps may be taking a toll . whether this is an effective-avenue to lower costs and improve performance remains to be seen . note that the possibility of contracting out is not limited to operations prior to delivery . if there are economies of scale in delivery , and certainly if mail-recipients do not want multiple carriers accessing their mail-boxes , it would be possible to define routes , along with their expected workload , and auction them off to the lowest bidder . this is already done on a few `` star-routes '' at about one-half the cost of rural-carriers , and it is reportedly being done by competitors of the postal-services in the parcel area . ( o'reilly ) 6 . cost-recognition in rate design rates for the postal-service are set following extensive hearings before the postal-rate commission . voluminous-testimony is provided , as are the results of numerous-cost-studies . in fact , the volume of cost-data amounts to tens of thousands of pages . based on the data and the testimony submitted , as well as on evidence 19 submitted by dozens of intervenors , rates are set in a very detailed way . it is not uncommon for extensive-testimony to focus on discount-differences of one or two tenths of a cent per piece . despite all of this attention , there are weaknesses in what is know about costs . for example : 1 ) little is known about the relative-costs of flats and parcels in priority and express mail . 2 ) not enough is known about the effects of weight on costs in first class and standard a , despite extensive related-testimony23 . 3 ) knowledge is limited on the relation between weight and non-transportation-costs in nearly all subclasses . 4 ) not enough is known about how nontransportation-costs vary with distance . 5 ) based on studies that have been questioned extensively , the rates for standard-a-mail do not vary with weight up to about 3.3 ounces . this means , for example , that for a large-mailing going 3,000 miles , the same postage would be charged for ¾-ounce pieces requiring one tractor-trailer as would be charged for 3-ounce pieces requiring four tractor-trailers . 6 ) the extent of lower costs for higher-volume-mailers is unknown . if the postal-service faced-competition in all areas , some of these weaknesses might be associated with cream that could be skimmed . a response by the postal-service would be expected . improved cost-studies would result . this is not meant to suggest that costs have not been studied extensively . a great deal of money is being spent on cost-studies , but when the budget for these studies is 23 competitors understand clearly that 15-ounce pieces of saturation-mail can be carried privately for less than standard-a-rates , while 4-ounce pieces can not . compared to a revenue that is near $ 67 billion , the percentage amount is probably-minimal . when it is suggested that the postal-service should spend more on cost-studies , questions arise about private-sector-expenditures in this area . there are at least three possibilities . one , other firms spend more . two , most other productive-operations are easier to study and understand , since few firms have 40,000 locations and a large-proportion of their workforce working-outdoors . three , operating-managers in the private sector , based on their extensive-experience , are allowed to prepare mental-estimates of what costs probably are . however it would work out , it seems clear that competition would improve the alignment of rates and costs . 7 . costs by destination in recent years a number of studies have analyzed the widely held belief that rural-routes are more expensive than city-routes . the findings confirm the expectation to some extent , but the split is not clean . it turns out that the income of the recipients is also important , with many low-income , low-volume-city-routes being unprofitable . ( cohen 1993 ) one reason for being concerned about this issue is the possibility that , were the private express-statutes to be relaxed , competitors would take the profitable-routes and leave the incumbent-administration with the unprofitable-routes . in the same vein , mail for the highest-volume-recipients is not even delivered � the mailers pick it up . in fact , many of these recipients have unique-zip-codes and their own sorting-bin on the sorting-machines . the question then becomes : would a competitive 21 postal-service establish rate-tiers based on the destination of the mail ? we know , for example , that roadway package service , at least initially , did not solicit mail for residences and that ups charges extra for addresses designated as residential . also , ups selects certain-zip-codes for an additional-surcharge . at least for bulk-mailers , and in a computerized-world , such rate-differences are easy to manage . the postal-service could , for example , place a roman numeral in front of each zip code , yielding a code like i-20878-2619 . the numeral `` i '' could indicate a low-cost-recipient who picks up mail in bulk . the numeral `` ii '' could indicate locations of average income and stop density that are relatively-economical to deliver . the numeral `` iii '' could be for high-cost-areas . rates based on numerals could result , even though there would be transaction-costs . such a system , however , might not be the most desirable , one downside being that the smallest single-piece-mailers could default to a rate that is high enough to cover all destinations . also , to the extent that mailers send broadly to all destinations , a system of this kind would not change postage-bills , it would just increase some rates and decrease others . before leaving the question of higher-cost-delivery-areas , it should be noted that a mitigating-option might be to reduce the number of deliveries per week . ( cohen 1999 ) although many observers would view this as an extreme-step it could reduce costs and allow increased efficiencies . for example , mail could be sorted one day and delivered the next , resulting in a less demanding-schedule . also , the effect on the recipient might not be as large as commonly assumed-in-effect , one-half of the mail would be delayed one day . a related-service-issue is whether there are unreasonable transportation-runs that should be eliminated . that is , a review could be done to see how many transportation-runs are scheduled solely to meet a deadline or a service-standard , but which involve very little-mail . these runs could cost far more than the value of the small-improvement in service . 8 . costs by customer although the details are kept private , it is well known that many private-sector-firms set-rates via contracts with selected customers . sometimes these are based on agreements that the customer will prepare the mail in certain-ways ; at other times they are based on a threat that the mailer will find another carrier . as an economic-matter , it is clear that a postal-service is better off having a customer at a near-cost-price than not having the customer at all . were the postal-service to be allowed to set-rates under contracts , or to bid for business , it would need costs by customer . at the present-time , costs by customer are not available and the service 's costing-systems are not set up to develop such costs . in short , this is a whole new costing-area that would need to be undertaken.24 if contract-rates with selected customers were allowed , several-questions would need to be addressed . first , would the terms of each agreement be made public ? the answer is probably yes . second , would all customers satisfying the requirements of the contract be allowed to use the same rates ? the answer here is probably yes as well , even though private-sector-firms would say no on both points . third , how rigorous and defensible would customer-specific costs have to be in order to qualify as an acceptable-base for a contract , and would the costing receive review by any outside party ? one is tempted to argue that there should be a defensible study , but the problem is obvious- some private-firms undoubtedly base-contracts on the judgment of the managers involved . furthermore , the result can be based on negotiating-skills . the prospect of allowing-contract-prices in a government postal-service , based on judgment and negotiating-skills , raises another question . specifically , private-firms have stockholders . if discounts are too large , the stockholders pay , along with managers who may lose their jobs . whether a government postal-service can engage in these kinds of negotiations deserves serious-study . 9 . inverse-price-caps if the postal-service should have a greater degree of pricing freedom and be able to engage in negotiations with selected mailers , one way to provide such freedom , even without further changes , would be to allow the postal-service to operate under inverse-price-caps . within the existing rate-setting-framework , the idea of an inverse-price-cap is to allow the commission to recommend an average-price-level ( or index ) that is viewed as a floor . then the postal-service could make wide-ranging-adjustments of the rates in the subclass , including-contract-rates for some of the subclass users , as long as the average-rate for the subclass does not go below the inverse-cap . if the commission believed that a low-markup for the subclasses was in order , then the low-markup could be recommended . full-review would be provided and all affected-parties would have an opportunity to be heard . this is an alternative to some recent-legislative suggestions that the markup on the competitive-subclasses as a group must be at least as large as the markup on all other subclasses . the inverse-price-cap is a relatively-simple notion that would require no more than a minor-adjustment to the law , if one is needed at all . it deserves further study . within the framework of this paper , it could play a role as well . specifically , suppose unconstrained-competition were allowed but the postal-service turned out to have sufficient-market-power in some product-areas to allow other products to be priced at or near the level of incremental-cost . if this was viewed as unfair-competition , an independent regulatory-commission could establish and monitor certain inverse-price-caps . this would provide substantial-freedom to compete , but within a constrained framework . 10 . having a government-provider one of the questions of this paper is whether the postal-service could become a sustainable-monopoly if all protection were removed . there are both disadvantages and advantages to having a single government-provider under these conditions . among the disadvantages are that the degree of innovation and product-differentiation might continue to be limited . on the advantages-side , several considerations are relevant . the postal-service has established the zones and the zip-codes that are now used by all carriers . it also manages a forwarding-system and a change-of-address system,25 both of which honor-policies on privacy . in addition , it carries mail that is sealed against inspection and acts as a watchdog over fraudulent-use of the mails . if desired , having one carrier would allow the maintenance of the mailbox-rule ( with , as discussed above , a reduction in competitive-pressure ) , which in turn would be helpful in protecting the mail . also , residents could leave originating-mail in their boxes and know who would pick it up and that it would be handled appropriately . having one carrier would also reduce vehicle-traffic in neighborhoods and allow familiarity with recipients . such a carrier can deal better with irregularities and can watch over the delivery-area . 25 if competition was allowed and competitors arose , it might be that a change-of-address-system could be operated by a separate entity and made available to all competitors . this is reportedly being done in sweden . 11 . conclusion it is a common-belief that the private express-statutes and the mailbox-rule serve as protection to allow universal-service at uniform-rates . when viewed in terms of changes the postal-service would likely make if it wished to make itself into a sustainable-monopoly , it becomes clear that these restrictions protect much more than just universal-service . they also protect the preferred subclasses of mail , low-rates for periodicals , classifications that are not market based , rates that do not follow costs , and a range of other practices discussed in this paper . if these are not inherently-desirable , or if a decision were made to give them less weight , changes could be made to eliminate them now , even without relaxing the statutes . if some of them are desirable but not others , limited-changes could be made , one possibility being inverse-price-caps . there are , however , benefits to having a government postal-service , in addition to the uniform-rates and special-rate structures . specifically , the postal-service establishes the zones and the zip-codes , guards privacy , forwards-mail , and protects against crime . also , having one postal-system reduces traffic and pollution . further , if the mailbox-rule were maintained , only one person will pick up an outgoing-letter placed in the mailbox . further analysis is needed of the benefits of the current-system relative to the benefits of an alternative-system , and of whether some of the benefits of an alternative-system can be obtained by making-adjustments to the current-system . references crew , michael a. and paul r. kleindorfer , 1995 , `` pricing in postal-services under competitive-entry ''
