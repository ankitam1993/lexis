united states general-accounting-office internal-control gao exposure-draft december 2000 maintaining effective-control over employee time and attendance-reporting gao01186g abbreviations introduction in recent years significant-changes in work-place-habits and technological-advances have affected the manner in which time and attendance ( t & a ) reporting is accomplished . for example , more flexible-work-schedules and places , and the trend in government to streamline operations have provided a major-impetus for changes in t & a systems . however , perhaps the most significant-influence on these changes is advancing-technology and the increased use of automation . the government-paperwork elimination act ( gpea ) encourages the movement toward paperless-applications and the use of electronic-signatures . although gpea focuses on electronic systems regarding-information obtained from and provided to sources outside the government , it provides an additional-impetus to agencies to seek further applications of paperless-systems and use of electronic-signatures . trends toward increased automation and workplace-flexibility have changed the operating-environment . however , the need for good internal-control continues to exist . to keep abreast of the changes , especially those in automation , we have revised this document to emphasize the attention that should remain regarding effective internal-control in t & a systems . this document offers suggestions for taking advantage of the advancements in automated t & a systems and updates the previous-guidance to incorporate guidance offered in response to agency requests.1 as advancing-technologies continue , managers have greater flexibility in designing and implementing t & a systems best suited for their agencies . in designing and implementing new t & a systems or components of existing-systems , management should strive for costbeneficial-systems and related internal-control . the traditional-work-schedule followed by civilian-employees differs from those generally followed by members on active-duty of the armed-services . because traditional-work-schedules influence internal-control in t & a systems , this document contains two major-parts , the first dealing with civilian-employees who are expected to be `` working , '' usually during certain-times and the second part dealing with members of the active-duty armed-services who are expected to be in a `` duty-status '' and thus on call 24 hours a day . part i , civilian-employees , provides guidance for civilian-employees , and part ii , military-service-members , provides guidance for military-service-members . employees who are paid regardless of their presence or absence and who do not accrue leave under 5 u.s.c . 6301 et seq . ( e.g. , certain political-appointees ) are exempt from the provisions of this document.2 questions on or interpretations of any material in this document may be submitted to the managing director , financial-management and assurance , u.s. general-accounting-office , 441 g street nw , washington , dc 20548 . 1 when issued in final , this document will replace our 1996 revision to title 6 , `` pay , leave , and allowances , '' of the gao policyandproceduresmanualforguidanceoffederalagencies . 2 see comptroller general decision b123698 ( may 10 , 1978 ) . ( blank ) part i : civilian-employees internal-control-objectives in t & a systems the primary-objective of a t & a system is to ensure that hours worked , hours in pay-status , and hours absent are properly reported . reliable-data are important to accurately-compute and account for computed-pay , leave , and allowances . to achieve this objective , management should have in place an internal-control system that provides reasonable-assurance that ( 1 ) t & a transactions are properly authorized and approved and ( 2 ) t & a data are completely and accurately recorded and retained . t & a transactions are properly authorized and approved the nature and extent of t & a transaction-approvals and controls can vary among t & a systems . fully automated-systems , for example , may require fewer approvals than manual-systems because of automated-edits and controls , and the use of automated signatures . nevertheless , the nature and extent of t & a approvals must be such that management has assurance that supervisors or other officials know they are accountable for the approvals of an employee 's work-time and absences . this helps ensure that accurate t & a information is recorded and reported for the purposes of computing-pay and allowances . primary-responsibility for authorizing and approving t & a transactions rests with the employee 's supervisor , who approves the employee 's t & a reports . timekeepers3 and supervisors must be aware of the work-time and absence of employees for whom they are responsible to ensure the reliability of t & a data . to the extent practical , changes to an employee 's normal-work-schedule should generally be approved prior to the change actually occurring . unanticipated-changes should be reviewed for approval or disapproval as soon as reasonably-possible . t & a data are complete and accurate because most federal civilian-employees are paid on an hourly-basis ( or fractions of an hour ) and earn and charge leave on that basis , a complete and accurate-record of the time an employee works must be retained as an official-agency-record available for review or inspection . to provide a basis for pay , leave , and benefits , the records must include aggregate-hours of regular-time , other time ( e.g. , overtime , credit-hours , or compensatory-time ) , and leave.4 to help ensure accuracy , the completed records must be reviewed and approved by the supervisor ( or other equivalent-official ) . in an automated-environment , system-edits and other automated-tests can 3 the traditional t & a system normally involved a timekeeper who was responsible for assisting-supervisors in recording and verifying-employees ' work-time and absences . new t & a systems can reduce or even eliminate timekeepers ' duties and shift the responsibilities to employees or supervisors . regardless of the changes made , recording accurate t & a information remains the primary-control-objective . 4 traditionally , daily-arrival and departure-times were required to be recorded . although it is not required that daily-records be maintained , agency-management may choose to do so by using signin/signout sheets or other means . assist the supervisor in his or her review and verify that recorded work-time is accurate and allowable . reliance on internal-controls in a t & a system as t & a systems evolve toward increasingly automated-methods of recording and reporting-employee-work and leave times , it is important to implement and maintain a welldefined-system that provides management with the confidence that controls are working as designed . this can be done by : • having a welldefined organizational-structure and flow of t & a data with clearly written policies and procedures setting forth the responsibilities of employees , timekeepers ( if applicable ) , and supervisors regarding-recording , examining , and approving t & a transactions . • effectively applying available-technology and concepts to achieve efficient and effective t & a system processes in accordance with applicable-requirements and the environment in which the agency operates . • having the ability to record payroll-costs by appropriation , organizational-code , and work-activity to facilitate application of required cost-accounting for financial and program-management . • reviewing and testing all aspects of the t & a systems' processing-procedures and controls in sufficient-scope , depth , and frequency to provide reasonable-assurance that key-procedures and controls are working and effective and that data-integrity is maintained . agencies ' t & a systems are subject to periodic-review under the federal-managers ' financial-integrity act of 1982 ( fmfia ) ( 31 u.s.c . 3512 ( c ) , ( d ) ) .5 recording and maintaining complete and accurate t & a records required t & a information the following t & a information and documentation should be recorded and maintained for each employee for each pay-period : 1. employee-name and unique identifying-number ( e.g. , a social-security-number ) , 5standardsforinternalcontrolinthefederalgovernment ( gao/aimd0021.3.1 ) was revised in november 1999 , and is available on the internet , gao home-page ( www.gao.gov ) under `` other publications . '' it is also available in hard-copy by calling ( 202 ) 5126000 or at the u.s. general-accounting-office , 700 4th street nw , room 1100 , washington , d.c . in addition , the office of management and budget ( omb ) requirements for evaluating financial-systems and controls are in omb circular a123 , internalcontrolsystems ( june 1995 ) and omb circular a127 , financialmanagementsystems ( july 1993 ) . these omb and gao issuances establish the criteria and rules for assessing and reporting annually on the status of agency-systems and controls . 2. pay-period-number or dates , 3. hours worked , 4. hours of premium-pay , by type , to which the employee is entitled , 5. dates and number of hours of leave ( by type ) , credit-hours , and compensatory-hours earned and used,6 6. evidence of approval by an authorized official ( usually the supervisor ) , 7. any required supporting-documentation or records for absences , and 8. other information-agencies believe necessary . a t & a record containing all required data-elements can be ( 1 ) a manually completed hard-copy-document , ( 2 ) an automated-file retained electronically , or ( 3 ) a combination of automated and manual-records . the t & a information can be obtained using a number of different-methods , including but not limited to preprinted or designed t & a forms ; other standard-forms ; internal-memorandums ; emails ; employee , timekeeper , or supervisor notations ( for example , that might result from phone conversations ) ; or other formats so long as the documents are controlled and retained as the official t & a record of employees . the data contained in the t & a records should be linked to accounting-records and provide the necessary-support for financial-reporting and allocation of costs . recording t & a data agency-policy must affix accountability for recording the t & a data referred to in the previous-section . the data may be recorded by the 1. individual-employee , 2. timekeeper , 3. supervisor , or 4. a combination of the three . agency-policy must assign accountability for recording and maintaining t & a data referred to in the previous-section . if the employee is not recording his or her t & a data , the basis for recording the data could be ( 1 ) the timekeeper 's or supervisor 's observation , ( 2 ) time-clocks , or other automated timekeeping-devices , where not prohibited by law , or ( 3 ) other applicable-techniques . the person recording the t & a data acknowledges responsibility for the accuracy of the recorded data . the point at which t & a data are recorded can vary among different t & a systems . for example , t & a data may be recorded ( 1 ) daily , ( 2 ) when deviations occur from an individual's or agency 's established-work-schedule , or ( 3 ) at the end of the pay-period . regardless of the timing of recording t & a data , management must have in place a system of control-techniques that gives reasonable-assurance that the recorded-information reflects time worked , leave taken , or other absences . 6cumulative-balances of available-leave by type per employee are required to be maintained on record . agencies may maintain these cumulative-balances on biweekly or pay-period t & a records which show the available-balances for the pay-period ending . examples of the types of leave on such t & a records include , but are not limited to , annual , sick , and family friendly-leave . supplementary t & a records supplementary t & a records , containing-information not previously discussed , shall be completed and maintained . examples of such records include those for establishing ( 1 ) work schedules,7 ( 2 ) flexiplace arrangements,8 ( 3 ) cumulative-leave-balances available for use by type , ( 4 ) overtime , ( 5 ) compensatory-time earned and used , ( 6 ) credit-hours earned and used under an alternative-work-schedule , and ( 7 ) number of unscheduled-duty-hours . the records must show ( 1 ) an employee 's pay-period-schedules indicating planned start and stop work-times and hours per day for an established-work-schedule , ( 2 ) the aggregate-hours ( or fractions of hours ) and days the employees worked regular-hours , worked overtime , took-leave , or used earned compensatory-time or credit-hours , and ( 3 ) the supervisor 's approval . in order for the agency to properly document and calculate an employee 's overtime-pay-entitlements under 5 u.s.c . chapters 55 and 61 and 29 u.s.c . 201 et seq. , the records must distinguish between regular-overtime and irregular or occasional-overtime . employees temporarily assigned to another agency when an employee is on temporary-assignment to another agency , the agency to which the employee is detailed must record t & a data for the employee in accordance with these requirements . it must also report the information to the employee 's home-agency promptly to facilitate disbursement of pay by the home-agency . access to t & a information access to t & a information should be limited to those authorized to access the information . authorizing and approving t & a transactions attestations , verifications , and approvals this section ( 1 ) defines attestations , verifications , and approvals and ( 2 ) discusses how attestations , verifications , and approvals can be achieved in a manual or automated t & a system environment . attestation refers to an employee affirming t & a data to be true , correct , and accurate . verification is a confirmation , usually by the timekeeper or supervisor , that recorded-information is true , correct , and accurate to the best of his/her knowledge . approval is the supervisor 's , other equivalent-official 's , or higher level-manager 's agreement , ratification , or concurrence to ( 1 ) a planned-work-schedule and leave of employee or ( 2 ) actual t & a data . such approvals represent that the actual-work schedule recorded by the employee or timekeeper is to the best of 7 federal-agencies can allow employees to vary their daily-arrival and departure-times and , under some options , to vary the length of their workday or workweek . in all cases , fulltime-employees are required to work or otherwise account for 80 hours each biweekly pay-period ( 5 u.s.c . 6120 et seq. ) . 8 see office of personnel-management 's ( opm ) memorandum for personnel directors on the subject of alternative-workplace-arrangements , october 21 , 1993. the approving-official 's knowledge true , correct , and accurate , and in accordance with applicable-laws , regulations , and legal decisions . the approving-official acknowledges awareness and understanding of his/her responsibility when approving t & a data . the evidence of attestations , verifications , and approvals will of necessity differ between manual and automated-systems . in manual-systems , attestations , verifications , and approvals are usually shown by a signature or initial of an individual on a hard-copy-document . in automated-systems , they are represented by what can be referred to generically as electronic signatures.9 there are many types of electronic-signature-technologies offering different-degrees of confidence , control , and security . in selecting and/or developing , and implementing a particular electronic-signature technology for an automated t & a application , management must assess the risks associated with the loss , misuse , or compromise of the electronic t & a information and signatures compared to the benefits , costs , and effort associated with selecting and/or developing and managing the automated-systems and electronic signatures.10 see the appendix for a further explanation about electronic-signatures and gao 's review of such applications . authorizing an employee 's work-schedule when ( 1 ) an employee 's work-schedule differs from the agencywide schedule established by management or ( 2 ) reflects a flexible-work program , an employee 's work-schedule should be approved by the supervisor or the official most knowledgeable of the employee's schedule in advance of the period when the plan takes effect . if the schedule is not approved in advance , the plan should be approved as soon after the start of the pay-period as possible . approval must be granted for overtime before the work has been performed when feasible and , when not feasible , as soon as possible after the work has been performed . care must be taken to distinguish between regular-overtime and irregular-overtime or occasional-overtime ( or compensatory-time in lieu of overtime , where allowed ) in order for the agency to properly document and calculate an employee 's overtime-pay-entitlements under 5 u.s.c . chapters 55 and 61 and 29 u.s.c . 201 et seq . approval of leave approval of leave should be made by the employee 's supervisor before the leave is taken . if leave is not approved in advance , it should be reviewed for approval or disapproval as soon as reasonably-possible after taken . 9 the gpea defines `` electronic-signature '' as a method of signing an electronic-message that ( 1 ) identifies and authenticates a particular-person as the source of the electronic-message and ( 2 ) indicates such person 's approval of the information contained in the message . 10 gpea requires agencies to comply with the guidance issued by omb regarding automated-systems that maintain electronic-information as a substitute for paper and use of electronic-signatures . omb issued the guidance in memorandum m0010 , dated april 25 , 2000 . a 29page attachment to the memorandum contains the details of the guidance . also , as part of the omb guidance , the department of justice was charged with developing practical-guidance on legal-considerations related to agencies ' use of electronic-filing and record keeping . the department issued-legalconsiderationsindesigningandimplementing electronicprocesses : aguideforfederalagenciesin november 2000 . attestation and verification by employees and timekeepers the employee and timekeeper , if any , are not required to attest or verify t & a reports and related-documents . however , if management requires such attestations and/or verifications , they should be performed as close to the end of the pay-period as possible . when not possible until after the end of the pay-period , a copy of the t & a report and related-documents , when applicable , should be provided to the employee promptly for attestation and to the timekeeper promptly for verification . the employee and/or timekeeper should promptly disclose any discrepancies to the supervisor . the supervisor should promptly resolve such discrepancies . approval of t & a reports and related-records all t & a reports and related supporting-documents ( e.g. , overtime-pay authorizations ) must be reviewed and approved by an authorized official . review and approval should be made by the official , normally the immediate-supervisor , most knowledgeable of the time worked and absence of the employee involved . approval of t & a reports and related-documents should be based on personal observation , work-output , timekeeper-verification , checking-data against other independent-sources , reliance on other controls , or a combination of these methods . the official most knowledgeable of the time worked should approve any overtime or compensatory-time . care should be taken ( 1 ) to ensure that the overtime was approved , preferably in advance , and ( 2 ) that the amount and type of overtime ( regular or irregular ) , credit-hours , and compensatory-time is accurately recorded . if practical , t & a data must be approved at the end of the last day of the pay-period or later . when this is not feasible because of payroll-processing-requirements to meet established paydays , t & a data must be prepared and approved as close to the end of the pay-period as possible to still allow processing of the payroll by payday . adjustment or corrections after the t & a period ends adjustments or corrections required because of changes after t & a data were approved must be made in the payroll-system and reflected in pay for the pay-period to which the changes apply , when possible . when not possible , adjustments must be made as soon after discovery as practical . any changes must be approved by an authorizing-official before being entered into the payroll-system . selfapproval of t & a reports in general , employees may not approve their own t & a data . however , the head of an agency ( or designee ) may authorize particular-individuals to approve their own t & a data in certain situations or if the individual is a high level-manager ( such as the head of a large-unit within the agency ) . in these situations , an official authorized by the agency-head ( or designee ) must grant advance-authority in writing , and the agency must ensure that effective-controls are in place to ensure the proper-reporting of t & a data . exceptions to the general-prohibition of employees approving their own t & a data are intended to apply when it is not feasible to have t & a data approved by a supervisor . these exceptions include but are not necessarily limited to ( 1 ) employees working alone at a remote-site for long periods and ( 2 ) employees based at the same duty-station as their supervisors or timekeepers but frequently at work-sites away from the duty-station . in other situations when it is not practical for the supervisor to approve t & a data promptly , the employee may be paid and the supervisor may subsequently review and approve the data . transmitting t & a information to payroll t & a information must be transmitted to the payroll-system for all employees or , under exceptionbased-systems , for employees who have changes to their normal-work-schedules . while the choice of methods used to transmit the t & a data may be based on costeffectiveness and management-information-needs , the system used to transmit the information must protect t & a data from unauthorized-change or alteration and must generate a record of any change made . any change to previously attested to and approved data must be reviewed by and attested to by the employee whose data was changed . the changed data must also be reviewed by and approved by an authorized official . exceptionbased-systems exceptionbased t & a systems , as the name implies , require pay-period recording of arrival and departure-times only if material variances11 from preestablished-work-schedules occur . employees' schedules are established , either through management designated work-schedules or by mutual-agreement between employees and management . when employees ' arrival and departure-times for a pay-period are established , these schedules become the basis for recorded t & a data unless material-variances or deviations occur . as previously noted , if no material-variances occur , arrival and departure-times and hours worked per day need not be recorded . material-variances or deviations must be approved by the supervisor before the change occurs , if feasible , or promptly after occurring , if not feasible . as part of their approval of the change , supervisors or designees must verify that the dates and amounts of material-changes have been recorded in the appropriate t & a record . however , in either case ( material-variance or no variance ) each employee 's t & a record must be approved by the supervisor or comparable-official . several-alternatives exist for recording-changes to established schedules . changes can be noted by recording-arrival and departure-times directly on an employee 's time-sheet , recording-arrival and departure-times on a centrally maintained timein/timeout log used by many employees , or noting the number of hours and minutes of the deviation in a record that the supervisor maintains . the method selected by management to record the deviations should be the most efficient and effective one under the circumstances . unless otherwise designated by management , material-variances or deviations from an established-schedule for recording-purposes are those that differ by 1 hour or more during a planned-workday or flex-day . however , if leave is used , a deviation of less than 1 hour could be considered material . for example , if an employee arrives 30 minutes late , but works 30 minutes past the planned departure-time , this would be considered an immaterial-variation and need not be recorded . on the other hand , if the employee chooses to request annual or sick-leave rather than to work for the time absent , then a material-deviation for recording-purposes has occurred . alternative-workplace-arrangements alternative workplace arrangements12 involve working at locations other than the traditional-government-office . locations of alternative-workplaces are usually the employee 's home or telecenters.13 although numerous-benefits exist for both the agency and employees participating in alternative-workplaces ( such as employee moral and lower commuting-costs ) , flexible-workplace is a management-option , not an employee-benefit . employees who work at alternative-work-sites should have a written agreement with their supervisors stipulating , among other items , the period of time the agreement is in effect , days in which the employee will work at the alternative-site , work-assignments and performance , work-schedule , and time and attendance . as a basis for approving t & a data , supervisors are required to obtain reasonable-assurance that employees working at remote sites are working when scheduled and that t & a information accurately reflects time worked and absences from scheduled-tours of duty . numerous-techniques are available to the supervisor to obtain this assurance . for example , reviewing the work-output of the employee and occasional-phone-call or visits to the employee . 12 other terms used to refer to alternative-workplace-arrangements or locations of work are `` flexible-workplace , '' `` flexiplace , '' and '' telecommuting . '' 13 telecenters are facilities away from the traditional-government-office that are equipped with workstations , telephones , and computers among other items that are shared by employees of multiple-agencies . part ii : military-service-members active military personnel active military personnel are considered to be on duty 24 hours a day . because the nature of some military-assignments makes a confirmation of the presence at duty-stations difficult , if not impossible , the recording of presence for duty and of specific hours during which duty is performed each day is not required . this is similar to exceptionbased t & a systems explained earlier in this document . most active-duty military personnel follow exceptionbased-systems . however , superiors are expected to be aware of the presence and absence of service-members for whom they are responsible . when a service-member is on temporary-assignment to another component of the armed-services or to a civilian-agency , the entity to which the service-member is detailed must provide time and attendance recording for the service-member and report the information to his or her home-component promptly to facilitate payment of basic-pay and allowances by ( or through ) the home-component . absence-reports must be maintained daily to indicate those service-members who are to be charged leave and those who are not present for duty but who should be . examples of reports that might contain such data are `` morning '' or `` day '' reports , strength-reports , unit-diaries , and other similar-reports . information on absences which affect pay should be compiled each pay-period and be transmitted to the payroll-system . without such information , the payroll-system may mistakenly pay the member for unauthorized-pay and allowances . the following-requirements for review and approval must be met : 1 . reports of such information and related supporting-documents must be reviewed and approved by a designated authorizing-official . the official must be aware of the responsibilities he or she is taking regarding the accuracy of the reports . 2 . approvals of such reports will be made at the end of the last day of the pay-period whenever possible . when this is not possible because of payroll-processing-requirements to meet established paydays , documents must be approved as close to the end of the pay-period as possible . 3 . approval must be done in accordance with guidance found in the subsection `` attestations , verifications , and approvals '' of section `` authorizing and approving t & a transactions '' of this document . 4 . any adjustments required because of changes in reported absences after the reports were approved and transmitted to the payroll-system must be made and reflected in the pay-period to which the changes apply , when possible , or when not possible , adjusted as soon as possible , preferably in the next-pay period . any changes must be approved by the authorizing-official prior to being entered into the payroll-system . service-members may not approve their own absence-reports unless prior-authority to do so is granted in writing by an authorized official . when feasible ( as in an office-setting or environment ) , costeffective , and applicable , attendance-reporting and related internal-controls set forth in `` part i : civilian-employees '' should be instituted for service-members to the extent-management-deems appropriate . military-reservists t & a controls for military-reservists depend largely on the nature of the work . if they have defined work-schedules and are not expected to be available for duty on a roundtheclock-basis , the t & a requirements for civilian-employees are operative and should be used . if however they are employed similar to those who are on active-duty or are actually on active-duty , then the controls in the subsection `` active military personnel '' are operative and should be used . appendix i : gao 's review of electronic-signatures applications gao has been asked by several federal-agencies to review electronic-signature-systems used in financial-management-systems and to discuss how such systems should be evaluated . because of some of the unique-risks associated with highly automated environments , traditional-data integrity techniques , such as password and user-identification based systems , used to authenticate an individual may not provide the same degree of assurance as that provided by paperbased-systems . for example , in a paperbased-system , an individual 's signature on the paper-document is a timetested-method of showing that an individual intended to be bound by the terms and conditions in the paper-document . however , in an electronic-world , where adequate-controls have not been implemented , the similar-approach of having an individual 's name appended to a data-record does not provide the same assurance because , for example , the terms and conditions can be changed without obtaining the individual 's approval of the changes made . when reviewing electronic-signature-systems , we evaluate whether a system generates electronic-signatures that represent an individual 's or an entity 's intent to be bound . to do this , we determine whether the electronic-signature-system provides reasonable-assurance that the signature produced by the system is ( 1 ) unique to the signer , ( 2 ) under the signer 's sole-control , ( 3 ) capable of being verified , and ( 4 ) linked to the data in such a manner that , if the data are changed , the signature is invalidated . adopting these criteria facilitates our evaluation of how well the electronic-signature-system addresses its threats and helps identify vulnerabilities that may be present in the system . we have also found these criteria useful since they are technology neutral ( can be used regardless of the technology used to produce the signature ) and allow for a variety of implementation-methods , depending of the degree of risk associated with a given application . when deciding on an electronic-signature-system for t & a data , agencies should identify and/or develop and document the criteria used in the selection of the signature-system and how the criteria and the selected system complies with the gpea definition of an electronic-signature . in addition , the agency 's risk-assessment-process ( as called for in the omb guidance14 ) should disclose the risks considered that would prevent the system from successfully complying with the criteria selected by the agency . without developing the criteria that the system should meet and then effectively assessing the risks , agencies could adopt signature-systems that will not provide the necessary-data integrity.15 ( 922289 ) 14 see footnote 10 . a recently issued gao report ( informationsecurity : seriousandwidespreadweaknessespersistat-federalagencies . gao/aimd00295 , september 6 , 2000 ) showed that in 24 agencies , physical and logical-access-controls were not effective in preventing or detecting-system-intrusions or misuse . these weaknesses have a significant adverse-impact on the ability of automated-systems to ensure the necessary-data-integrity . ordering-information the first copy of each gao report is free . additional-copies of reports are $ 2 each . a check or money-order should
