higher court-filing-fees could help fund legal-aid by deborah yetter sunday , december 29 , 2002 backers of legal-aid-services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court-filing-fees in kentucky to raise money for the program , which faces steep-funding-cuts . the proposed bill , sponsored by rep. charles geveden , d-wickliffe , would double the portion of the fee that goes to legal-aid -- in district-court to $ 10 from $ 5 and in circuit-court to $ 20 from $ 10 . kentucky 's current-fee for filing a case in district-court is $ 50.50 , and in circuit-court $ 108 . the increase still would leave kentucky 's filing-fee-costs below those of surrounding-states and would raise about $ 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what legal-aid is losing from federal and other sources , said jamie hamon , executive director of the access to justice foundation , a state poverty-law resource-center in lexington . geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential-source of money for the program , which is being forced to lay off workers and close-offices around the state . geveden said he 's concerned because federal-funding hasn't increased in recent years , and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money . ''if you do n't come up with the money somewhere , legal-services to people in need will diminish or go away , '' he said . hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors , and legal-aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative-session . hamon said she knows fee-increases are n't-popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis legal-aid is facing . ''a lot of poor-people are not going to get served , '' she said . the measure has the endorsement of the kentucky bar-association . the association 's board of governors voted unanimously-last month to back the bill , said kba president stephen catron , a bowling green lawyer . legal-aid ''has been a godsend to a great-number of people in this state , '' catron said . ''we simply must find a way to provide those services to the public . '' larry york , executive director of appalachian regional defense fund , which provides legal-aid-services in 37 eastern kentucky counties and is a kba-board-member , said he hopes the measure is approved . ''it would really offset the current-cuts , '' he said .
