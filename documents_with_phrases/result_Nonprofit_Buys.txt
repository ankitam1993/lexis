'justice center ' for county 's poor community : the group wants to share space with other agencies providing legal-help and basic-services . by jose cardenas times staff writer december 9 2001 california rural legal-assistance has purchased an oxnard building it had been renting since earlier this year , moving the provider of legal-services for ventura county 's poor closer to two goals . the purchase will help meet the organization 's long-term-plan of establishing a one-stop `` justice-center '' for agencies that provide services to the poor . it also will allow the organization to house in one building its migrant-worker legal-assistance-program and a newer basic-services program . the two programs are currently housed in buildings about a block apart . the organization 's oxnard-office broadened its services from farm worker-related-aid to basic-assistance last year when the federal government chose to fund it , over channel counties legal-services , as the county 's sole-provider of legal-help to the poor . the migrant-program generally has taken on issues related to farm-labor and has represented large-groups of workers . the basic program represents individuals on cases involving-labor , housing and claims for public-benefits . the purchase of the building on a street in downtown-oxnard also signals california rural legal-assistance 's intention to establish roots , said its leaders . `` to me , it symbolizes a long-term-presence in the community , '' said santos gomez , directing-attorney of the organization 's migrant services-office . `` we want the community to know that we are committed to try to address social-injustice . '' the building will be named the cruz reynoso justice-center . it will be the first building anywhere to be named after the first latino to serve on the california supreme court . naming the building after reynoso seemed appropriate because the former-justice came from a farm-worker-family that toiled in fields from orange county to the central valley , said jose padilla , the group 's statewide-director . `` it 's a great-honor to have a building dedicated to justice and to the service of the community . . . named after me , '' said reynoso , who is now a uc davis law-school professor . `` those are the issues i have devoted my life to . california rural legal-assistance has provided legal-services to farm-workers and other poor-people statewide for 35 years . its oxnard-office has provided services exclusively to farm-workers for more than a decade . the organization raised about $ 60,000 to purchase the a street building . half the money was raised from local-donors , including farm-workers . `` we wanted to show that we were a part of the community and that they were a part of us , '' padilla said . `` how do you develop ownership if not through a project that required local funding ? '' but the main-funding comes from a $ 650,000 loan the statewide organization took out . padilla said the organization plans to keep raising-money locally to help pay the mortgage . the building also houses five businesses that were already tenants . the organization 's migrant-program will move in , and the organization will spend the next year looking for nonprofit-groups or businesses to make up the rest of the justice-center . the idea is to bring together-organizations that provide services `` consistent with crla 's mission to alleviate poverty and to empower communities , '' said gomez . he has already begun contacting-groups that might be tenants . one example might be immigration-lawyers , a service that clients often need but that the organization does not provide , gomez said . padilla said the model of owning a building that functions as a one-stop legal-service-facility is a new endeavor for the organization . of the buildings that house its 20 regional-offices , the organization owns or co-owns five . if the model is successful in oxnard , it may be used at other california rural legal-assistance operations . `` i 'm hoping that what this center does is open a dialogue with other nonprofit-leaders to plan out what are the legal-needs of the community that could be served through such a center , '' padilla said . for information about reprinting this article , go to http : //www.lats.com/rights
