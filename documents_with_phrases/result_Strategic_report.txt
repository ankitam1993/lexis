legal-services corporation strategic-directions 2002-2005 2002 progress-report for programs introduction in my capacity as vice-president for programs , i am pleased and proud to provide to the lsc board of directors this third-progress report documenting the work of the programs staff at lsc - opp , oim and its consultants , and the staff of the vice-president for programs ( and her consultants ) -- in addressing the challenges placed before us in january 2000 by the lsc board of directors . in january 2000 , the lsc board of directors adopted a strategic-planning-document entitled strategic-directions 2000-2005 . this document established twin-goals to be attained by the national legal-services-community by 2004 : to dramatically increase the provision of legal-services to eligible-persons ; and to ensure that eligible-clients are receiving appropriate and high-quality legal-assistance . strategic-directions 2000-2005 also identified anticipated-outcomes , including : increased numbers of clients receiving legal-services appropriate to the legal-issues they encounter ; expanded relevancy of the delivery-system to the most pressing-needs of low-income-clients , with clients themselves taking a leading-role in this effort ; an expanded range and improvement in the quality of services provided by legal-services-programs ; and finally , greater-consistency in the quality of legal-services-programs . state-planning is identified in this board document as lsc 's key-strategy to achieve the goals stated above . because state-planning was identified as the board 's prime strategy for fulfilling the mandate of strategic-directions 2000-2005 , a brief-review of lsc 's state-planning-initiative is probably in order . lsc 's state-planning-initiative began in 1995 primarily in response to the programmatic-changes and budget-cuts that were threatening the very survival of legal-services-delivery across the nation . state-planning was built on the understanding that states and territories serve as the relevant geographic-areas of a planning-focus for developing-strategies to meet the civil equal-justice-needs of poor and vulnerable-people . several years later , in 1998 , state-planning became a key lsc strategy to achieve access and to improve the quality of services . lsc specifically announced its intent to put resources into the creation of comprehensive , coordinated , and integrated state legal-services-delivery systems in program-letters 98-1 and 98-6 . these program-letters declared that lsc was no longer limiting its focus on outcomes for clients within and by individual-programs , but rather it believed that quality legal-services could be delivered only in a statewide-context . it challenged each state to examine its organizational-structures , its use of technology , intake-systems , resource-development , and private-bar-involvement through a statewide-lens . in late 2000 - eleven months after the adoption of strategic-directions 2000-2005 - lsc issued its fourth-program-letter on state-planning that set forth expectations for each justice-community . these expectations , for purposes of brevity , can be summarized as follows : a delivery-system in which eligible-clients in every state are afforded an equal-opportunity to avail themselves and ultimately to attain high-quality civil legal-assistance . the lsc-programs staff have worked assiduously these past several years to help create a world-class national legal-services-delivery system in which eligible-clients in every state are afforded an equal-opportunity to avail themselves and ultimately to attain high-quality civil legal-assistance . however , as we moved to address the board 's mandate , we quickly realized that the creation of a world-class-delivery-system involved more than `` state-planning , '' per se . after all , we do not pursue state-planning because we are `` planners '' by education or trade-most of us , indeed , are first and foremost legal-services-attorneys and advocates . and we do not pursue state-planning because we love planning . we don't really love planning-at least most of us do not . we love legal-services and are committed to making legal-services better . and frankly , we do not pursue state-planning because we want our '' naysayers '' to believe that lsc has reformed itself . we pursue state-planning because we believe that our low-income-clients deserve the highest quality-service that can be made available to them despite our limited-funding . accordingly , in our quest to create world-class-justice-communities in each state and territory in this great-country , we began to focus on other initiatives that were , to us , just as important as state-planning to the creation of a delivery-system in which eligible-clients in every state are afforded an equal-opportunity to avail themselves and ultimately to attain high-quality civil legal-assistance . often refer to these initiatives as state-planning 's companion-initiatives , and these initiatives - competition , the quality-initiative , the diversity-initiative , technology-initiative-grants , the matters-initiative , our efforts to enhance services for self-represented-litigants , the legal resource library , to name just a few - have become as important to the creation of a world-class-delivery-system as state-planning has proved itself to be . these , companion-initiatives and the hardworking and talented-staff who carry out these initiatives , work-hand-in-glove with the equally well-qualified-state-planning team to promote the development of high quality , world-class-delivery-systems . in january 2000 , we issued our first progress-report to the lsc board of directors describing our efforts to help build premier justice-communities throughout our country . we issued our second report in january 2001 . in this third-report , we have decided to present our work to you in a fashion slightly-different from the format we have used in the past two reports . because we have learned over the years that premier-delivery-systems have two primary-legs upon which they ultimately stand or fall - healthy and vibrant lsc-funded-programs and healthy and vibrant-state-justice communities to which all lsc- funded-programs belong - we will present our work in this third-report in terms of our activities to promote healthy-programs and healthy state-justice-communities . we believe this format will provide the lsc board of directors a complete and true-picture of the work we pursued in 2002 to build legal-services-delivery system in which no eligible-client is turned away , and in which every eligible-client is provided high quality legal-services . we thank the lsc board of directors for giving us this opportunity to present our work . more importantly , we thank the lsc board of directors for giving us the opportunity to improve a legal-services-delivery system that is so valuable to our clients , so essential to a democratic way of life , and so very important to all of us . the legal-services corporation exists to help our clients address their legal-wrongs and promote their legal-rights . to the extent that we have been given the opportunity to participate fully in addressing this important and primary-mission of lsc , we have been truly-fortunate . i . structural-changes in the delivery-system since 1998 , lsc has initiated and overseen significant structural-changes in the number and configuration of lsc-funded-programs in order to develop more powerful and effective-state delivery-systems . the office of program-performance ( opp ) staff have assisted lsc grantees and state-justice-communities with this change-process in a number of ways , including the provision of significant technical-assistance to help with planning and implementation . in 2002 , lsc made $ 60,000 available to help six states develop effective-plans and $ 130,000 to assist nine states institute new delivery-structures . significant-staff-resources also have been devoted to on-site-visits and to sharing-information and best-practices , targeting-programs undergoing-consolidation . planning for change • technical-assistance for planning . in 2002 , lsc gave technical-assistance to alabama , arkansas , mississippi , missouri , montana , and new york , enabling these six states to obtain important-consulting and facilitative-assistance with configuration and overall-planning . • configuration-changes . nine states completed configuration-planning in 2002 and submitted-proposals for significant structural-change , with completion-dates in 2003 and 2004 . each of these states received lsc planning-assistance-funds . configuration-planning commenced in another six states . changes effective in 2003 • iowa . iowa will become one statewide-service-area . the legal-services corporation of iowa , which serves 98 of iowa 's 99 counties , has absorbed the assets of the single-county polk county program and changed its name to iowa legal-aid , reflecting its expanded service-area . • michigan . after years of effort , 10 basic-field-service areas have been consolidated into five . the new configuration improves opportunities to increase resources and access and achieve greater equity in client-service . • new jersey . the state 's 14-service-areas have been consolidated into a much more manageable six . one of our most highly integrated and comprehensive-delivery-systems , new jersey is now poised to deliver even better services to low-income-persons . • north dakota . two separate native american service-areas and two basic-field-service areas have been combined into one native american area and one basic field area , and a grant for both made to a single-program . this will yield more geographically equitable-service , especially for native american-clients . changes effective in 2004 • florida . twelve lsc-funded-service-areas have been combined into seven regions . under florida 's plan , which was accepted by lsc this summer , the lsc-funded-programs will continue to anchor the delivery-system and provide the lion 's share of basic legal-services to low-income-residents . • new york . the new york plan , also accepted by lsc this summer , reduces the state 's 14-service-areas to seven . by combining many of the smaller service-areas , the new configuration establishes a sturdier platform for client-services and the future growth of new york 's equal-justice-system . • alabama . alabama has just submitted its plan to consolidate three service-areas into a statewide-program . planners believe this will improve coordination of resources with lsc and non-lsc-programs , and assure uniform-delivery of services to clients throughout the state . • missouri . missouri 's legal-services commission , with appointees from the state supreme court and missouri bar , recommended consolidation of the state 's lsc service-areas into one lsc-funded-program , beginning in 2004 . • mississippi . after a year of planning , mississippi has committed to producing a reconfiguration-proposal by january 15 , 2003 . future-changes • massachusetts , minnesota , ohio , oregon , puerto rico , and south dakota . these five states and one territory received-notices of configuration-concern from lsc in 2002 . nearly all have experienced structural-changes in their delivery-systems since 1995 . now each will embark on a review of the efficacy of current-configuration patterns , and report to lsc on their studies in 2003 . implementing-change • assistance to merging-programs . lsc staff give substantial-assistance to merging-programs . in 2002 , programs merged or prepared for merger in iowa , louisiana , new jersey , north dakota , wisconsin , texas , and new mexico . our efforts with these programs varied depending on need . we wrote-checklists of merger-issues to consider during the merger-process and shared-model documents developed by other programs . when asked , lsc made available-information on consultants with special-expertise in merging-non-profit-entities . we referred-programs to peers that had successfully addressed similar-merger-challenges . over and above assisting with the technical-aspects of merger , we helped-programs resolve issues that interfered with creating and maintaining a comprehensive integrated-delivery-system in the reconfigured-service-area . • special-grant-conditions for programs that merged in 2002 . our special-grant-conditions required periodic-submission of written progress-reports on achieving a comprehensive integrated-delivery-system . programs in california , illinois , kentucky , louisiana , michigan , mississippi , north and south carolina , south dakota , tennessee , texas and virginia received special-grant-conditions . in many instances , lsc staff responded to their reports with written feedback . • technical-assistance to assist with consolidations . in 2002 , lsc gave $ 130,000 in merger technical-assistance to nine states : arkansas , iowa , louisiana , new mexico , north carolina , south dakota , tennessee , texas and west virginia . this money underwrote-assistance for technology ; leadership and team-building ; labor-relations , including-salaries , benefits , pensions and revised personnel-policies ; fund-balances ; due diligence and other merger-related legal-work ; office-space and insurance ; planning-committee efforts ; changes in intake , hotlines and case-management-systems ; and other consolidation-issues . in two states , our funds helped-leverage new resources . ii . quality improvement at the core of powerful and effective-delivery-systems are high quality legal-services-programs . opp staff-work with grantees to enhance the quality of their work through ongoing-contact , through lsc 's library resource initiative ( see section iv ) , and through program-visits . program-visits allow staff to monitor program developments , to learn about problems , and to develop new strategies for expanding-access and enhancing-quality . on-site-reviews take a number of forms . technical-assistance visits are conducted after lsc receives a request from a program for assistance in a particular-area such as intake-systems , legal-work-management and supervision , or technology . program-inquiry-visits are designed to gather information and to give lsc additional-knowledge about programs that have not been visited recently . program-inquiry-visits also occur when lsc staff believe that certain-challenges facing the program need lsc 's attention . tig visits are made to technology-initiative-grant ( tig ) recipients . ( in 2002 , we visited-programs that received tig-funding in 2000 and 2001 to review technology-progress under the grant . ) finally , post-reconfiguration-visits occur two years after a service-area has been reconfigured to assess how well the program is serving the new service-area and the extent to which the restructured-organization is operating cohesively . opp conducted 14 on-site-visits in 2002 . all fourteen visits lasted several days ( one required 10-business-days due to the size and location of the program ) , and involved two to five persons . consultants sometimes served as team-members , and often opp technology-staff joined-teams to lend their special-expertise . • program-inquiry-visits . occurred in oklahoma , new york , wisconsin , delaware , and wyoming . in addition , program-inquiry-visits conducted in combination with state-planning-visits took place in the district of columbia , alaska , kansas , and hawaii . • post-reconfiguration-visits . occurred in california , colorado , and arizona . • technical-assistance visits . we responded to requests from programs in arkansas and maryland for technical-assistance visits . • tig visits . in addition to the 14 on-site-program-quality reviews , opp technology-staff visited our 2000 and 2001 technology-initiative-grant ( tig ) recipients in indiana , south carolina , pennsylvania , mississippi , illinois , and tennessee . iii . diversity , leadership and inclusion early in 2002 , lsc invited a small group of national-leaders with a deep-interest in promoting multicultural-diversity to advise lsc on how best to help grantees reach their diversity-goals . the advisory-committee 's preeminent-project was to help create and produce a training-tool on leadership and diversity for program-boards and managers . this resource was completed in november 2002 . in 2002 , lsc acted on several other items listed in its action-agenda on diversity , a summary of ideas and suggestions raised in lsc 's 2001 national-conversations on diversity . • board training module on leadership and diversity this resource is intended to assist programs with diversity-initiatives and guide grantee-board and management-discussions on the importance of diversity in providing-high-quality and appropriate-services to clients . it can be used in conjunction with regular-board-trainings or as a stand-alone-device . leadership and diversity : the link that promotes effective-delivery of legal-services was tested with good-results at two sites - a statewide-program in the northeast and a large southwestern-program . early in 2003 , the module will be given to every lsc-funded-program . we anticipate that the module will increase commitment to building a multi-culturally competent-staff and services that reflect the diverse-backgrounds of client-communities by engaging-boards in candid-conversations and exercises on fostering-inclusion , cultivating new leadership , and expanding-diversity-parameters in their programs . program-staff research , ( explained below in collecting diversity data ) , indicates that many program-boards and managers need to reemphasize diversity in staff-recruitment , promotion , and strategies to reach overlooked client-groups . • education and outreach southeast project-directors association . lsc organized a well-received-panel at the sepda conference to showcase how well two state-communities of justice and two programs used reconfiguration-activities to expand diversity within staff and volunteer-ranks , and for instituting programmatic-measures that will generate a new cadre of leaders in the legal-services-community . virginia annual legal-aid conference . at this statewide-training event , we joined a panel that addressed how legal-services-programs and equal-justice-communities can effectively-recruit and retain a diverse-work-force , among other critical-diversity-activities . later in 2002 , building on this panel , the virginia state-planning assembly began creating an action-plan of goals for obtaining diverse-staff and boards , growing a diverse-corps of leaders and deeper engagement with the client-community . other public-forums . vice-president for programs randi youells repeatedly highlighted-diversity 's essential-role in a healthy and effective legal-services-system in talks she gave throughout the year to program-staff , civil-justice-leaders , and state-justice-communities . in this way , the lsc diversity-message was delivered locally in states like arizona and montana , and nationally through articles in the mie journal and nlada update . she promoted diversity in speeches she was invited to give to partner organizations - the combined conference of state-court judges and conference of state-court administrators , the international legal-aid-group and through the ontario ( canada ) legal-aid speakers series . our commitment to a nuanced-approach to diversity was apparent in each meeting of the lsc board provisions committee as staff regularly reported on activities in this area , and presenters invited from our programs reflected the importance of inclusion in the topics they addressed and in the communities they represented . • leadership mentoring efforts responding to a concern raised at lsc 's 2002 conference for directors of statewide-programs , we designed a pilot-mentoring project for new statewide-program executive-directors . in its initial-phase , the project matched two new statewide-program directors with an experienced one . the three convened at each other 's programs and over the telephone to explore topics such as executive-leadership , managing-change , and state-planning in states with one lsc grantee . • collecting diversity data through the competition-process . through its competitive-grant process , lsc obtains and reviews substantial-data on an applicant's capacity to respond to a diverse-client-community . using this information , lsc can learn how each applicant proposes to diminish client-access-barriers including cultural , geographic , and language-barriers ; how the applicant will engage clients with access-barriers ; the racial , ethnic and gender-distribution of the applicant 's staff ; strategies used to recruit , retain , and promote diverse-staff ; training-events that address diversity ; and how the organization is building-leadership that is diverse . using case-service-reports . csr 's , which grantees are required to submit annually to lsc , contain data on program-staff as well as on cases closed during a calendar year . early in 2002 , we reported on our examination of 1996-2000 data on gender and race of executive-directors of lsc-funded-programs . we discovered that reconfiguration , within the confines of state-planning , did not diminish the percent of minorities and women in leadership-positions in our programs . we saw that , despite vigorous-efforts to increase diversity in state-justice-communities and particularly in leadership-positions , the ethnic-profiles of our executive-directors remained virtually-unchanged , and the number of women directors was significantly lower than their percentage in the attorney-workforce . later in 2002 , we were able to study the 2001 data . these indicated that the number of directors of color rose from 16 percent to 21 percent of the director-population . unfortunately , the data also showed that the number of women directors continues to lag behind their increasing-presence in our grantees ' attorney-ranks . iv . identifying and sharing best-practices legal-services-programs often pioneer creative-responses to the challenge of high quality , effective-services for clients . at lsc , we are frequently impressed with the range of novel-approaches that practitioners have devised . in october 2002 , we launched the lsc resource library initiative ( lri ) , a website committed to ensuring that lsc-programs are aware of and have access to innovations in civil legal-services-work . the project is dedicated to raising the standard of practice in legal-services-programs by encouraging the cross-fertilization of innovative-practices through facilitating the voluntary-exchange of exemplary-practices . lri showcases a variety of original and effective-activities ranging from how to conduct a comprehensive strategic-planning-process to new ideas for serving-hard-to-reach populations . ten weeks after opp launched lri , site-activity reports showed that users had viewed approximately 15,500 pages . lri is available-online at www.lri.lsc.gov . v. managing-information to improve grants administration and program-quality lsc 's office of information-management ( oim ) along with opp recently launched the electronic grants award letter ( egal ) system . this initiative permits lsc to distribute grant-award-letters electronically from a secure-website . egal 's benefits include an electronic-archive of competitive-grant-contracts , immediate-access to digital grant-award documents , reduction in administrative-cost , and faster and more efficient-transmittal of information to grantees . similarly , oim revised the electronic grant renewal application to accommodate new information sought by lsc and to ensure greater ease for users . during 2002 , oim obtained the 2000 census-figures , at state and county-levels , and devoted substantial-time to calculating-poverty population for each of our grantees ' service-areas under these new figures . this information was supplied to all grantees and will be the basis of our grant-awards for the next decade . lsc is committed to providing the united states congress and the public with the most accurate-information possible . closed-case-statistics form a major-component of the program-activity-data collected by lsc , and are a critical-measure of the impact of federal-funding on the legal-problems of people living in poverty . therefore , it is essential to assure the accuracy of the csr-data . each year , oim staff assists our grantees in verifying the reporting of csr-data through the annual-self-inspection process . the purpose of the self-inspection-process is to give our grantees a means to ensure that their csr-data meet lsc standards for accuracy . in january of each year , lsc distributes a case review form . the form contains a list of questions that identify key-requirements that need to be met in order to report a case to lsc . grantees statistically `` sample '' the cases closed in the previous year to determine if the `` sampled '' cases generally meet the requirements for reporting-cases to lsc . if ten percent or more of the cases sampled in the self-inspection-process have problems , then lsc assumes that there are overall-problems within the grantee 's case closing-records , which may affect the accuracy of the csr-data . in the event that the selfinspection-process does reveal problems , grantees are asked to consult with lsc to determine the appropriate-corrective action . all grantees are required to submit their self-inspection-certification and summary forms to lsc in march of each year for the previous year . the information is turned over to lsc 's office of compliance and enforcement , which is responsible for monitoring the accuracy of the csr system and csr-data . vi . technology strategic-directions 2000-2005 identifies technology as a primary-strategy for enhancing-client-access to services . we have observed that many more clients receive some assistance when technologically sophisticated-intake-systems are installed . computerized and web-based-self-help-programs make high quality-information available to those who would be denied aid because of resource-limitations and case-acceptance-criteria . technology-innovations can improve full-representation through quicker legal-research and information-gathering-capacities . finally , stronger technology-systems allow a program 's staff to experience more effective-supervision and coordination . the technology-initiative-grant program ( tig ) is lsc 's most powerful-tool to help-programs ramp up existing-technology-systems . in 2002 , 55 tig awards were granted . the improvements and projects they funded are discussed below ( see section vii . training , section ix . pro se enhancement , section xi . pro-bono enhancement , and section xii . intake-enhancement ) . the technology initiatives grant program lsc received 98-grant-applications for the 2002 tig-funding . screening them required seven-review-sessions with outside-panels , internal-review-sessions , and special-sessions with opp staff to analyze how the applications affected-program-quality and state-planning concerns . staff-recommendations went first to vice-president randi youells and then to president erlenborn for final funding-decisions . lsc 's 55 tig grants totaled $ 4.4 million . they foster our objective of improving-access to justice for clients . for example , the grants will allow : • alaska to install computers in six courthouses with access to legal-information and self-help-materials on the statewide-legal services website . • guam to put 21 computers in the village-mayors ' offices , with access to legal-information and self-help-materials that are mounted on a new statewide-website . • maryland to create a web-based pro se litigant-support system for some of the 24 court-funded assisted pro se programs . users will be able to view their own personal-web-pages as '' personal case account managers , '' and resource their files . in development is information about a panel of attorneys to provide '' unbundled '' services and mediators who offer free-services to pro se litigants . • orange county , california to expand the i-can ! ( interactive community assistance network ) services to include an earned income credit module . low-income-workers will be able to complete the schedule eic and related-tax-forms , and file them electronically . the internal revenue service is a partner in this project . • washington state to support their joint courts/legal services-planning for the effective-utilization of technology-resources for self-represented-litigants expanding on earlier grants for statewide-websites , lsc made 12 new awards , bringing the total number of states that are building and maintaining statewide-websites to more than 40 . these sites enable a state 's residents to benefit from centrally maintained and up-to-date-resources for legal-information and self-help-materials . vii . training many areas of poverty-law are highly specialized . to ensure top quality-representation , legal-workers need ongoing-training in new and complex-areas of law . low-levels of funding and the absence of state , regional and national poverty training-materials and teachers can diminish opportunities for staff-education on substantive poverty-law-issues . through the competition-process , our work with state-justice-communities and with tig-funding , lsc helps grantees meet critical-training-needs . in 2002 , we designed several new approaches . new lawyer training project pursuant to a contract with the national center on poverty-law , ncpl held-training-events at nine sites nationally on conducting poverty-law-research via the internet and other webbased-tools . the training was structured to allow participants to subsequently train colleagues who did not attend the sessions . these events were so popular that ncpl replicated them at new sites , not funded under the lsc contract . the lsc contract required ncpl to produce a 250-page poverty-law manual that introduces advocates to the fundamentals of poverty-law . a hard-copy of this manual was distributed to all new legal-services-attorneys in the country . it is available electronically at ncpl 's website . technology-grants focused on training two 2002 tig awards focus on training . in one , legal-services law line of vermont , inc. will make nationally available-on-line the core-curriculum of the legal-services training-consortium of new england , and provide a platform for other legal-services-organizations to obtain distance learning-opportunities , allowing advocates to get skills-training without the usual financial and travel-costs . in the second , legal-aid society of orange county will create a national-technology-training and curriculum-project to build capacity across many audiences within the legal-services-community . this will extend the implementation of model-technology innovations that improve justice for low-income-clients . technology technical-assistance days of service opp staff offer hands-on-technology-training by building on national legal-services-events . one example is our `` day of service . '' this project is supported by our tig-funds and is organized by the national technology assistance project ( ntap ) . a day of service occurs on the day before the opening of a national-conference . the technology-staffs of all the programs attending the conference ( including opp staff ) convene the day before the conference begins to lend technical-expertise to the legal-services-program in the host-city . days of service have benefited legal-aid society of cleveland ( in conjunction with the aba/nlada equal-justice-conference ) , legal action of wisconsin ( prior to the nlada annual-meeting ) , and greater orlando area legal-services ( in conjunction with the nonprofit technology enterprise network ( n-ten ) conference ) . another innovative-project that is held on conjunction with national legal-services-meetings is our cyber café . in 2002 , we hosted a cyber café at both the nlada annual-meeting and at the equal-justice-conference to give internet access to conference-participants , allowing them to check their email . our cyber café also allows technology-staff from around the country to demonstrate new software and discuss technology-resources with conferees . viii . measurement and evaluation it is crucial to the strategic-planning-process to measure the volume of our grantees ' work and to evaluate the success of their approaches . to this end , opp has built systems for determining the effectiveness of our strategic-initiatives . described below are measures we have been refining over the past year to capture information on the effects of state-planning , the amount and type of service that programs give , client-outcomes , program-delivery systems , and the impact on services of our technology-grants . state-justice-communities planning-initiative evaluation instrument in order to insure the highest quality and maximum-level of services to potentially-eligible clients in each state , and so that the goal of meeting those needs will be realized , lsc has developed the state-justice-communities planning-initiative evaluation instrument . a design-team of 14 representatives from the legal-services-community - including-providers , clients , courts and other stakeholder-entities - worked assiduously over the year to produce a tool that will be tested in 2003 , revised-pursuant to that process , and ultimately used nationally . the instrument is designed to assess the health and vibrancy of each state-justice community/state legal-services-delivery system , establish benchmarks against which further progress can be measured , and begin to gather data to allow comparisons of state-justice-communities . state-planning self evaluation-process pending-implementation of the state-planning evaluation instrument , lsc responded to and engaged state-justice-communities around the self-evaluations-reports they sent in pursuant to program-letter 2000-07 . our feedback-focus is on the relationship between the structure of a delivery-system and its capacity to provide client-access to a full-range of services no matter where in the state the client resides , while at the same time anticipating and providing for clients ' emerging legal-needs and aspirations . analyses of case closing data program-staff from the office of information-management reviewed case-service-reports ( csr ) for 1991 through 2000 to discern trends in the types and numbers of cases closed by grantees . their analysis revealed that most programs experienced declines in cases closed during periods of dramatic-funding-reductions and before they ( with and without lsc assistance ) aggressively sought other forms of funding ( e.g. , mid-1990 's ) . in spite of a diminution in cases closed , however , programs showed remarkable-stability in the kinds of cases they reported . the data indicate correlations between the number of brief-service and/or counsel and advice-cases closed and the institution of telephone-intake-systems . they also show that the percentage of extended-service-cases also grew , demonstrating that lsc grantees continue to vigorously represent clients in the more traditional-forums of administrative-hearings , mediations , and trial and appellate-courts even as they institute innovative full-service-intake-systems . our study , reported nationally by randi youells at the conference of state-court judges and conference of state-court administrators , also vividly illustrated what we do not know about our grantees ' work - the difference it makes in clients ' lives and how it has benefited the community . measurement of services-programs provide in addition to cases some low-income-persons who seek assistance at lsc-programs need only legal-information , guidance with self-representation or a referral to an organization more appropriate to their needs . lsc has stressed the merit of these limited-services though several strategies , including-technology-grants to support statewide-websites , lri to share innovative-practices , and state-planning requirements that touch on pro se assistance , community legal-education and similar-services . the matters reports allow opp , for the first time , to learn about the type and volume of grantee-work that does not constitute '' cases . '' these activities include community legal-education , some forms of pro se assistance , referrals , outreach , indirect-services including-training to non-legal-advocates who help low-income-people , and other services , including-mediation and alternative-dispute-resolution . although we collected-data on matters work undertaken during the last six months of 2001 , we were not able to analyze and report on them to the lsc board and on our website until 2002 . more than two million people received significant-matters-services from grantees in the second half of 2001 . all but one of the programs provided community legal-education , 89 percent engaged in outreach-activities , and 75 percent disseminated pro se information . grantees reported providing referral-information to more than 530,000 people . the importance of matters-services to the low-income-community is demonstrated in our report , which also includes summaries of innovative-approaches that have allowed grantees to offer clients-services that do not fall into the '' cases '' category , but are nonetheless-significant . the matters-report is at http : //www.lsc.gov/websitedocs/mr080802.pdf . measurement of outcomes development of an outcome-measures reporting-system to supplement or replace lsc 's csr system is underway . in 2002 , lsc posted a request for information in the federal register , as the first step to issuing a request for proposals to develop an outcome-measurement system . in late 2002 , lsc hired an experienced consultant to study and report on existing-systems in the legal-services-community and make recommendations on approaches lsc could adopt . measurement of quality through quality-review-visits lsc expanded its on-site-program-reviews to include internal protocols for visiting recently merged-programs and for evaluating a program 's closed-case-statistics . the purpose of the former is to learn whether all elements of a newly merged program are functioning cohesively , and to identify areas where technical-assistance may help achieve a unified-operation . protocols on closed-cases will ensure the consistent-application of our analysis factors . both new protocols will be used by staff and consultants who review programs and in their reports and recommendations based on the reviews . measurement of quality through the grant-application process through the competitive-grants-process , lsc evaluates an applicant 's capacity to provide effective and efficient high quality legal-representation to eligible-clients . assessments also are made of an applicant 's participation in an integrated-delivery-system that seeks to make the most efficient-use of all resources , strives for innovations in delivery-mechanisms and creatively involves the private-bar . criteria and standards used to measure the strength of a legal-services-delivery network are derived from the lsc act and regulations , lsc performance criteria , american bar-association ( aba ) standards for programs providing civil pro-bono legal-services to persons of limited means , and aba standards for providers of civil legal-services to the poor . recently , lsc examined its competitive-grants-process , through a series of discussions , and surveys and interviews with consultants , lsc grantees and staff , to determine its effectiveness in measuring an applicant 's capacity to provide high quality , client-centered legal-services . the results demonstrated that our process is a useful and effective-tool for assessing the quality of legal-services-delivery . suggestions on how to improve the current-process were implemented and , as a result , lsc will be sending feedback-letters to applicants that filed-grant-proposals for 2003 funding to begin a dialogue about the applicant 's delivery-system based on the grant-application . additionally , our request for proposals now encourages applicants to describe the quality of their delivery-approach , the unique-features of their service-area and any model-projects . the evaluation of technology-projects tig-funds support the technology evaluation project , an initiative of the legal-aid society of cincinnati . the project creates evaluation-instruments for statewide-websites , also supported by tig awards . created over the course of the year , the tools were distributed to programs for comment at the end of 2002 . user-feedback is expected early in 2003 , after which the tools will be modified if necessary and distributed . when perfected , the tools will allow programs to evaluate their technology-projects during implementation-phases to both assure successful-completion and , ultimately , to determine whether their goals were achieved . ix . pro se enhancement one of the best ways to help the approximately 80 percent of low-income-persons who need legal-assistance but must do without , is to arm self-represented-litigants with quality-information and assistance . lsc does this in two ways . one is by giving-self-help assistance directly through our programs ( such as with the i-can system and the statewide-websites ) and the second is by enhancing existing-efforts on behalf of pro se clients . tig pro se efforts this year , tig made 40 grants that directly touch on pro se . eighteen were website-renewal-grants to statewide-websites begun in previous years . thirteen were for new statewide-websites . an additional nine were for other pro se projects . one put self-help computers in each of guam 's 21 mayors ' community-offices ; another put self-help-stations in six remote-courthouses in alaska . a third , made to atlanta legal-aid ( partnering with georgia legal-services ) , built on earlier efforts by aarp and created self-help offices ( sho ) for an urban-setting ( atlanta ) and a rural-setting ( a mobile-office that will move from community to community ) . tig staff presented the tig-funded i-can project from orange county , california to the virginia court-system . we also organized a conference on document-assembly-software in new york city . at that event , legal-services-personnel , court-personnel , and other technology-experts saw-demonstrations by four companies on their products , and assessed their utility for preparing pro se documents . after weighing the options , we arranged for a donation from lexis of their hotdocs document-assembly-software for each state , which will greatly enhance the availability of legal-forms that lay-people can easily fill out online . recognizing that self-represented-litigants are a challenge for court-systems , lsc has collaborated with the national center for state-courts , the state-justice institute , the american judicature society , pro-bono net , and zorza associates to create a website resource-center for professionals involved in self-help-projects . this is one of several-endeavors by an ad hoc pro se group that has continued to work jointly on enhancements for pro se since it was first organized , in 2000 at lsc 's charter tig conference . in june , at the annual conference of chief justices-conference of state-court administrators , lsc held two sessions on successful-self-help initiatives , and met informally with judges and administrators to examine potential and existing pro se partnerships between civil-court systems and legal-services-programs . x . resource-development substantial new resources are essential to increased-access to and availability of services to low-income-persons . level lsc-funding , census-related-cuts in many program-budgets , downturns in iolta and state-government-revenues made this past year one where lsc support for resource-development was essential to the vitality of programs and state-justice-communities . in 2002 , lsc continued to offer technical-assistance to lower funded-states to increase resources . for example , our funds made it possible for louisiana to adopt a multi-year-development-plan , and allowed west virginia to launch a three-year private-bar-campaign that secured almost $ 300,000 in contributions and pledges prior to kickoff , with the expectation of reaching its goal of $ 1.2 million . collaborative-efforts also are yielding-gains in other states . • pennsylvania civil-justice-community stakeholders joined to bring about passage of a filing-fee surcharge law that will ultimately give about $ 7.6 million of annual-funding for civil legal-aid . • delaware state-planners collaborated on an endowment-fund that will provide longterm-support for legal-services . it was made possible by delaware 's combined campaign for justice , a coordinated fundraising-effort by the state-planning-committee sponsored by the delaware state-bar-association and other justice-community stakeholders . • in virginia , state-planners were able to increase filing-fee funding by 50 percent and , through the statewide-funding planning-team , created a statewide-funding action-plan adopted by the virginia statewide-planning assembly . xi . pro-bono enhancement one of the most powerful-ways to expand client-services and support for providers is to engage the private-bar in poverty-law activities . historically two barriers have interfered with broad participation in pro-bono-projects . one is that few lawyers are experienced in poverty-law and most are reluctant - without support and assistance - to handle such cases . second , many private practitioners are unwilling to take a case when the effort it will require is not clearly set forth at the outset . fortunately , many of these lawyers are willing and able to help in other ways . websites early-indications are that pro-bono-websites have the potential to address the expertise-gap . as currently utilized , a pro-bono website has two chief-functions . one is to list cases and projects that will benefit from private-attorney-involvement . the second is to provide resources relevant to the cases and projects listed on the website by making available-materials ( such as forms and briefing-information ) relevant to the cases listed on the website and electronic-access to experts who will assist the pro-bono attorney . the first function acts as a forum for finding-volunteers for such activities as consulting on cases , handling economic development-transactions or working on intake-systems . the second website-function supports volunteers who are uncomfortable in a new area of law and need guidance and direction . special-communities lsc administers the grant for the veterans consortium pro-bono program to make available high quality free legal-assistance to litigants before the u.s. court of appeals for veterans claims who can not afford the cost of representation . this year through the competitive-grants-process , lsc awarded a four-year-grant to the veterans pro-bono consortium , a national-organization that assists veterans with their appeals-process by linking them with pro-bono attorneys . tig initiatives in each of the statewide-websites supported by tig-funds , there is or soon will be a section committed to pro-bono attorneys . the section is modeled after probono.net in new york city , a popular resource that contains substantial-information on areas of law relevant to pro-bono-projects , a calendar for cle events and forms through which volunteers can pose questions to experts , among other tools . pro-bono attorneys are a valuable-asset for low-income-people who have legal-problems . we want to sustain and grow private-attorney engagement by giving-volunteers the necessary-tools and support . and website pro-bono sections are essential to doing so . xii . intake-enhancement efficient-intake-systems not only screen clients for eligibility but also give advice , brief-service and referral-assistance to those who can not be fully represented . used well , intake-systems offer the promise of increasing-assistance to many who are not currently served . lsc staff were struck by the many innovative systems used across the country . in 2002 , we took the steps to encourage their growth and improvement through a program-letter outlining what we believe to be model-intake-practices . we also added review of and feedback on intake-systems to all of our quality-review-visits , and , through our technology-grants , we made it possible for programs to improve their own systems using the experiences of peers . lsc 's program-letter on intake our program-letter on the characteristics of a telephone-intake , advice and referral-system sets out the attributes of a superb system for grantees to both inform the field and create a set of standards lsc can use during on-site-visits and for evaluating grant-applications . intrinsic to the development of the program-letter , was the input we solicited on exemplary-systems from individuals and organizations with special-knowledge or experience about the topic . intake as a critical-component of quality-review-visits intake-systems are examined during our on-site-program-quality visits . in 2002 , recommendations and requirements issued in the wake of our visits led several-programs to substantially modify their intake-procedures . one program was told to restructure its capacity for telephone-advice and brief-service so that clients would not have to personally come to the office for an intake interview . we strongly encouraged another program to adopt program-wide-intake-protocols that would make case-handling consistent among all offices . tig grants enhancing-intake before a low-income-person can receive appropriate legal-assistance , that individual has to gain access to legal-services-system . lsc promotes the use of technology to remove barriers to access by establishing seamless-intake-systems that cover an entire-state . several 2002 tig awards , now well underway , targeted-intake systems . in virginia , callers to the statewide-toll free-number now are not only routed to an intake-worker in the program serving their area , but can hear informative-recordings on relevant legal topics twenty-four hours a day , in english and spanish . building on last year 's grant , the tig 2002 award to potomac legal-aid society ( plas ) allows the program to reach the area's underserved asian american-community . the asp database-program will enable the asian pacific american legal resource-center ( apalrc ) to conduct client-intake at their offices of mono-lingual asian american-clients , and then transfer eligibility and case-data over the internet to plas if the client-needs brief legal-advice , or to lsnv for extended-representation . interpreters will be provided by apalrc . a tig award to the northwest justice project ( washington ) streamlines-case-referral from clear ( the state 's telephone-intake program ) to the state 's other legal-services-providers . instead of printing out intake-forms and faxing them to the other providers , who then must manually enter the data into their systems , intake information will be transferred electronically from one system to the other . the result is an extraordinary-savings in staff-time and has become a model for other intake-systems . xiii . promoting the development of effective legal-services in 2002 , lsc also relied on a broader national-platform and collaborations with national-partners to underline the centrality of new and more effective-strategies to expand access and availability of legal-services . • lsc vice-president for programs randi youells tirelessly promoted our message of vigorous and effective-justice-communities that serve clients across a given state no matter what cultural , geographic or linguistic-barriers interfere with their access . she traveled to meetings with local , regional and state-grantees , participated in access to justice-conferences and responded to international-invitations to address legal-aid-groups . highpoints of her peripatetic-proselytizing in 2002 were : o access to justice-conference in montana o community legal-services 50th-year-anniversary ( arizona ) o southeast project-directors association conference ( new orleans ) o nlada mid-year and annual-meetings o native american lsc-funded-programs meeting ( milwaukee ) o bay area legal-services ( tampa ) o puerto rico access to justice meeting o conference of state-court justice and state-court administrators ( maine ) o ontario legal-aid speakers series ( canada ) o international legal-aid-group ( tokyo ) o bellow-sacks symposium on self-represented-litigants ( boston ) o tig conference ( chicago ) o access to justice meeting ( new york city ) • lsc held a conference on building-state-justice communities for executive-directors of state and territory-wide recipient-programs . our goal was to focus executive-directors on the fundamentals of planning for client-centered , comprehensive , integrated statewide-justice-communities . we convened the executive-leadership from newly created statewide lsc-funded-programs and the experienced-leadership of the more historical statewide-programs to share-observations on challenges and opportunities created by state-planning . thirty-one-program-representatives attended , and every statewide lsc-funded-program but one was represented . also represented were our grantees in puerto rico , guam and virgin islands programs . • lsc held its rural-issues and delivery-symposium in nebraska last-fall . lsc vice-president for programs randi youells and lsc board member maria luisa mercado opened the three-day symposium by challenging-conferees to help lsc develop practices and policies that guarantee high quality legal-services to rural people - whether they are california farm-workers , small-farmers in the midwest , migrant-workers in the south , or native americans on reservations in the southwest . conferees ' answers to four questions ( how to build collaborative-relationships in rural-environments ; how to balance resources between urban and rural-communities ; how to achieve world-class-delivery-systems for rural-clients ; and how to expand resources for rural-delivery ) led to a list of broad recommendations for lsc and the legal-services-community , with particular-emphasis on the development of a national-voice for rural legal-services . • lsc joined aarp and management-information exchange ( mie ) to host `` innovations in civil legal-services , '' a workshop at the nlada annual conference in milwaukee to showcase best-practices in the effective-delivery of civil legal-services to low-income-people . we highlighted qualitative-improvements in current structures along with innovative-approaches to reaching hard-to-reach-groups traditionally overlooked by providers . these exemplary-practices also were posted on the lsc resource library initiative website ( lri ) , ensuring easy and public-access to information about them . • among the tig staff-presentations at the 2002 equal-justice-conference was the session highlighting several tig projects in final-implementation-stage . two projects were presented : the ohio statewide-website ( www.ohiolegalservices.org ) that became the national-kaivo-template , and the ohio domestic-violence resource-center ( www.ohiodvresources.org ) , a website containing document creation software and replete with information specific to victims of domestic-violence . the presentation also covered hawaii 's use of videoconferencing to serve clients , new jersey 's voice over ip ( voip ) technology , and iowa 's computer-guide for lowincome-residents . • tig staff responded to a request from jeanne charn , director of the hale and dorr legal-services center at harvard law-school , to advise the center on their current-technology-systems . the daylong-meeting at harvard looked at case-management and quality-assessment-issues , and concluded with hopes for future-partnerships between the center and lsc . • over and above the activities described above , tig staff made presentations at : o harvard law-school - bellows-sacks legal-clinic o aba national-conference of bar presidents o aba techshow o chinese legal-aid delegation sponsored by the national committee on united states-china relations • lsc convened a june summit in st. louis seeking-feedback about the tig program and on broader technology-issues . invited was a representative-sample of program-grantees and technology-experts . we wanted to learn about the tig program 's effectiveness to date , areas for improvement , and ways we could encourage grantees to improve client-services through emerging-technologies . deliberations ranged widely and many topics were aired . the report , summarizing the discussions of major-issues and how lsc is responding to participants ' recommendations , will issue in 2003 . xiv . legal-work-management and supervision one of best ways to obtain uniformly high-quality-services is to ensure that grantees ' legal-work-management and supervision is rigorous and effective . below , we describe our efforts during on-site-visits and in the competition-process to achieve this goal . we also show how the advocate-component of statewide-websites promotes effective-representation by sharing legal-resources and expertise - generally a function of legal-work-supervisors . legal-work-management reviews in quality visits legal-work-management and supervision-systems are always on the table when lsc staff conduct an on-site-program-quality review . in 2002 , our reviews resulted in lsc recommending-modifications in several-programs ' legal-work-management and supervision-systems . when lsc staff found that one program lacked an effective way to monitor the quality of its advocates ' written legal-work , we gave specific-directions on how the program could establish a system to ensure high quality written legal-work . in another situation , we noted that a program lacked an effective-method to monitor the professional-growth of new and inexperienced-staff . again , we made specific-suggestions on approaches to mentoring these individuals . legal-work-management in the competition-process through the competitive-grants-process , lsc obtains and reviews a substantial-amount of data on an applicant 's plans and systems for legal-work-management and supervision , including : • how cases are assigned and supervised ; • mechanisms to assure that cases and matters are handled in a timely manner ; • mechanisms to assure that clients are kept informed and participate in decisions about their cases ; • mechanisms to assure that case-handlers are aware of and comply with the applicant 's priorities , the lsc act and lsc appropriations acts and regulatory-requirements ; • plans to ensure the availability of specialized expertise and legal-research-materials including-practice-manuals and related materials about substantive poverty-law-issues ; and • timely-information about key judicial , administrative and legislative-developments at state and federal-levels affecting eligible-clients , and appropriate legal-strategies to respond to those developments . legal-work-management through technology the tig program has directed that a portion of the statewide-websites be geared to advocates and their support . the advocate-component of the website allows individual-lawyers easy-access to pro-bono and legal-services-organizations and the support and training needed to represent clients effectively . the advocate-component of the website is organized geographically ( generally by state or city ) , by local-practice-areas and by national-practice areas . each practice-area is defined by a substantive-area of law ( e.g. , family-law , immigration-law , etc. ) . a leading pro-bono or legal-services-organization `` hosts '' each geographic and practice-area . organizations are able to use the site 's extensive-resources to promote and recruit-volunteers ; they also are invited to contribute content to the site . password-protected-practice-areas that are organized by legal topics allow users to share information-online . the advocate's tools include online-libraries of training-materials , model pleadings and links , a current news page , a training and events calendar , postings of new cases for volunteers , and member-driven listservs . both the news and calendar-pages allow all users to submit their own articles and events . administrative tools permit host-organizations to revise content without a webmaster or significant technical-staff . xv . state-planning-body development since its initial-call for state-planning in 1995 , lsc has urged the broadest possible-participation of equal-justice-community stakeholders to create and empower a permanent statewide-body that coordinates civil equal-justice related-efforts , promotes the expansion of civil equal-justice-initiatives , and ensures accountability of all partners to a single , galvanizing-vision . in 2002 , lsc continued to provide technical-assistance and pursue activities to help create or strengthen state-planning-bodies . we also witnessed the fruition of prior-efforts . • the colorado legal-services planning group , in partnership with the leadership of the colorado bar-association and the colorado supreme court , set up a statewide-access to justice commission-a-formal and permanent-planning-entity within the legal-community . • lsc underwrote professional-facilitation of a kick-off retreat for montana 's designated state-planning-body that led to the state 's first access to justice-conference in september . lsc vice-president for programs randi youells was the keynote speaker . • the chief-justice of the supreme court of puerto rico announced the creation of an access to justice commission during lsc 's 2002 state-planning visit . this fall , the commission was formally created and members appointed . the puerto rico bar-association will staff the commission . • in spring 2002 , the state-bar of georgia access to justice committee launched a state-planning-effort to strengthen the delivery of civil legal-services for the poor . strategies for achieving their vision include securing more funding for providers , establishing and maintaining-programs that meet a range of legal-needs , expanding-coordination among stakeholders , and fostering public-support for the concept of equal-access to justice . action groups will report on ways to improve georgia 's civil legal-services-system . • massachusetts completed a comprehensive statewide-client needs assessment , a critical-element in their re-energized-state planning-process . • in arkansas , lsc technical-assistance-funds are allowing the two lsc-programs and the arkansas bar-association to put in place a permanent-access to justice-group . • in alabama and new york , lsc technical-assistance-funds have resulted in configuration-plans drawn by an expanded community of stakeholders deeply engaged in building permanent and effective-state planning-bodies . • in mississippi , our funds supported the hiring of a professional-facilitator . the effective-use of technology to assist clients and improve legal-skills does not just happen , it has to be planned . the tig program specifically addresses the development of state-technology plans by providing , through tig grants , technical-personnel needed to assist programs in using-technology to deliver services to clients as effectively as possible . in general , our grants-support technical-personnel directed to deliver a statewide-technology-plan . specific-grants awarded in 2002 went to north dakota and louisiana for technology-staff dedicated to helping-state-planning bodies prepare statewide-technology-plans . in addition , tig staff assist our grantees ' staff , when asked ; one common-request is to review-resumes of applicants for technology-positions to be sure they have the requisite-credentials . xvi . national collaborations as the linchpin-member of the national civil-justice-community , lsc regularly joins with its national-partners to promote equal-access . during 2002 , we worked with national-colleagues on specific-activities . american bar-association lsc is very concerned about the law-school-debt burden that graduates carry . a recent-study found that the students ' median-law school-debt is more than $ 84,000 - an amount that does not include the additional undergraduate-debt-burden that many students bear . this debt-burden , coupled with the famously low-salaries in the legal-services-community , dramatically reduces the ability of our grantees to attract and retain high quality new lawyers . lsc has joined with the aba commission on loan repayment and forgiveness to study this problem and to recommend solutions . national center on poverty-law lsc has partnered with the national center on poverty-law to provide training to the field on how to use the internet and other tools to facilitate poverty-law-research . in addition , we supported the creation of a 250-page poverty-law manual that introduces advocates to the fundamentals of poverty-law . national legal-aid and defender association lsc 's work with nlada continues on many fronts . collaborative-efforts enriched lsc 's resource library initiative website . together we have advocated on behalf of lsc grantees at other federal-agencies on issues arising out of other federal-grants that the grantees receive . aarp and the management-information exchange the october launch of lri was the result of our cooperative endeavors with a host of national-organizations - nlada , aarp legal-counsel for the elderly , and mie . our productive-relationships with these entities led to additional-opportunities for information-gathering and sharing . for example , as a direct-result of our lri work , we were asked to cosponsor ( with aarp and mie ) the '' innovations in civil legal-services '' workshop at the nlada annual conference , described in detail above in promoting the development of effective legal-services . legal-services-technology funders group lsc works cooperatively with several national-organizations that make technology-grants - the open society institute , the national center for state-courts , and the state-justice institute . our joint-goal is to coordinate funding-efforts to improve the delivery of legal-services through the use of technology . in 2002 , our activities with the national center for state-courts led to the award of a tig grant to our grantee in maryland to implement a project on pro se resources first conceptualized by the national center for state-courts . conclusion the past year saw the creation of many projects , the maturation of several young-initiatives and the opportunity to take existing-efforts to new levels . it has been a very productive twelve months , not without its stresses and disappointments . overall , the programs staff is pleased with the progress we have made and believe that our work has led to significant-improvements in the opportunities for poor-people in our country to access legal-services . we are also convinced that our endeavors have strengthened existing legal-services-delivery systems so that clients now receive legal-assistance more appropriate to their current-needs and future hopes . many years ago , reginald heber smith famously noted that the reason-poverty-organizations have not `` more completely answered the demand of the poor for legal-assistance is that they are grossly under financed . '' that is as true-today as it was in 1919 . nonetheless , we believe that our technical-assistance-funds , tig awards , lri resources , our partnerships with national-organizations and the many other methods by which lsc extends the resources allocated by congress to our grantees has ameliorated somewhat the woefully underfunded-situation of legal-services-programs .
