coup reshapes legal-aid-programs : one directors ' path is smooth while another 's is rough by gina keating daily journal staff writer los angeles - a government-sponsored-coup last year made bruce iwasaki and neal dudovitz the kings of los angeles county's federally funded legal-aid-community . the two men emerged atop a changed-landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public-dollars doled out by an unsympathetic gop-controlled congress . that era was capped in 1998 , when the legal-services corp. forced 275 legal-aid-providers nationwide to combine into 179 . to comply with the orders from their main-funding-source , a new species of poverty-lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free-phone lines , self-help-kiosks and internet access to legal-advice . while some organizations made the dramatic-change-look effortless , for others , it did not come easy . and few programs provide more dramatic-illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal-services than los angeles county 's two largest providers of federally funded services - legal-aid foundation of los angeles and pacoima-based neighborhood legal-services of los angeles county . from his offices in koreatown , iwasaki , a soft-spoken former o'melveny & myers attorney , quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller legal-aid society of long beach and his program , the legal-aid foundation of los angeles . the merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal-order . today , the programs operate seamlessly , offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual-phone-advisers , expanded-hours for domestic-violence-clinics , and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program . the organization is los angeles ' largest government-funded-group , with a budget of $ 11 million leveraged into $ 40 million in legal-services to the poor . iwasaki 's careful-respect for the long beach program and its lawyers earned him the political-capital he needed to complete his takeover in a matter of weeks . `` the long beach program had strong support in the community so in a situation like that , one has to recognize that it 's not like a takeover where i have all the answers and i know best , '' iwasaki said . `` the people in the community who are working there have the contacts and the knowledge that will allow service to continue . '' things have gone less smoothly across town . there , dudovitz , a longtime-poverty-lawyer and executive director of the san fernando valley 's 36-year-old legal-aid-program , continues to struggle with his hostile-takeover of the neighboring san gabriel-pomona-valleys service-area one year after it was accomplished . on the bright-side , dudovitz has extended his respected-program to clients in the san gabriel-pomona valley , and he now operates on a much larger budget , $ 6.5 million last year . however , his clash with the old san gabriel program resulted in litigation , bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor-people . `` it was a difficult-situation that was probably mishandled by everyone , '' a longtime-observer of the public-interest-community said of the san fernando valley-san gabriel-pomona valley merger . `` there are very few people who come out as the heroes . personalities got involved when they should n't have . things were said that caused bad-feelings and could n't be unsaid . '' iwasaki 's merger with the smaller , 48-year-old long beach program was friendly and fast , and no one - not even long beach board members - lost a job . when it was over , iwasaki had $ 1 million more in federal-dollars and two new offices . long beach clients regained-services they had lost years ago when federal-budget-cuts and dwindling-grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer-law-programs . iwasaki said , `` [ i judged the transition ] better than i could have hoped for . '' former long beach executive director toby rothschild , now a policy-wonk in iwasaki 's outfit , agreed . `` to some extent , i did look at it and say , 'we are the littlest kid on the block , and we do n't want to get beat up so we need a bigger protector , ' '' rothschild said . `` once we got past that , it became a real positive for the long beach program and long beach clients . '' but to the san gabriel-pomona valley legal-aid-program , the positives of merging with dudovitz 's program , san fernando valley neighborhood legal-services , were never obvious . a meeting in late 1999 between dudovitz and the san gabriel-pomona valley program 's board showed how little the two programs had in common and how difficult bridging the gap between their ideologies would be , dudovitz recalled . although no merger-plans were discussed , board members at the smaller program knew of dudovitz 's preference for impact-litigation over direct-services . `` we had a discussion about what our separate-views were , '' dudovitz said . `` the message we got was that they wanted their program to stay as it was . '' lauralea-saddick , former-executive-director of the san gabriel-pomona valley program , said her board simply did not share dudovitz 's desire to spend money influencing social-policy and participating in high-profile-litigation over poverty-related issues . `` our board 's philosophy was that the money given by the federal government was to help people with basic everyday-needs , '' saddick said . `` it might take a little-bit of humility to take those kinds of cases . impact-work is very important ... but what was the good of getting the law changed if no one is there to help the individual ? '' before the san gabriel program was subsumed by dudovitz 's group , it offered to merge with the legal-aid society of orange county . the boards of both organizations eschewed impact-litigation in favor of the 1960s model of providing direct-client-services . supported by resolutions from the pasadena , san gabriel , eastern and foothill-bar-associations , the two programs drew up plans to merge and submitted them to the legal-services corp. dudovitz won iwasaki 's backing to oppose the deal , and legal-services corp. , the national-funding-source , overruled the proposed san gabriel-pomona valley/orange county merger . on jan. 27 , 2001 , the federal-agency awarded the san gabriel-pomona valley service-area to dudovitz under the umbrella of an expanded san fernando program , citing the location of both programs in los angeles , which would allow `` better coordinated and more effective-advocacy on county-government-policies . '' the san gabriel-pomona valley program sued legal-services corp. to stop the takeover , claiming the federal-program based the decision on favoritism for the politically active-dudovitz and the politically powerful-iwasaki . though the federal-suit accomplished little , it effectively suspended the end of the old program and the start of the new one for nearly a year . hundreds of case-files , as well as two offices in pasadena and pomona , remained under the old program 's control until the litigation ended in august 2001 . `` we were n't being uncooperative in the matter , they were not reasoning [ the transition ] out like lawyers , '' former san gabriel-pomona valley board-president jerome applebaum said . during this period , dudovitz did what he could to claim his new territory - a huge-area bounded by the ventura , kern , san bernardino and riverside county-lines and state route 60 . he renamed his program neighborhood legal-services of los angeles county . he set up a temporary-office in el monte , advertised his toll-free-phone-line through the radio , local elected-officials and the courts . he sent-paralegals and staff-attorneys to conduct several daylong educational-clinics at local-churches , schools and communitybased-organizations . and he accepted city officials' invitations to analyze and comment on a low-income-housing ordinance in pasadena along with other housing-advocates . neighborhood legal-services participated in several-cooperative efforts with homeless-advocacy and health-care-agencies in his new territory . dudovitz said that he is halfway to his goal of reorganizing his new territory . still untaken are several-steps that required-goodwill from local-bar-associations and others who had opposed the combination . `` [ i am ] not a fan of neal 's , '' admitted john peck , a former-board member of the san gabriel-pomona valley program and a pasadena bar-association board member . peck says bad-feelings still linger among allies of the old program who feel left out . `` they really screwed us . we had a good-program , '' peck said . an observer familiar with the reconfiguration-debate who requested-anonymity wondered why dudovitz had not spent more time mending-fences . `` he ought to be bending over backwards for reconciliation , but if you want to do impact-work and people in the san gabriel valley want direct-services , you have to accommodate that or change your approach , '' the observer said . `` neal would never consider doing that . '' more than a year after he officially incorporated the san gabriel-pomona valley , dudovitz had not placed a local-resident on the board of neighborhood legal-services or made the rounds of the private legal-community to recruit the volunteer-lawyers . `` our emphasis has been on having our potential-clients know about us and deliver services to them , '' dudovitz said . `` we have done that spectacularly . '' he did not hire any of the old program 's nine lawyers and has yet to permanently place any of his 18 new hires in the san gabriel-pomona valley . the lack of a legal-aid-presence in pomona prompted the bar-association and court-officials to start their own once-monthly family-law clinic . after learning of the effort , dudovitz sent-personnel to staff the clinic for three hours per week and is helping to write a grant-application to fund a self-help-kiosk for pomona patterned on the center he pioneered in van nuys . the help , although late , has earned dudovitz some appreciation . `` there has been a transition and [ the clinic ] has helped to fill some void , '' said deni butler , administrator for the eastern district superior court . `` but we are working together quite nicely contrary to what the other side-issue is . '' scott wheeler , president of the eastern bar-association of los angeles and an ally of the old program , said he mobilized his 200 members to staff the clinic after watching the ranks of unserved poor grow over the past year . `` we felt we needed to take care of something that had disappeared . we established the program because we were concerned about the changeover , '' wheeler said . while acknowledging that building the new program from the ground up has been slow going , dudovitz expects to serve up to 30 percent more clients in the san gabriel-pomona valley than his predecessors . of the 700,000 to 1 million people who are eligible for legal-aid-services in his combined area , dudovitz estimated that he will serve more than 30,000 annually . during his first year in the new territory , he served 25,000 in the program - a 20-percent-increase over his caseload for san fernando alone , dudovitz said . `` the reality is we have to make the transition-step by step , '' dudovitz said . `` we need to establish some infrastructure before we go out . one of the worse things that you can do is promise services that we ca n't deliver . '' during his 29-year tenure as a public-interest-lawyer , dudovitz has proved that he can deliver on some of the legal-services corp. 's key-objectives . by 2000 , he had diversified funding-sources for his then- $ 5.2 million budget so that just 32 percent came from federal-programs . he got the rest from private-funds and state and local-government contracts and grants . he hoped to do the same thing for the san gabriel-pomona valley program , whose $ 1.8 million budget was derived almost entirely of legal-services corp. grants . he had learned the importance of reputation to private sector fund-raising after the federal emergency management agency cited his program before congress for excellence in cases stemming from the 1994 northridge-earthquake . `` after that , we were able to raise funds , '' he said . `` people generally want to give to programs that do quality-work because they get results . we are creative and effective-advocates . '' competitive-bidding also became easier with a reputation to back up his grant-proposals , and dudovitz soon was raising enough to develop slick promotional-materials and to share funds with other public-interest-programs to cement collaborative-efforts on health care , policy-advocacy , homelessness , domestic-violence-assistance , self-help and technology-development . he developed a reputation as an innovator with a multimillion-dollar-grant from the california endowment to fund a countywide health advocacy program called health consumer center of los angeles . the 3-year-old program connected 10,000 poor-people with health care and earned dudovitz entrée to legislative-committees and elected-officials grappling with how to provide medical-services for the poor . long before legal-services corp. advised legal-aid-programs to recruit more privatesector-attorneys , dudovitz in 1992 established domestic-violence-clinics in four san fernando valley courthouses in a partnership with the local-bar-association . he tapped that relationship again in 1999 to create two self-help legal-access-centers -one at the van nuys courthouse and the other at james monroe high school in north hills - where legal magnet-students assist pro per defendants . `` one of the things that is clear is that we could throw 50 or 60 lawyers out there , and we could never approach the need in regards to providing-one-on-one-service , '' dudovitz said . `` but we can be effective if [ we are ] thoughtful about how we employ staff and the balance of the service we provide . '' dudovitz acknowledged that the acrimonious-transition may not have been ideal for clients but said the range of services now available to them will more than compensate for any lapse of services . although he lauds his counterpart , iwasaki , and the long beach community for their ideal-marriage , dudovitz had no regrets about his own stormy-rise to power . `` they were one of probably a handful of places in the country where that happened , '' he said . `` we have an opportunity to grow a program based on 30 years of experience - we are n't stuck with the old way . that 's an opportunity that very few people have had .
