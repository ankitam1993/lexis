office of the general counsel b-271810.2 may 7 , 1996 the honorable larry pressler chairman the honorable ernest f. hollings ranking minority member committee on commerce , science , and transportation united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : light-truck average-fuel-economy standard , model-year 1998 pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the national highway-traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) , department of transportation , entitled `` light-truck average-fuel-economy standard , model-year 1998 '' ( rin 2127-af16 ) . we received the rule on april 22 , 1996 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on april 3 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 14680 . section 32902 ( a ) of title 49 , united states code , requires the secretary of transportation to prescribe by regulation , at least 18 months in advance of each model-year , average-fuel-economy standards ( known as `` corporate average-fuel-economy '' or `` cafe '' standards ) for non-passenger-automobiles manufactured in that model-year . under subsections 32902 ( a ) and ( f ) , the standard is to be the maximum feasible average-fuel-economy level that the secretary decides manufacturers can achieve in that model-year taking into consideration technological-feasibility , economic-practicability , the effect of other government gao/ogc-96-11 motor-vehicle standards on fuel-economy , and the need of the united states to 1 conserve energy . the light-truck cafe standard for model-year 1997 was established at 20.7 miles per gallon ( mpg ) . during the development of the cafe standard for model-year 1998 , the department of transportation and related agencies appropriations-act , 1996 , pub . l. no . 104-50 ( nov. 15 , 1995 ) , 109 stat . 436 , was enacted . section 330 of the appropriations-act , 109 stat . 457 , provides : '' none of the funds in this act shall be available to prepare , propose , or promulgate any regulations pursuant to title v of the motor-vehicle information and cost-savings act ( 49 u.s.c . 32901 , et seq . ) prescribing corporate average-fuel-economy standards for automobiles , as defined in such title , in any model-year that differs from standards promulgated for such automobiles prior to the enactment of this section . '' nhtsa interprets section 330 of the appropriations-act as requiring it to prescribe the same light-truck cafe standard for model-year 1998 that applies to model-year 1997 . accordingly , the rule continues the 20.7 mpg-standard for 1998 . enclosed is our assessment of nhtsa 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . as discussed in the enclosure , nhtsa did not follow many of the steps that ordinarily would apply to the rule , based in part on its interpretation that section 330 of the appropriations-act required it to fix the 1998 standard at 20.7 mpg and thereby deprived the agency of any discretion over the standard . nhtsa 's interpretation of section 330 , while not necessarily the only plausible-approach , is supported by the language and legislative-history of this provision . nevertheless , we do not view section 330 as exempting the rulemaking from the requirements referred to in 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) , particularly the analysis called for by 49 u.s.c . § 32902 . if you have any questions about this report , please contact henry r. wray , senior-associate general counsel , at ( 202 ) 512-8581 . the official responsible for gao's 1authority to prescribe fuel-economy-standards under section 32902 has been delegated by the secretary to the administrator of nhtsa . page 2 gao/ogc-96-11 evaluation-work relating to the department of transportation is john h. anderson , director of transportation and telecommunications issues . mr. anderson can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-2834 . sincerely yours , robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : ms. nancy e. mcfadden general counsel department of transportation page 3 gao/ogc-96-11 enclosure analysis of national highway-traffic safety administration 1998 light-truck cafe standard rule under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis on january 3 , 1996 , nhtsa published a notice of proposed-rulemaking which proposed a 1998 standard of 20.7 mpg . see 61 fed . reg . 145 . the supplementary-information accompanying the proposed-rule contains a discussion and assessment of the economic-impacts of the proposed standard , including its potential-costs , benefits , and alternatives . in addition , nhtsa prepared a preliminary regulatory-evaluation of the proposed standard , which was included in the docket for the rulemaking and contained more detailed analyses of these and other affects of the proposed standard . the agency did not prepare a final regulatory-impact-analysis in connection with the final-rule `` because of the restrictions imposed by section 330 of the fy 1996 dot appropriations-act . '' 61 fed . reg . at 14682 . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 section 603 : initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis the supplementary-information accompanying the proposed-rulemaking includes a certification , pursuant to section 605 ( b ) of title 5 , that the proposal would not have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities , thereby exempting the proposed-rule from the requirement for an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis . the certification was accompanied by a statement that few , if any , light-truck manufacturers subject to the proposed-rule would be classified as small businesses . see 61 fed . reg . at 155 . section 605 ( b ) states that the certification and statement shall be provided to the chief-counsel for advocacy of the small business-administration ( sba ) . according to department of transportation officials , the certification and statement were not separately provided to the sba chief-counsel for advocacy . they stated that , in accordance with the department 's practice , publication of section 605 ( b ) certifications in the federal register is treated as providing-notice to sba . an sba official confirmed that some agencies follow this practice , and that sba has not objected to it . the official indicated , however , that sba 's policy may change since future-certifications will need to be justified more specifically and will be subject to judicial-review . page 1 gao/ogc-96-11 section 604 : final regulatory-flexibility-analysis nhtsa did not conduct a final regulatory-flexibility-analysis under section 604 , nor did it make a section 605 ( b ) certification , in connection with the final-rule . the agency viewed such an analysis as `` unnecessary '' in light of its lack of discretion with respect to the rule , but stated that past-evaluations indicated few if any small businesses would be affected . see 61 fed . reg . at 14682 . section 605 : avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis as noted above , nhtsa invoked the exemption from the initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis requirement with respect to the proposed-rule . section 607 : preparation of analysis as noted above , nhtsa did not prepare an initial or final regulatory-flexibility-analysis . section 609 : participation by small-entities the requirements of section 609 are inapplicable to this rule since nhtsa did not determine that it would have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 since the standard appears to constitute a federal-mandate resulting in aggregate annual private-sector-expenditures of $ 100 million or more , it would be subject to the requirements of section 202 of the act ( statements to accompany significant regulatory-actions ) . neither the proposed nor the final-rulemaking expressly refers to the unfunded-mandates reform act or includes the statements required by section 202 . the supplementary-information accompanying the proposed-rule does include some of the information covered by section 202 . the rule also appears subject to section 205 of the act , relating to consideration of regulatory-alternatives . while nhtsa did not explicitly address section 205 , it complied in substance with the requirements of this section . potential-alternatives were considered and discussed at the proposed-rulemaking stage , and the final-rulemaking describes nhtsa 's determination that there was no alternative to the standard adopted . the requirements of section 203 ( small government-agency plan ) and section 204 ( state , local , and tribal-government input ) appear to be inapplicable to the rule . page 2 gao/ogc-96-11 ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule was promulgated through the general-notice of proposed-rulemaking procedures of the act , 5 u.s.c . § 553 . nhtsa afforded interested-persons the opportunity to comment on the proposed-rule . the final-rulemaking , however , does not address-comments . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule does not refer to information-collection-requirements subject to the act , and , according to nhtsa , the rule imposes no such requirements . national environmental policy act , 42 u.s.c . §§ 4321 et seq . nhtsa did not conduct an evaluation of the impacts of the rule under the national environmental policy act . the supplementary-information accompanying the final-rule-states in this regard : '' there is no requirement for such an evaluation where congress has eliminated the agency 's discretion by precluding any action other than the one announced in this notice . '' 61 fed . reg . at 14682 . statutory-authorization for the rule the supplementary-information accompanying the final-rule discusses at length its legal-basis . section 32902 ( a ) of title 49 , united states code , requires that light-truck cafe standards be prescribed for each model-year in accordance with the `` maximum feasible '' criteria specified in that subsection and subsection 32902 ( f ) . however , section 330 of the appropriations-act effectively prohibited issuance of any cafe standard `` that differs from standards promulgated . . . prior to the enactment of this section . '' according to nhtsa 's legal-analysis detailed in the supplementary-information , section 330 of the appropriations-act precluded the agency from prescribing any cafe standard different from the most recent-standards prescribed at the time of its enactment -- those applicable to model-year 1997 . thus , according to nhtsa , section 330 deprived the agency of the discretion it otherwise would have under section 32902 to determine the applicable-standard under the criteria set forth therein . nhtsa concluded that while section 330 superseded the section 32902 criteria , it did not supersede the section 32902 mandate that there be cafe standards for model-year 1998 . nhtsa noted that the only other possible-interpretation of section 330 was to treat the phrase `` standards promulgated . . . prior to the enactment of this section '' as page 3 gao/ogc-96-11 encompassing any standard prescribed for any prior-model-year . in addition to the 20.7 mpg-standard , nine other light-truck-standards -- ranging from 17.5 to 21.0 mpg -- were promulgated for prior model years.1 however , nhtsa rejected this interpretation on the basis that it could also conflict with the `` maximum feasible '' criteria under 49 u.s.c . § 32902 , and that it would be illogical to assume that congress intended to arbitrarily limit the 1998 standard to one of these prior-year-levels even if some other level was determined to be the `` maximum feasible '' for model-year 1998 . accordingly , nhtsa concluded that the only legally-permissible alternative was to establish the model-year 1998 standard at 20.7 mpg . as a result , the agency did not complete its analysis to determine what the `` maximum feasible '' level actually would be for model-year 1998 under the 49 u.s.c . § 32902 criteria . nhtsa 's legal-interpretation is supported by the language and legislative-history of section 330 . as the analysis points out , the house appropriations committee report and a floor-statement by the principal-sponsor of section 330 -- representative delay -- describe section 330 as permitting nhtsa to establish a 1998 standard '' identical to '' the model-year 1997 standard . the conference-report describes section 330 as prohibiting the use of funds for '' regulations that prescribe changes in '' the cafe standards . on the other hand , we question whether nhtsa was compelled by section 330 to forego completion of the analysis otherwise mandated by 49 u.s.c . § 32902 to determine the `` maximum feasible '' level for model-year 1998 . the legislative-history of section 330 , taken as a whole , suggests that the fundamental-purpose of this provision was to prevent an anticipated-increase in the cafe standards . representative delay observed in his floor-statement that nhtsa was engaged in a rulemaking `` which could result in a sharp-increase in the standards for light-trucks and vans '' and that `` this action would be devastating to the nation 's economy . '' 141 cong . rec . h7605 ( daily ed. , july 25 , 1995 ) . he also stated that section 330 '' imposes a 1-year freeze on the ability of nhtsa to increase the cafe standards '' and that `` it was my intent that nhtsa would withhold any further action directed toward increasing cafe standards . . .. '' id . in this context , the references in the history to requiring an identical-standard or precluding any changes for 1998 may have been based on the assumption that the outcome of any change would be an increase in the standard . completing the analysis under 49 u.s.c . § 32902 would have provided nhtsa more information on which to assess the relationship between that section and section 1these-standards are listed in a table included in the final-rule . the 21-mpg-standard was initially prescribed for model-year 1985 , but was amended to 19.5 mpg before the start of that model-year page 4 gao/ogc-96-11 330 . for example , if the analysis indicated that the `` maximum feasible '' level for 1998 was at or closer to one of the lower prior-year-standards than it was to the 1997 standard , prescribing that lower standard would not necessarily be impermissible . such an action would give greater effect to 49 u.s.c . § 32902 than using the 20.7 mpg-standard and would satisfy the plain-terms of section 330 . nor is it clear that such action would conflict with the purpose underlying-section 330 . the history does not explicitly address the possibility that the 20.7 mpg-standard might exceed the `` maximum feasible '' level for 1998 indicated under 49 u.s.c . § 32902 . executive-order no . 12866 based on its economic-impact , the rule was determined to be a '' significant regulatory-action '' within the meaning of executive-order no . 12866 . consistent with the executive-order , the rule was initiated through an advance-notice of proposed-rulemaking published on april 6 , 1994 . 59 fed . reg . 16324 . as noted previously , the proposed-rulemaking published on january 3 , 1996 , includes a preliminary regulatory-evaluation . the final-rule , however , does not include a final regulatory-impact-analysis . according to nhtsa , the office of information and regulatory affairs reviewed the rule at the proposed and final-stages and suggested no changes . executive-order 12612 the supplementary-information accompanying the proposed-rule states that , based on an analysis of the principles and criteria contained in executive-order no . 12612 , nhtsa determined that the proposed-rule would not have sufficient-federalism-implications to warrant preparation of a federalism-assessment . 61 fed . reg . at 155 . the supplementary-information accompanying the final-rule-states that the final-rule was not analyzed under executive-order no . 12612 because of the nhtsa 's lack of discretion with respect to the rule . it adds that prior light-truck-standards have not been viewed as having federalism-implications warranting-preparation of a federalism-analysis . 61 fed . reg . at 14682 . nhtsa did not identify any other statutes or executive-orders imposing-requirements relevant to the rule . page 5 gao/ogc-96-11
