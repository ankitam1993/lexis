federal-agency asserts claim to buildings sunday , september 22 , 2002 by herb frazier a congressional-agency that funds legal-services for low-income americans is battling charleston lawyers over control of buildings that once housed legal-assistance-programs in charleston , georgetown and conway . at stake is prime real estate in the coastal-cities , including a charleston building in the heart of upscale commercial-development on upper king street . the washington-based legal-services corp. wants the buildings transferred to the s.c. centers for equal-justice , said lsc spokesman eric kleiman . the lsc was once the funding-agency for the neighborhood legal-assistance-program corp. in charleston . in january , the lsc-funding went to the greenville-based equal-justice-centers . in an aug. 21 letter to nlap board-chairman gerald a. kaynard , lsc president john n. erlenborn said : `` if nlap fails to effectuate these transfers by aug. 31 , lsc will take all necessary-steps to protect its interest in these properties . '' kaynard did not return repeated phone-calls from the post and courier . as part of its funding-agreement , the lsc requires property purchased with government-funds be returned to the nonprofit-corporation if a local-agency loses its grant , kleiman said . in august , the 4th circuit-court of appeals upheld that requirement in a lawsuit lsc filed in a property-dispute with a legal-services-program in big stone gap , va. kleiman said , `` we will continue to work with nlap to work out an orderly-transfer of the property . we hope this can be resolved amicably . '' last year , nlap lost its federal-grant with a nationwide consolidation of legal-aid-programs . in january , the federal-agency awarded a $ 4.4 million grant to the centers for equal-justice , which has a charleston area-office and sites in 11 other south carolina cities . with a budget of $ 329 million , lsc provides civil legal-assistance to low-income-people in every county in america , kleiman said . nlap was created in 1968 . a decade later , the agency used a $ 50,000 lsc-grant to buy a building at 438 king st. in charleston and $ 33,000 to buy a building at 201 king st. in georgetown , according to erlenborn 's letter to kaynard . in 1980 , nlap used $ 63,000 in lsc-funds to buy property at 607 main st. in conway , the letter said . on nov. 14 , 2001 , nlap transferred-title of the king street building in charleston to the charleston county-bar-association , according to county-property-records . the local-bar paid $ 5 for the building , which sits between a redeveloped office-building and an antique-shop . the local-bar said it would maintain the building for `` legal-services to indigent-residents of charleston county and coastal south carolina , '' the records said . the king street building appears to be vacant . notices at the entrance direct-visitors to the equal-justice-center on west montague avenue in north charleston . e. douglas pratt-thomas , president of the local-bar , was not available for comment . charleston county has not appraised the king street property because it is tax-exempt . but randall goldman , managing partner of patrick properties , which owns buildings from 440 to 456 king st. , said he estimates 438 king st. would sell for between $ 700,000 and $ 900,000 . `` that building , which was purchased solely with federal legal-aid-dollars , should be used to provide legal-services for poor-people in south carolina , '' kleiman said . lsc wants the title to go to the equal-justice-center in charleston or `` we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in charleston . we are not contemplating taking that money out of south carolina , '' he said . kleiman said if the neighborhood legal-program in charleston `` had honored their obligation , this would not be an issue .
