justice is hard to get when you ca n't afford a lawyer f. dianne taylor commentary f. dianne taylor is executive director of legal-services of eastern missouri . we 're all familiar with the miranda warning , or at least how it sounds in the movies . it includes the statement : `` you have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney-present during any questioning . if you can not afford a lawyer , one will be provided for you at government-expense . '' the miranda warning , though , applies only to criminal-cases . what about the less theatrical , but equally-troubling , civil-problems that can afflict people in any walk of life ? u.s. supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg has estimated that four out of every five low-income-people in america who need legal-representation do n't receive it . that is a sobering observation , to realize that 80 percent of those who need legal-help are denied such guidance and counsel . who are these people ? they may be victims of domestic-abuse . perhaps they are elderly-people who are swindled out of their life savings or beaten by a neighbor or acquaintance . maybe they are homeless-children who ca n't attend school because they aren't officially-residents of a district . they are our neighbors , our friends , our colleagues . facing-eviction or physical-assault or bankruptcy without legal-assistance can be every bit as frightening as standing-trial on a criminal charge . issues in civil-cases include family-matters , housing and employment-cases , consumer-protection , public-benefits and income maintenance . in the year 2000 alone , legal-services of eastern missouri fielded some 30,000 calls for assistance from low-income-people in the 21 counties our not-for-profit-organization represents . by contrast , approximately 6,500 cases were closed by the organization last year . more than 312,000 people in the eastern missouri counties stretching from the iowa border to jefferson county qualify for legal-aid , an increase of more than 10 percent from 1990 . with the increase in unemployment and the gradual-decline of the nation 's economy , still more are likely to be unable to afford the legal-help they need . legal-services of eastern missouri does receive the valuable volunteer-assistance of more than 1,500 attorneys . it employs a full- time-staff of about 75 lawyers , paralegals , intake specialists , social-workers and others . and a number of programs now offer legal-assistance for specific-problems : legal-services ' lasting solutions project provides a holistic-approach to the many issues that affect families experiencing domestic-violence . its mc+ project helps people who are enrolled in the medicaid managed care program but have been unable to access the health care to which they are entitled . through the homeless project , volunteer-lawyers visit homeless-shelters and outreach-clinics . the aids project provides legal-assistance for people living with hiv or aids . and the immigration-law project assists people at proceedings on naturalization , temporary protective-status , family-reunification and deportation and exclusion-hearings . as effective as these programs are , much remains to be done . increased financial-assistance from federal , state and local sources could increase the number of legal-professional we could hire . of course , voluntary-support from more members of the legal-community would bring invaluable-expertise and guidance as well . civil-cases may not be fodder for a hot new movie . they are cold , hard-reality , though , and every case closed successfully marks a victory not just for the client but for our entire community . in that way , `` with liberty and justice for all '' can be a way of life as well as a doctrine .
