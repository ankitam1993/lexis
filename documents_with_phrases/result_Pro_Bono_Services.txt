chicago daily law bulletin may 21 , 2002 marketing group to offer 'pro bono ' services kate schott law bulletin staff writer a legal-marketing-group in chicago is asking its members to do what lawyers have been doing for years . the chicago chapter of the legal marketing association will offer pro-bono-services to legal-aid-organizations in the city . members of the lma will help the groups develop long-term-business plans and marketing-strategies . while gaining-access to justice is their first priority , most legal-aid-organizations put marketing and development on the back burner . they often survive on a bare-bones-budget , a staff of volunteers and generous-donations - all for the sake of helping disadvantaged and low-income-people obtain legal-services . many legal-aid-organizations have a strong-mission but lack a long-term-plan , said pat stankard , client-services manager at gardner , carton & douglas and former treasurer of the lma . `` these are issues that we wrestle with in practice-groups of law-firms , '' she said . `` what is your plan ? if [ the legal-aid-organizations ] have a direction and a plan and goals , you have something you can work towards . '' but most legal-aid-organizations ca n't afford and do n't have the resources to develop marketing . `` [ the project ] represents an opportunity for marketing-professionals within the law-firms to do some of the same [ pro-bono-work ] we ask our lawyers to do , '' said michael r. ralston , president of the lma and director of marketing for vedder , price . `` it was that recognition that led us to ... undertake this . '' although it 's common for lawyers to offer pro-bono-services to clients in need , stankard said , legal-marketing-professionals historically have n't done so . `` we thought it was a great opportunity for legal-marketers to give something back to the legal-community , '' she said . stankard said the marketing-professionals will offer advice such as developing-marketing-brochures , volunteer-recognition and increased advertising . the chicago bar-foundation , which supports about 40 legal-aid-organizations , will hold a seminar/reception with lma members to discuss the project at 5 p.m. thursday at the law-office of sidley , austin , brown & wood . to start , the foundation hopes to match lma members with at least 10 of its organizations . legal-aid-organizations are in great need of increased awareness , says leslie a. corbett , executive director of coordinated advice and referral-program for legal-services . she said the groups provide little-information to the general-public and the legislature , which need the education the most . `` [ the public and legislature ] do n't see legal-services as a social-service , '' corbett said . `` they see it as a lawyer 's job . '' but the legal-aid-groups do n't know how to spread the word about the positive-benefits of their work . `` bottom line -- we just do n't know how to do that , '' corbett said . `` i think legal-aid-organizations and small-nonprofits don't even think about [ public relations ] and marketing because all of their resources go into the services they provide . '' julia c. langfelder began her job as the development-coordinator for the center for conflict resolution about a year ago . her position is the first in ccr 's history and was developed to expand the group 's reach through special-events , marketing and public relations . `` it 's very new to the organization and it 's interesting coming in from a [ business ] marketing background , '' she said . `` i think in nonprofits in general there 's a lack of [ marketing ] . '' one reason , she said , is a due to a limited-budget . `` it 's very difficult but you get very creative , '' she said . `` you start looking into new ways of [ planning-events ] . '' in her experience , legal-aid-organizations are in need of long-term-plans , guidance and structure , she said . `` marketing is a process and lot of people do n't realize that , '' langfelder said . `` a lot of people have a misconception that this can happen overnight . `` [ the pro-bono project ] is a great-asset for all of us , '' she said . `` this is really going to push us forward .
