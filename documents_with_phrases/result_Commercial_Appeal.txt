the commercial appeal memphis grants help optimize-nonprofits ' ability to aid community programs deborah m clubb saturday , october 26 , 2002 memphis area legal-services and six other nonprofit-groups will share more than $ 124,000 to help them operate , analyze and plan for growth and survival , thanks to a new focus by the community foundation of greater memphis . the seven grants flow from a new nonprofit-capacity-building program at the foundation , part of a trend among philanthropists to give money to help organizations grow stronger , rather than to the program-services they provide . the community foundation program is primarily for well- established nonprofits that may need assistance to take the organization to another level of performance , said foundation executive director gid smith . the mals grant of $ 25,000 annually for three years is called a '' bridge '' grant to help the nonprofit-law-firm survive a short-term challenge . mals earlier this month announced it expects to lose $ 200,000 in 2003 and beyond , largely-due to a drop in the number of poor-people it serves in four counties , according to the latest census . the nonprofit-law-firm has about 40 employees and an annual-budget of $ 3 million . last year it received more than 6,000 applications for help and was able to serve 3,421 . mals has appealed to the legal-community for funds and greater commitment to pro-bono-services - donating their expertise to the needy . the community foundation is awarding $ 25,000 this year but requiring-mals to submit a three-year-fund-raising-plan . in the second and third-year of the grant , cfgm funds will be awarded as a match , with mals raising at least $ 3 for every $ 1 the foundation provides . in effect , the grant-challenges mals to raise at least $ 100,000 a year in 2003 and 2004 . last year , that campaign - primarily among private-attorneys - drew less than $ 40,000 while the nashville legal-aid-fund-raising garnered more than $ 500,000 . harrison d. mciver iii , mals executive director , said the agency was `` very gratified '' by the community foundation 's grant . `` we have been working very hard to call the legal-community 's and the public 's attention to our funding-crisis and its impact on mals's efforts to secure equal-access to justice for our community 's poor and elderly-residents .
