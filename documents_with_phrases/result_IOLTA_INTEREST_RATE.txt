it 's 2002 : do you know your iolta interest rate ? the supreme court has historically provided mandates for the deposit of client-funds into attorney-trust-accounts . before 1980 , federal law prohibited-interest to be generated on checking-accounts maintained by federally insured banks . therefore , client-funds were deposited into interest-free attorney-trust-accounts . the banks received a windfall : shortterm , interest-free `` loans '' for their use . in 1980 , banking-laws changed . for the first time-banks could offer interest on checking-accounts or now accounts . however , attorneys could rarely take advantage of these interest-bearing accounts for their clients . the purpose of depositing-funds into an attorney 's trust-account was either for short-term-deposits with immediate-access to the funds , or for small-amounts whose interest would not exceed the costs-attendant to separate-accounting . therefore , individualized interest-bearing-trust checking-accounts were unwieldy and impractical . clients could rarely , if ever , earn a positive-net-interest . in 1988 , new jersey joined the ranks of those states that adopted the interest on lawyers ' trust-accounts ( iolta ) fund as a method of collecting and using the interest that would be earned on these deposits . rule 1:28a . all 50 states now have similar-iolta-programs . pursuant to our court-rules , participation in the iolta program is mandatory . the type of funds to be deposited is strictly circumscribed , and the use to which that combined-interest can be assigned , carefully delineated . as a result , what might have amounted to a pittance for a client , in conglomerate became a substantial-fund . according to information routinely gathered and analyzed by our iolta fund , in the year 2000 , the average-balance of all iolta attorney-trust-accounts in new jersey alone on any given day , at any given time was $ 1.2 billion . by the end of the third quarter , sept. 30 , 2001 ( the last-date for which this data is available ) , that amount had increased to an average-daily balance of $ 1.5 billion in roughly 120 participating new jersey banks . that is $ 1.5 billion that these banks can use to fund their mortgages , home-equity loans , automobile-loans , and other types of loans for which they receive approximately 7 percent or more on interest they charge . have you checked the interest rate your bank pays on your iolta account ? the rates vary greatly from 0.25 percent to 2.75 percent , depending on the bank you choose . although this rate-variation may seem minimal , if all the banks paid iolta interest at only 0.25 percent , the annual-earnings on $ 1.5 billion would be only $ 3,750,000 . if every iolta account paid 2.75 percent ( a rate that even iolta concedes is wishful-thinking ) , the earnings would be 11 times greater , or $ 41,250,000 . while many banks continued to pay the same rates in 2001 that they paid in 2000 , others reduced the rates they pay . in fact , the average iolta interest rate paid in 2000 by all of the participating-banks was 1.6 percent . unfortunately , the average-interest-rate paid through the third quarter of 2001 dropped to 1.4 percent . a comparison of two of the major participating-banks demonstrates the disparity in their approaches to iolta . one bank dropped its interest rate in november 2001 to 1 percent . the other bank pays the fund-interest based upon tiered-account-levels , more typical of a large commercial-account . as the balance in the account goes up , the interest rate goes up as well , to a high- water-mark of 1.98 percent for accounts with balances of $ 250,000 or more . while a third major-bank advertised its november money market-account-rates to be between 1.73 percent for accounts with $ 5,000 and 2.47 percent for accounts with $ 50,000 or more , that bank pays iolta a flat 1.1 percent . even its advertised-passbook savings-accounts earned 1.49 percent . meanwhile , some of the banks that have reduced interest rates to iolta also charge higher activity-fees to iolta . a few banks-charge fees as high as 23 percent of the gross-interest earned . on average , the iolta fund repays 5 percent of all its earnings to those banks that charge for these accounts . these fees generally include monthly-account-fees and per check and per deposit-charges on each transaction . yet , only half of the iolta participating-banks actually charge the fund these fees . half of the banks-charge no fees-whatsoever , simply-satisfied to have these accounts as a significant growing-source of inexpensive-money to use almost interest-free . in 2000 , iolta collected $ 16.3 million to fund its very narrowly construed-mission . as designated by the supreme court , the fund uses the money to provide legal-aid to the poor , and education and beneficial-services to the public . legal-services of new jersey receives 75 percent of the funds . the new jersey state-bar foundation receives 12.5 percent for educational-lay-programs relating to law and justice , and other public-service-programs such as the high school mock trial competition and numerous publications . the balance of the funds is granted to small-entities that provide legal-services and assistance to the indigent . r.1:28a-4 . for instance , iolta grants money to several court appointed special advocate programs ( casa ) for children in essex , morris-sussex , mercer and atlantic-cape may . the casa program is a volunteer-organization of people who assist and advocate for the rights of individual-children in foster-care . iolta grants go to the covenant house youth advocacy program , the advocate of legal-rights of homeless-youths who , having reached the age of 18 , are no longer eligible to be in foster-care . in 2002 , $ 2.1 million in iolta grants will support these and numerous other crucial-programs that offer priceless-services to the poor . the $ 16.3 million raised for iolta is not enough . legal-services which provides civil legal-services to the poor , the disabled , and the most vulnerable-citizens of the state , can only represent , at best , 25 percent of the people who are in need of assistance and who meet the requirements for representation . in a `` legal-triage , '' they must select those most in immediate need . the rest of their applicants must wait , or give up . even the amount of the fund is not guaranteed . in the pending difficult economic-times , when the rush to refinance has passed , will these accounts maintain their $ 1.5 billion average-daily balance ? if interest rates continue to decline , or the daily balances-decrease , the iolta fund will be curtailed . with less funding for legal-services , what will happen to those so much in need ? what will happen to the pro-bono requirements already imposed upon attorneys in new jersey ? what can we , as members of the bar who control these accounts , do to protect the iolta fund ? the easy-answer is : `` ask . '' ask your bank what interest rate it pays to iolta . ask your bank what fees it charges to iolta . comparison-shop . understand the spread between what your bank pays the iolta fund and what it charges your clients . yet , we only can control our own accounts . better yet , we call upon the new jersey state-bar-association , and each county-bar-association , to lend a voice to iolta . the bar-associations could consult with the iolta directors , and then contact-banks to determine which ones are providing the best returns with the lowest costs to iolta . the promise of more business , or the loss thereof , would have far more impact coming from an association than any single-law-firm . attorneys hold the purse-strings . why not turn them into reins ? we can , with little-effort , steer our attorney-trust-accounts to those banks that are willing to pay just a little more for the privilege of receiving our trust-deposits .
