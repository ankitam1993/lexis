chicago daily law bulletin donald hilliker steps to the fore at legal-aid-organization julia brunts september 5 , 2002 donald b. hilliker has his work cut out for him -- as much as $ 1 million worth . hilliker , a long-time-member of the board for the legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago , has taken over as president of the organization . hilliker 's term is one year , and it happens to be the year in which the foundation anticipates large reductions in funding from several of its money-sources . sheldon roodman , laf executive director since 1976 , said the foundation has an annual-budget of about $ 12 million . of that , about $ 6.4 million has in the past come from the legal-services corp. , the entity that disburses federal-money for legal-aid . in the wake of the 2000 census , which showed 35,000 fewer poor-people in the state , as well as a change in the distribution formula , laf expects to get $ 350,000 less from lsc starting next january , roodman said . in addition , he said several-foundations that give money to the laf have seen their endowments shrink with the declining-stock market , and the money available from the interest on lawyers-trust-accounts program also has dwindled as interest rates have approached zero . at the same time , requests for services from the foundation , which has the mission of providing free legal-aid to poor-people in order to make `` equal-access to justice '' a reality , have increased as the economy has softened . `` we 're caught in a vise here with more demand and less resources , '' he said . `` there is a real-challenge for our board of directors to help us raise additional-funds to help offset these losses and to help prevent reductions in staff and services to our clients . '' he said hilliker will be a good-person to lead the organization through such an effort . an laf board member since the mid-'80s , hilliker has been involved with legal-aid in some way for his entire-career . hilliker earned his law-degree from northwestern university school of law and was admitted to practice in 1969 . his first job was in legal-services as a reginald heber smith fellow . hilliker is now a complex-litigation-partner in mcdermott , will & emery and chairman of the firm 's pro-bono committee . he said he 's never lost-interest in having lawyers do what they can to help those in need . `` the central-issue is that we are a society of laws , and for that to truly work , there must be equal-access to the justice-system for everyone , whether they have the ability to pay or not , '' he said . roodman said hilliker is in an excellent-position to help the foundation attract more private-donors and recruit-lawyers in private-practice to volunteer their services . `` i think mr. hilliker brings extraordinary-leadership to the organization , '' he said . `` because of his many years of service on our board , he knows its strengths and the importance of its work . he will be good at getting the whole-board to take a more active-role in fund-raising .
