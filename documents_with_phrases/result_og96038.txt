( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the department of health and human-services , food and drug administration entitled `` regulations restricting the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless-tobacco to protect children and adolescents '' ( rin : 0910-aa48 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis an analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule was conducted by the food and drug administration ( fda ) and published in the notice of proposed-rulemaking on august 11 , 1995 , and is contained in the preamble to the final-rule . the analysis in the final-rule has been revised based on comments the fda received and now also considers the costs and benefits associated with a rule issued by the substance-abuse and mental-health-services administration ( samhsa ) on january 19 , 1996 , governing a program of state-operated enforcement-activities to restrict the sale or distribution of tobacco-products to individuals under the age of 18 . fda considers the two rules complementary and can not separately quantify the benefits of the two programs and since both rules work collectively to reduce youth-access to tobacco-products , the costs attributable to the samhsa program are included in the analysis . the analysis based its benefits on achieving the `` healthy-people 2000 , '' a department program , goal of reducing underage-tobacco-use by one-half in order to prevent over 60,000 early-deaths . the analysis places a monetary-value of these health-benefits ( at a 3 percent-discount-rate ) at an estimated $ 28 to $ 43 billion per year , including $ 2.6 billion in medical-cost-savings , $ 900 million in productivity-gains from reduced morbidity and $ 24.6 to $ 39.7 billion per year in willingness-to-pay-values for averting premature-fatalities . the analysis states that if the 50-percent-reduction in underage-tobacco-use is not reached and only 5 percent of the 1 million adolescents who become new smokers are deterred , the annual-benefits would be $ 2.8 to $ 4.3 billion per year . fda estimates the overall-compliance-costs of the rule to be from $ 174 million to $ 187 million in one-time-costs and $ 149 million to $ 185 million in annual-operating-costs . these costs will be borne by manufacturers ( $ 78 to $ 91 million in one-time-costs and $ 2 million in annual-costs ) , retail-establishments ( $ 96 million in one-time-costs and $ 78 million in annual-costs ) , fda ( $ 3 to $ 5 million in enforcement-costs per year ) and state-governments ( $ 25 to $ 50 million per year in administering various samhsa enforcement programs ) . gao/ogc-96-38 fda recognizes that it could not quantify every regulatory-cost because of significant distributional and transitional-effects of the rule . for example , lost-sales experienced by suppliers of advertising were considered distributional-impacts because the dollars not spent on advertising are not lost to the economy but will be spent on other goods and services . also , if state and federal excise-taxes remain at the current levels , tax-revenues will decrease over time because of decreased sales . in conclusion , the analysis finds that while compliance with the rule will bring significant-health-benefits to the population and also exact long-term revenue-losses on the tobacco-industry and short-term-costs on various affiliated-industry-sectors , the benefits of the rule will greatly exceed the compliance-costs on the united states economy . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 the fda has concluded that the rule will have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities and an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis and final regulatory-flexibility-analysis have been prepared and included in the notice of proposed-rulemaking and the final-rule-notice , respectively , as required by sections 603 and 604 . the analyses comply with the informational-requirements of the sections including the classes of small-entities-subject to the rule and alternatives considered to reduce the burden on the small-entities . the final-analysis discusses the fda 's decision not to exempt small-entities from the rule because an exemption for small retailers would shift underage-sales to those locations , lessening or eliminating the effectiveness and benefits of the access-restrictions . however , a total-ban on vending-machines and direct-mail order sales have been deleted from the final-rule because of their impact on small-entities . the analyses use both quantifiable and general-descriptions of the effects of the rule on small-entities as required by section 607 and numerous small-entities participated in the rulemaking as required by section 609 by submitting-comments on the proposed regulation following the inclusion in the notice of proposed-rulemaking of the initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis which discussed the economic-impact on small-entities . page 2 gao/ogc-96-38 ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 based on the cost-benefit-analysis performed by fda , the rule will impose an unfunded-mandate on the private sector of over $ 100 million annually and therefore the rule is subject to the requirements of the act . as required by section 205 , fda considered regulatory-alternatives to the requirements of the rule but determined that the provisions of the final-rule constituted the most cost-effective and least burdensome-alternative that would meet the objective of the rule . the fda rejected the regulatory-alternative of a total-ban on all tobacco-advertising . also , a more prescriptive-requirement for manufacturers to monitor the sales and distribution of retail-establishments was not imposed because it would have imposed an additional-cost of $ 85 million per year . finally , a requirement to include package-inserts containing educational-information in cigarette and smokeless-tobacco was not chosen because the fda was not certain the benefits would justify the compliance-costs . section 204 requires that state , local and tribal-governments have an opportunity for input and numerous-comments were received from state and local governments , health-departments , substance-abuse programs and law-enforcement-agencies . these comments were reviewed and considered as discussed in the preamble to the final-rule . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the fda promulgated the rule under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 and its own agency-regulation regarding the promulgation of regulations found at section 10.40 of title 21 of the code of federal-regulations . on august 11 , 1995 , the proposed-rule was published in the federal register ( 60 fed . reg . 41314 ) and in the same issue , a document entitled `` analysis regarding the food and drug administration 's jurisdiction over nicotine-containing-cigarettes and smokeless-tobacco-products '' was published and comments were requested . 60 fed . reg . 41453 . the comment-period , following an extension , remained open for 144 days . in the months that followed the publication of the proposed-rule and during the comment-period , the fda made available to the public over 200,000 pages of documents which were cited by the agency or considered in the promulgation of the rule . page 3 gao/ogc-96-38 the fda received over 700,000 comments in response to the proposed-rule . while the fda reports many of the comments were form-letters , there were over 95,000 distinct or unique-comments filed with the fda . the preamble to the final-rule discusses many of the comments received and the action taken by the agency in response or why the comments did not change the agency 's position . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the proposed-rule contained-information-collections which would have required the manufacturers and retailers of cigarettes and smokeless-tobacco to use established-names for cigarettes and smokeless-tobacco-products , establish and maintain educational-programs , observe certain-formats and content-requirements for labeling and advertising and the submission of labels , labeling and advertising to the fda . the fda solicited-comments on the above information-collections including among other information , the necessity of the collection , the accuracy of the estimated-burden and ways to enhance the information-collection . following the receipt and evaluation of the comments , the fda has revised certain-burden-estimates and has deleted the requirement for the submission of labeling to the fda and the establishment of educational-programs . the information-collections in the proposed-rule were approved by the office of management and budget under omb no . 0910-0312 . because of the above noted-changes to the collections , fda has resubmitted the matter to omb for review and approval and prior to the effective-date of the rule , fda will publish a notice in the federal register of omb 's action on the provisions . statutory-authorization for the rule the fda has cited sections 502 , 510 , 518 , 519 , 520,701 , 704 and 903 of the federal food , drug and cosmetic act ( 21 u.s.c . §§ 352 , 360 , 360h , 360i , 360j , 371 , 374 and 393 ) as authority for the rule and in particular , the device-provisions of the act , including the restricted-device-authority in section 520 ( e ) of the act . 21 u.s.c . § 360j ( e ) . executive-order no . 12866 the rule was determined to be a `` significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order no . 12866 requiring-review by the office of management and budget , office of information and regulatory affairs ( oira ) . oira approved the final-rule on august 22 , 1996 , as complying with the requirements of the order based on the information supplied by fda , including a planned regulatory-action-document page 4 gao/ogc-96-38 describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary-impact of the rule . executive-order no . 12606 ( family ) fda considered whether the rule would have a significant impact on family-formation , maintenance and general-well-being as required by the order and found that the rule would not have a negative impact in these areas . in the preamble to the proposed-rule , it was noted that the rule would help the significant-majority of families that seek to discourage their children from using-cigarettes and smokeless-tobacco . 60 fed . reg . 41356 . fda responds in the preamble to the final-rule to several-comments it received and maintains its conclusion that the rule does not have a negative impact . executive-order no . 12612 ( federalism ) the rule was reviewed by the fda under the order which requires federal-agencies to examine regulatory-actions to determine if they have a significant impact on the states , on the relationship between the states and the federal government , and on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various-levels of government . in the preamble to the final-rule , the fda addresses the various-issues raised by commenters in this area , including the preemption of state and local-laws which are different from or in addition to the requirements under the final-rule ; whether there is an infringement on the states ' right to regulate tobacco and businesses within the state and protect the health of its citizens ; the allocation of a state 's resources and the rule 's possible impact on the states ' economies . the fda concludes that the preemptive-effects of the final-rule are consistent with the order . executive-order no . 12630 ( property rights ) the fda reviewed the rule under the order and concluded that the affect of the final-rule would not constitute a `` taking '' of private property . the preamble to the final-rule discusses issues raised by various-commenters in the areas of the use of self-service displays , vending-machines , restrictions on sponsorship of events except in the corporate-name and loss of employment and maintains its conclusion that there would be no `` taking '' under the order . the fda 's position is that reductions in personal-property 's value , even prohibitions on all economically-viable uses , and financial expenditures to comply with a regulatory-requirement do not necessarily establish a taking , citing various-court-decisions for support . the fda did not identify any other statute or executive-order imposing procedural-requirements relevant to the rule . page 5 gao/ogc-96-38
