bryant seeks to help rent-to-own tenants lynchburg virginia by michael hewlett the news & advance the eviction of three lynchburg-women and four children last summer , partly as a result of a `` rent-to-own '' contract , has drawn the attention of the general assembly . but a bill drafted by del . preston bryant , r-lynchburg , wo n't be addressed until next year after the virginia housing commission , prompted by a senate joint resolution , offers its recommendations based on a statewide-study of rent-to-own-contracts and other housing-issues . bryant said he read about the issue in a july news & advance editorial . the editorial stemmed from a news & advance article which highlighted three women and four children who were being evicted after their home at 1328 bedford ave. , was cited for two dozen-code-violations . the women had been paying $ 425 a month in a rent-to-own agreement for five years , or roughly $ 25,500 . they still had another 10 years to go to complete the contract . `` i called the virginia legal-aid society and also talked to ( city-attorney ) walter erwin and ( housing authority executive director ) ed mccann about it , '' bryant said monday . `` i asked them to take a look at this issue as an ad hoc committee . '' `` i was a little-concerned about it and wanted to see if there was any reasonable-steps that could be taken to help protect folks that are not overly-burdensome . '' bryant 's bill , house bill 1122 , requires all rent-to-own-contracts to be recorded in the land-deeds where the property is located along with any documents indicating the financial arrangement . it also requires landlords to have their property inspected prior to tenants signing a rent-to-own-contract and to provide the tenant with the inspection-report . `` many times , those entering into these contracts are your less sophisticated-people , '' bryant said . `` and while i do n't think we as a government can protect everybody we can take some steps to help protect people . '' lawyers say the rent-to-own-contracts are legal but the contracts do tend to take advantage of people with limited options . `` we always tell people not to sign those , '' said renae patrick , managing-attorney at lynchburg 's virginia legal-aid society , in a june 27 , 2001 article about rent-to-own-contracts . commissioners with the lynchburg-redevelopment and housing authority approved last september a resolution that would require inspections every time a tenant moved out . that proposal also required an inspection before a new tenant signs a rent-to-own-contract . the resolution must come before city council for final-action . city manager kim payne said city council will look at that resolution as part of the budget-process . `` the rental-program is under discussion but beyond that there has n't been much-activity , '' he said . the city started the rental-inspection-program in 1994 in an attempt to crack down on property-owners who fail to maintain their homes , whether split into apartments or rented as a single-family residence . the program gets its geographic-boundaries from census-tracks and roughly covers much of white rock hill , college hill , tinbridge hill and the lower rivermont-area . payne said he and other administrators are looking at how broad the rental-inspection-program should be and whether the changes will mean more staffing and more money . `` i would guess that decision will have to be made as we move through the budget-process , '' payne said . city administrators will present their budget-proposal to city council in mid-march . `` i applaud del . bryant for introducing the bill , '' payne said . `` it 's consistent with council 's concerns and that of the housing authority . if it 's not a statewide-issue , it 's an issue in lynchburg .
