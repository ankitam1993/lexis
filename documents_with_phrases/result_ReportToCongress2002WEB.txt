report to the congress : authority of the united states postal-service to introduce new products and services and to enter into rate and service-agreements with individual-customers or groups of customers united states of america postal-rate commission february 11 , 2002 postal-rate commission memorandum february 11 , 2002 to : senate committee on appropriations house committee on appropriations senate committee on governmental affairs house committee on government-reform subject : report to the congress on authority of the united states postal-service to introduce innovative products and services and to enter into rate and service-agreements in accordance with the direction of the joint-committee of conference concerning the 2002 appropriation for the postal-service , the postal-rate commission hereby transmits its report on the scope of existing-authority of the united states postal-service under current postal-laws and regulations to introduce new products and services and to enter into negotiated service-agreements with individual-customers or groups of customers . respectfully submitted , george a. omas , chairman ruth y. goldway , vice chairman dana b. covington , sr. , commissioner report to the congress : appendix postal-service product innovations and special-purpose mail-classification-changes reviewed by the postal-rate commission since january 1 , 2000 i . summary this report provides an analysis of the united states postal-service 's current legal-authority to : ( 1 ) introduce and provide new products and services ; and ( 2 ) enter into negotiated service-agreements with individual-customers . this report also includes background on the use of such authority within the past two years . the commission 's analysis of existing postal-law yields the following-conclusions : • the postal-reorganization act of 1970 gives the united states postal-service a clear-mandate to innovate by developing effective and efficient-services adapted to the needs of the nation 's mail-users . • the mechanism for implementing-innovations in domestic-mail services is the joint-authority shared by the postal-service and the postal-rate commission to adopt new mail-classifications under 39 u.s.c . §§ 3623 through 3625 . • the postal-rate commission has developed specialized procedural-rules that provide for expeditious-consideration of proposed service-innovations in a manner consistent with the due-process-rights of other interested-persons . • negotiated service-agreements ( nsas ) or `` niche-classifications '' are rate and service-adjustments arranged by the postal-service and potential-users that are legally-permissible , provided that : ❶ the proposal is reviewed in a public-proceeding , as the reorganization-act requires ; ❷ the agreed-upon-rate and service-changes will work to the mutual-benefit of mail-users and the postal-system as a whole ; and ❸ the negotiated rate-and-service-package is made available on the same terms to other potential-users willing to meet the same conditions of service . ii . background and scope of analysis in joint-deliberations on appropriations for the united states postal-service and certain other agencies and departments for fiscal year 2002 , the committee of conference directed both the postal-service and the postal-rate commission to prepare reports on particular-areas of the postal-service 's authority under existing law.1 specifically , the conferees directed : …both the united states postal-service and the postal-rate commission to independently report , 90 days after enactment of this act , on the scope of existing-authority of the us postal-service , under title 39 , united states code , and title 39 , code of federal-regulations , to introduce and provide new products and services ( including the introduction and provision of new products and service on an experimental or market-test-basis ) and to enter into negotiated service-agreements with individual-customers or groups of customers . such reports shall include background on the use of such authority within the past 24 months and shall be provided to the committees on appropriations , the senate committee on governmental affairs , and the house committee on government-reform . h. r. conf . rep. no . 107-253 , 107th cong. , 1st sess . 59 ( 2001 ) . as directed , the commission submits this report to the senate and house of representatives committees on appropriations , the senate committee on governmental affairs , and the house committee on government-reform . the report is presented in three sections . the first outlines the postal-service 's current legal-authority to introduce new products and services , the role of the postal-rate commission in that process , and the procedural-mechanisms available for expedited approval of such innovations . the second section addresses the same topics in connection with negotiated service-agreements ( nsas ) , so-called `` niche-classifications , '' which are special-service and rate-arrangements negotiated between the postal-service and a particular-mailer or groups of mailers with features tailored to their use of the postal-system . finally , an appendix to the report summarizes recent 1 the amended bill produced by the conference-committee was enacted as pub . l. no . 107-67 , 115 stat . 514 ( 2001 ) . commission proceedings in which the postal-service has sought to introduce service-innovations-some of them customized for particular-groups of mailers-on an expedited-basis . iii . postal-service authority to develop , introduce and provide new products and services a . innovation under the postal-reorganization act while pre-existing-law afforded limited-opportunities for postal innovation,2 the postal-reorganization act of 1970 gave the newly-created united states postal-service a clear-mandate to innovate by developing effective and efficient-services adapted to the needs of the nation 's mail-users . section 101 ( a ) of title 39 establishes the postal-service 's paramount-obligation `` to provide postal-services to bind the nation together through the personal , educational , literary , and business-correspondence of the people . '' the same section establishes the performance-criterion that the postal-service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal-policy : '' it shall provide prompt , reliable , and efficient-services to patrons in all areas and . . . all communities . '' similarly , § 403 ( a ) assigns the postal-service the duty to `` plan , develop , promote , and provide adequate and efficient postal-services at fair and reasonable-rates and fees . '' the act fosters service-innovation by assigning the postal-service responsibility `` to provide types of mail-service to meet the needs of different-categories of mail and mail-users [ . ] '' 39 u.s.c . § 403 ( b ) ( 2 ) . the reorganization-act grants the postal-service specific-powers that serve as the operational-tools of service-innovation . section 404 of title 39 grants the postal-service plenary-authority over custody of the mail and its movement [ § 404 ( a ) ( 1 ) ] ; over the deployment of post-offices , other facilities , and equipment [ § 404 ( a ) ( 3 ) ] ; and over the means by which stamps and other postage are sold [ § 404 ( a ) ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ] . the same section also authorizes the postal-service `` to provide , establish , change , or abolish special-nonpostal or similar-services [ . ] '' 39 u.s.c . § 404 ( a ) ( 6 ) . conclusion : the postal-reorganization act of 1970 clearly mandates that the postal-service innovate by developing effective and efficient postal-services adapted to the needs of the nation's mail-users . 2 former 39 u.s.c . § 504 ( a ) authorized the postmaster general to maintain a research and development-program , and to conduct experiments to enhance the operational-efficiency and economy of the postal-system . b . commission review of proposed-changes in domestic-mail classifications prior to 1970 , the array of mail-services provided by the post-office department was codified as part of title 39.3 the reorganization-act replaced this statutory-codification of postal-services with an administrative-process in which the governors of the postal-service establish , and the postal-rate commission reviews proposed-changes in , the terms and conditions of postal-services , which are compiled as the domestic-mail classification schedule ( or `` dmcs '' ) .4 section 3621 of title 39 provides that `` the governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable-classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter . '' section 3623 ( a ) directs the postal-service to file a request with the postal-rate commission for a recommended-decision on establishing a mail-classification-schedule within two years of the reorganization-act 's effective-date . the postal-service complied with this requirement early in 1973 , and a domestic-mail classification schedule recommended by the commission became effective on july 6 , 1976.5 following-establishment of this initial-mail-classification schedule , § 3623 ( b ) provides that the postal-service `` may from time to time request that the commission submit , or the commission may submit to the governors on its own initiative , a recommended-decision on changes in the mail-classification-schedule . '' deliberations on proposed mail-classification-changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record-hearings is afforded to mail-users and an officer of the commission required to represent the interests of the general-public . 39 u.s.c . § 3624 ( a ) . the commission 's procedural-rules governing proposed-changes in the mail-classification-schedule are contained in subpart c of title 39 of the code of federal-regulations , 39 c.f.r . § 3001.61 et seq . 3 see former-title 39 , part iv-mail matter . 4 the text of the domestic-mail classification schedule is published as appendix a to subpart c of 39 c.f.r . part 3001 , following 39 c.f.r . § 3001.68 5 docket no . mc73-1 , phase i , opinion and recommended-decision , april 15 , 1976 ; accepted in decision of the governors of the united states postal-service on establishing a mail-classification-schedule , june 2 , 1976 . over the past 25 years , the postal-service has filed many such mail-classification-requests with the commission , seeking either to establish new postal-products or to reconfigure pre-existing services . less frequently , the commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative , most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so . both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful-opportunities to introduce innovations in postal-services . conclusion : the joint-authority shared by the postal-service and the postal-rate commission under the reorganization-act to adopt new mail-classifications is the mechanism for implementing-innovations in domestic-mail-service . c. commission procedures adapted to the expeditious-consideration of proposed service-innovations recognizing that certain-types of proposed service-innovations merit-consideration under specialized procedures , the commission has adopted several-sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of postal-service requests . the rules depart from those generally-applicable to proposed mail-classification-changes by reducing the amount of supporting-evidence the postal-service is required to produce , and by expediting the commission 's procedural schedule for considering the particular-form of proposed change . the commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate postal-service mail-classification-requests involving proposed new services , or changes in existing-services , that were intended to serve as experiments . the rules , contained in 39 c.f.r . §§ 3001.67 through .67d , provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type-hearing is required ; allow the postal-service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed ; and provide for data-collection for the duration of the experiment . the experimental rules also incorporate a procedural-time-limit of 150 days from the commission 's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature . these rules were not used extensively . a joint postal service-postal rate commission task-force suggested a number of areas where additional special-rules might further encourage postal-service innovation.6 the postal-service petitioned the commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations . the commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the service 's petition , and after considering the comments of interested parties , implemented four of the proposed initiatives , albeit in revised form . three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited-procedures for particular-categories of postal-service requests . the fourth-set specifies conditions under which the service may use multi-year test-periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time . the first set of these new procedural-rules , incorporated into the commission 's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited-procedures for consideration of postal-service proposed market-tests of potential new services . the rules specify the limited-information the service is required to file in support of a proposed market-test , including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data-collection and reporting-requirements . they also streamline public-notice and hearing procedures , and provide for issuance of a `` yes or no '' commission-decision on the proposed market-test within 90 days , consistent with the procedural due-process-rights of interested-persons . the postal-service 's innovative-mailing online service , for which a three-year experimental-trial was requested and approved in docket no . mc2000-2 , was initially considered and recommended by the commission under the market-test-rules . see the appendix to this report under the heading for docket no . mc2000-2 . the second set of rules,8 apply to postal-service proposals to implement new services that would supplement , but not alter , existing-mail-classifications and rates on a provisional-basis for a limited-time . as in the market-test-rules , the provisional service-rules identify the supporting-information to be provided by the postal-service ; in addition , they allow the service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 see postal-ratemaking in a time of change : a report by the joint task-force on postal-ratemaking , june 1 , 1992 . 7 39 c.f.r . §§ 3001.161-.166 . 8 39 c.f.r . §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the commission 's general-rules for mail-classification-proposals . the rules likewise expedite public-notice and procedural-scheduling , providing for a `` yes or no '' commission-decision within 90 days , consistent with the due-process-rights of other parties . a third-set of rules , adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to postal-service requests for permanent-mail-classification changes that are minor in character . `` minor '' classification-changes are defined as those that would not change any existing-rate or fee ; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing ; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated-contribution of the affected mail subclass or service-category to the institutional-costs of the postal-service . the rules specify limited required supporting-information , allow the service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data , and also streamline procedural-scheduling . under these rules for minor-classification-proposals , the procedural-deadline for rendering a commission-decision is 90 days from the filing of the postal-service request if no hearings are held , and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case . finally , the fourth-set of rules , contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice , 10 applies to postal-service requests for new services that it believes can not recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation . in such instances , the service 's request must be supported by testimony of a postal-service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year-test-period . the request should also provide return on investment projections , other available financial analyses , and cost , revenue , and volume-estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test-period . the rules establish a policy-standard that allows test-periods of up to five fiscal-years for the purpose of determining-breakeven for newly introduced postal-services . the commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996 , to be effective for a period of five years . in light of their apparent workability in several commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural-flexibility to the 9 39 c.f.r . §§ 3001.69-69c . 10 39 c.f.r . §§ 3001.181-.182 . postal-service , the commission extended their application for an additional five-year-period in a recent rulemaking.11 conclusion : specialized postal-rate commission rules of procedure are currently-available for use by the postal-service to provide expeditious-consideration of proposed service-innovations in a manner consistent with the due-process-rights of all interested-persons . 11 docket no . rm2001-3 , order no . 1322 , 66 fed . reg . 54436 ( 2001 ) . iv . postal-service authority to enter into negotiated rate and service-agreements with individual-customers or groups of customers to provide services for a number of years , some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal-rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the postal-service . depending on their respective-objectives and features , contractual-arrangements of this kind have been labeled `` contract-rates , '' `` negotiated service-agreements , '' or more recently , `` niche-classifications . '' in addressing the consistency of these various-approaches with current-law , it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics . for example , the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory-scrutiny , or instead submitted for some form of review by the postal-rate commission prior to its effectiveness . a. statutory-bases of potential authority no provision in existing-law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the postal-service from entering into rate or service-agreements with mail-users . section 401 ( 3 ) of title 39 generally empowers the service `` to enter into and perform contracts , '' and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the postal-service and mail-users negotiating and reaching-consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed . however , other provisions in title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the service 's authority under § 401 ( 3 ) is sufficiently-broad to encompass changes in rates or mail-classifications by agreement alone . the obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive . from a procedural-perspective , the legal-soundness of rate or mail-classification-changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the reorganization-act are the procedures prescribed in chapter 36 of title 39 . these provisions require that rate or mail-classification-changes desired by the postal-service must be filed as a request with the postal-rate commission , allowing for public-scrutiny and deliberations by the commission and the governors of the postal-service . failure to abide by the procedural-requirements of chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal-basis for voiding the intended change.12 negotiated rate or service-changes also may run afoul of the substantive-standards prescribed for rates and mail-classifications in the reorganization-act . section 403 ( c ) of title 39 directs that : in providing-services and in establishing-classifications , rates , and fees under this title , the postal-service shall not , except as specifically authorized in this title , make any undue or unreasonable-discrimination among users of the mails , nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable-preferences to any such user . sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity , together with other criteria , as considerations to be observed in making-rate and mail-classification-changes . without public-scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the postal-service and a customer , there could be no assurance that these substantive-criteria would be satisfied . however , assuming the procedural-requirements of chapter 36 are met , changes negotiated by the postal-service and a mail-user for their mutual-benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory-standards . section 3623 ( c ) directs the commission to consider `` the desirability and justification for special-classifications and services of mail '' [ § 3623 ( c ) ( 2 ) ] and `` the desirability of special-classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the postal-service '' [ § 3623 ( c ) ( 5 ) ] . regarding-rates , § 3622 ( b ) ( 6 ) establishes `` the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal-system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing-costs to the postal-service '' as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change . in combination with other factors and the policies of the reorganization-act , these 12 united parcel-service v. u. s. postal-service , 455 f.supp . 857 ( e.d . pa. 1978 ) , affirmed , 604 f.2d 1370 ( 3d cir . 1979 ) , cert . denied , 446 u.s. 957 ( 1980 ) . considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification-changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular-mailers . conclusion : rate and service-agreements negotiated by the postal-service and mail-users are permissible under current-law if the procedural and substantive-requirements of the postal-reorganization act are satisfied . b. problematical `` contract-rates '' in a rulemaking-proceeding conducted in the late-1980s at the request of a mailer , the commission addressed the question of the postal-service 's authority to negotiate rate-changes in the form of a proposal to recognize `` contract-rates . '' after considering-comments of the postal-service and other participants , the commission found the proposal-problematical , and declined to pursue it . the initial-proposal , considered in docket no . rm89-5 , included two variants : 1 . the commission might , after considering-cost and other relevant-evidence , establish a range of permissible-rates for particular-subclasses , with the postal-service and individual mailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this range ; or 2 . the postal-service and one or more mailers would negotiate a rate and service-package which would then ( i ) be submitted to the commission for a review , and ( ii ) thereafter be available on the same terms to all potential-users . the commission solicited two rounds of comments on the proposal from interested parties . the proponent and one other mailer took the position that the postal-service is authorized to enter into such contracts , provided the procedural-requirement of review under chapter 36 is observed . other commenters-including the commission's office of consumer advocate-expressed-doubts regarding the legal-soundness of one or both of the proposed variants of such agreements . the postal-service commented that , in its view , legal constraints would not preclude a contract-mechanism in principle , but that no such arrangement would be permissible without the commission 's participation in accordance with 39 u.s.c . §§ 3622 through 3625 . upon consideration of the initial-comments it received , the commission declined to pursue the contract-rate-proposal , but solicited further comments on several broad-issues concerning possible-changes in the mail-classification-system . the commission explained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract-rates was based on substantial-uncertainty regarding the legal sufficiency of examining agreed-upon-rates after the fact , rather than in a prior-review . it also raised the potential-problems of unreasonable-discrimination that such contracts might cause , in contravention of 39 u.s.c . § 403 ( c ) , and the preservation of fair-contributions to the postal-service 's institutional-costs by mail volumes.13 such problems might well arise if the service were to negotiate '' discounted '' rates-unaccompanied by a change in service-conditions that provided cost or revenue-justification . conclusion : negotiated rates-unaccompanied by a change in service-conditions that provides cost-justification-are a problematical-approach to introducing additional-flexibility into postal-service business-practices . c. negotiated service-agreements and specialized `` niche-classifications '' following-publication of the report of the joint postal service-postal rate commission task-force on ratemaking , the postal-service petitioned the commission to adopt rules to implement some of the report 's recommendations . one recommendation included in the service 's petition was adoption of commission rules for reviewing on an expedited-basis `` service-agreements with postal-customers , varying from the general-rate and classifications schedules in ways which add value both for the customer and for the postal-system as a whole . `` 14 the proposal in the postal-service 's petition would have established negotiated service-agreements as a new form of mail-classification , with individual-agreements to be reviewed by the commission within 60 days . in the commission 's notice of proposed-rulemaking , it deferred consideration of the nsa proposal , citing legal-uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rates with the reorganization act's 13 docket no . rm89-5 , further invitation for comments , 54 fed . reg . 47223 ( 1989 ) . 14 postal-ratemaking in a time of change , supra , at 54. ratemaking-provisions . however , the commission also expressed a general-willingness to address the concept in a subsequent rulemaking . since then , the commission has conducted several-mail classification-proceedings under the other expedited-procedures adopted in that rulemaking . these procedures have been shown to be well suited to the consideration of `` niche-classification '' proposals . niche-classifications are specialized mail classifications- including reduced , but cost-justified-rates or fees-that have been developed by the postal-service in direct consultation with its customers , to meet the needs and capabilities of a mailer or group of mailers . for example , the commission approved a two-year-experiment of a program that enabled-users of bulk , nonletter-size business reply mail such as photofinishers that could reliably determine postage and fees due , to obtain earlier access to their mail at revised fees.15 the commission subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment,16 and ultimately approved a request to make the experimental-program a permanent mail classification.17 more recently , in docket no . mc2001-1 , the commission recommended three new worksharing-based discounted priority mail categories after negotiating with mailers who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could reduce the postal-service 's costs.18 such `` niche-classification '' proposals are essentially negotiated service-agreements , without any associated legal-uncertainties or additional administrative-barriers . conclusion : rate and service-adjustments agreed upon by the postal-service and mailers are legally authorized if three conditions are satisfied : ❶ the proposal is reviewed in a public-proceeding , as the reorganization-act requires ; ❷ the agreed-upon-rate and service-changes will work to the mutual-benefit of mail-users and the postal-system as a whole ; and 15 docket no . mc97-1 , opinion and recommended-decision , april 2 , 1997 . 16 docket no . mc99-1 , opinion and recommended-decision approving revised stipulation and

❸ the negotiated rate-and-service-package is made available on the same terms to other potential-users willing to meet the same conditions of service . examples of `` niche-classification '' proposals recommended in recent commission proceedings , and postal-service product innovations considered in other cases , are described in the appendix to this report . report to the congress appendix feb. 11
