court keeps judge from distributing funds to legal-aid-groups ; nixon is challenging his authority to spend up to $ 750,000 virginia young post-dispatch jefferson city bureau the missouri court of appeals in st. louis has blocked a judge's proposal to give as much as $ 750,000 to organizations that provide legal-services for the poor . attorney-general jay nixon sought the order , which was granted wednesday on an emergency-basis . nixon wanted to prevent cole county circuit judge thomas brown iii from distributing the funds as early as today . nixon 's office is challenging brown 's authority to spend the money . an osage county judge who heard the dispute sided with brown in september , but nixon is appealing that decision . wednesday's action bars brown from transferring the money until the appeals court-rules . the funds are part of about $ 2.75 million in interest that accrued in several-state-cases brought on behalf of consumers . the attorney-general contends that the money belongs in the state's unclaimed-property-fund . brown decided last week to designate some of the money for four legal-aid-organizations , including the st. louis-based legal-services of eastern missouri . nixon 's spokeswoman , mary still , said the emergency-order `` was needed to keep the money in safekeeping , so it could be distributed to its rightful-owners . '' while legal-aid is a worthy-cause , nixon '' does n't believe the judge has legal-authority to give the money to that cause , '' she said . brown 's attorney , dale doerhoff , said wednesday 's action was unnecessary because brown never intended to distribute the money until all legal-questions about his authority were resolved . the money is left over from cases involving-utility-bill overpayments and an insurance-company-insolvency . brown and cole county circuit judge byron kinder used some of the money to remodel the cole county-courthouse and to pay additional-salaries to courthouse-secretaries .
