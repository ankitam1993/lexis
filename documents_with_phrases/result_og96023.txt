office of the general counsel b-272364.1 july 5 , 1996 the honorable john mccain chairman the honorable daniel k. inouye vice chairman committee on indian affairs united states senate the honorable don young chairman the honorable george miller ranking minority member committee on resources house of representatives subject : contracts under the indian-self-determination and education assistance act pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the department of the interior , bureau of indian affairs and the department of health and human-services , indian health services , entitled `` contracts under the indian-self-determination and education assistance act '' ( rins : 1076-ad21 and 0905-ac98 ) . we received the rule on june 21 , 1996 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on june 24 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 32481 . the joint-rule is issued to permit the departments to award contracts and grants to indian-tribes without the confusion associated with having two sets of rules for a single-program . this is the second attempt by the departments to issue such a rule . in 1988 , congress directed the two departments to develop regulations to implement amendments to the indian-self-determination act ( pub . l. 93-638 ) contained in the indian-self-determination and education assistance act amendments of 1988 gao/ogc-96-23 ( pub . l. 100-472 ) . those amendments were intended to increase tribal-participation in the management of federal indian programs and to help ensure long-term financial-stability for tribal-run programs . when the proposed regulation was published for public-comment ( 59 fed . reg . 3166 ) , reaction was critical over the lack of tribal-participation in the latter-stages of the drafting-process and the overall-length of the proposed regulation . a congressional-reexamination of the regulation drafting-process led to the passage of the indian-self-determination act amendments of 1994 ( pub . l. 103-413 ) . this act removed congress ' prior delegation of the departments ' general legislative-rulemaking authority under the act and limited it to certain subject-matter areas enumerated in the act . moreover , the act required the departments , in issuing any new rules in those areas , to utilize the negotiated rulemaking act of 1990 as a guide with the direct participation of tribal-representatives in the rulemaking . the departments chartered a negotiated rulemaking-committee under the federal advisory-committee act to develop this rule . the committee had 63 members including 48 members representing indian-tribes . the committee met between april 1995 and may 1996 . the rule is the result of consensus by the committee except in four areas : internal-agency-procedures , contract-renewal procedures , conflicts of interest and construction-management services . a delegation of tribal-representatives met with the chiefs of staff of the two departments to present the tribal-views of the unresolved-areas and the rule incorporates the decisions made based on that meeting . enclosed is our assessment of the department of the interior and the department of health and human-services ' compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the departments complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact james w. vickers , senior-attorney , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the department of the interior , bureau of indian affairs is victor s. rezendes , director for energy , resources , and science issues . mr. rezendes can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-3841 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the department of health and human-services , indian health services is david p. baine , director of health-care-delivery and quality-issues . mr. baine can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-7101 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : ada e. deer assistant secretary-indian affairs department of the interior michael h. trujillo , m.d. , m.ph . director , indian health service department of health and human-services enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the department of the interior , bureau of indian affairs and the department of health and human service , indian health service entitled `` contracts under the indian-self-determination and education assistance act '' ( rins : 1076-ad21 and 0905-ac98 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the departments have advised our office that they were not required to prepare and did not prepare a cost-benefit-analysis of the rule .
