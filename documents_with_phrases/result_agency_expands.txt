legal-services-agency expands by matt myerhoff published : friday , july 19 , 2002 pasadena -- neighborhood legal-services , which provides free legal-services to the poor , has expanded into the san gabriel and pomona-valleys , areas with large asian-populations , many of whom speak limited or no english . language is their biggest obstacle , but the asian communities' cultural-isolation and service providers ' lack of cultural expertise also play a part , said nls executive director neal dubovitz . and with 13 percent to 15 percent of the asian-population in the u.s. living below the poverty-line , nls services are badly needed , dubovitz said . `` although it is a significant-part of the poverty-population , asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor , '' he said . from simple-telephone-advice to complete legal-representation in court , the agency provides free-consumer , health , family , immigration , housing , public-benefits and labor legal-services to people who earn under $ 1,380 per month . legal-service-providers have long served large latino populations , who have cultural-diversity but share a common-language . `` i remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal-offices who spoke spanish , '' dudovitz said . `` now spanish and english are interchangeable . our goal is to have that for the major asian-languages as well . '' before the expansion , only a few nls-lawyers spoke asian-languages , said attorney rebecca yee , who was hired by nls in april 2002 to design and head the project . `` now we have people speaking-cantonese , mandarin , thai , khmer ( from cambodia ) , korean , vietnamese , japanese and tagalog , '' yee said . one of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is irene mak , a family-law-attorney who speaks cantonese , mandarin and thai . mak was a partner at a private-law-firm before she went to work for nls two years ago , earning up to $ 20,000 less a year working on domestic-violence-cases . `` the job is more satisfying than the money , '' said mak , who grew up in hong kong and thailand before coming to the united states . `` i could use my language-skills and wanted to give back to the asian community . '' nls expanded when legal-services corp. , the federal-agency that funds-providers of free legal-services nationwide , reduced the number of grantees in the los angeles area from five to three , dudovitz said . nls won the competitive-grant over the legal-services-program for pasadena , san gabriel-pomona-valleys . that boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000 , and nls opened an office in el monte .
