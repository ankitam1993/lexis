legal-services avoids budget-cut $ 19 million congressional-appropriation is good news for the national-nonprofit 's tuscaloosa-office by stephanie hoops january 26 , 2003 congress stepped in thursday to pass a $ 19 million appropriation for legal-services corp. , which serves the legal-needs of the poor through state-programs nationwide . the appropriation was good news for the six lawyers , one paralegal and three secretaries who work at tuscaloosa 's legal-services-office and receive salaries much less than those of employees at private-law-firms . from left , mary frances and artis '' i 'm ecstatic , '' said willie mays jones , managing-lawyer of the mckinney-talk to willie mays jones , tuscaloosa-office . `` we didn't know what was going to happen . '' managing-lawyer at legal services' tuscaloosa-office . the infusion of funds effectively saved alabama 's legal-services-programs , which have been scrambling to find funding amid layoffs and benefit-cuts . congress ' appropriation for lsc takes it from a budget of $ 329.3 million to $ 348.4 million , which will be divvied up nationwide . and it means alabama wo n't have a half-million-dollars cut from its budget as had been expected . instead , it will receive $ 6.4 million for fiscal year 2003 , the same as last year , said national lsc spokesman eric kleiman . `` it was like pennies from heaven , '' kleiman said . but alabama 's legal-services-programs still lack funds , said tracy daniel , executive director of the/salabama law foundation . `` we 're just treading-water , '' said daniel , whose organization gives money to lsc-programs in alabama . daniel said funding must be doubled in the next five years if legal-services is to continue to meet the needs of the poor . alabama spends less than $ 11 per eligible-person on legal-services , and the national average is $ 20 . the state is at the bottom of the nation in funding the services . `` we are dead last , '' said melinda waters , executive director of legal-services corp. of alabama , the largest of the state 's three lsc-programs . alabama 's legal-services-programs have been working with a statewide-task-force to find a way to improve its system . they've presented lsc in washington , d.c. , with a proposal to centralize the services into one program , which the national-office is expected to accept or reject next week . consolidation would be a big-change because the state has been operating for decades with three programs , which together serve the state 's 67 counties . waters ' program serves 60 counties , including tuscaloosa . the other two are legal-services of metro birmingham , which serves jefferson and shelby counties ; and legal-services of north central alabama , which serves madison , jackson , morgan , limestone and cullman-counties . `` the main-problem we 're facing-today is the fact that there are [ 698,079 ] people living at or below the federal-poverty-guidelines in alabama and we have , in our 60 counties , 45 lawyers to serve 76 percent of that population , '' waters said . the alabama state-bar volunteer-lawyers program helps the state to some extent . linda lund , program-director , said 25 percent of lawyers with an active-license-volunteer . some churches have programs as well , but lund said she has no data on them . `` i ca n't tell you how important i think a legal-services-program is , not only for alabama but for our country and system of government , '' lund said . `` if a large-portion of our population has no access to the third tier of government , they 're basically ostracized . '' even with the volunteer-lawyers , however , only 10 percent of the need is being met , daniel said . washington d.c.-based legal-services corporation , a private , non-profit-organization established by congress in 1974 , provides 85 percent of the funding for legal-services-programs nationwide . alabama 's funding comes primarily from the national lsc , with other funds coming from federal and private-grants , the alabama state-bar interest on lawyers-trust-accounts program and private-donations . the people who use legal-services include veterans , family-farmers and people with disabilities . legal-services provides lawyers to help them only with civil-legalities , such as consumer , family , housing and employment-law-matters . the services are free . only those whose incomes do not exceed 125 percent of the federal-poverty-level qualify for the services . mary frances mckinney saw her lawyer at tuscaloosa 's legal-services-office friday . mckinney 's house was sold in october on the tuscaloosa county-courthouse steps after she and her husband were sued by a local-business . legal-services is trying to get it back for the elderly-couple . mckinney said she would n't know what to do if legal-services were n't around . `` we 'd probably lose everything we had if we did n't have this place , '' she said . in west alabama , abused-women make regular-use of legal-services as well . last year at tuscaloosa 's turning point domestic-violence sexual assault services , half of the 160 women who sought-shelter used legal-services , said executive director kathy benitez . `` i had a client come in off the street one day and she said , `i 'm really-afraid he 's going to kill me this time , i need a protection from abuse-order . ' '' benitez said . `` so i immediately called legal-services and their attorney made an appointment with her , worked her in that afternoon . that 's just one recent example . '' the lawyers who work for alabama 's programs are not highly paid . starting-pay is only $ 31,196 , waters said . tax-records show waters earned around $ 65,000 in 2000 . by comparison , tax-records show the director of the program at the atlanta legal-aid society earned upwards of $ 80,000 during that time . but those who work for legal-services in alabama say the money is not why they entered the field . `` having grown up poor myself , i know that a lot of people are taken advantage of and need someone to advocate for them , '' said jones . jones has been with lsc of alabama 's tuscaloosa-office since 1986 . raised in housing-projects , she took the job after graduating from the university of alabama school of law because she wanted to give back to her community . `` i could have gone to a law firm and i would have made more money - a lot more money , '' jones said . `` i know that i 'm not getting paid as much as i could in the private sector , but i 'm doing a lot of good-work for people who really need it . '' waters said she 'd like to get an appropriation from the state-legislature to help legal-services in alabama , but she realizes that is unlikely , given the state of the economy . a better option might be to tack a filing-fee onto new cases filed in state-courts , with the money going to help fund legal-services , she said . that is how indigent criminal-defenders get paid . `` we ca n't lobby , '' she said . `` we do not have paid lobbyists and we are , in fact , a non-profit public-interest-law firm and that kind of approach to the legislature would require a lot of education . '' waters said the organization is already making difficult-decisions about who to turn away . `` unfortunately our clients , being poor , have nowhere else to turn for legal-representation , '' she said . `` so unlike people who are fortunate enough to be able to afford attorneys and can go to another lawyer , our clients are simply lost in the legal-system if they can not get access to it from us .
