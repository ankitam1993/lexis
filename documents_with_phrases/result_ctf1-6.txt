continued ) number page section 13 ( continued ) number page section 1 introduction 1.1 this manual describes chronic-toxicity-tests for use in the national pollutant discharge elimination system ( npdes ) permits program to identify effluents and receiving-waters containing toxic-materials in chronically toxic-concentrations . the methods included in this manual are referenced in table ia , 40 cfr part 136 regulations and , therefore , constitute approved methods for chronic-toxicity-tests . they are also suitable for determining the toxicity of specific-compounds contained in discharges . the tests may be conducted in a central-laboratory or on-site , by the regulatory-agency or the permittee . 1.2 the data are used for npdes-permits development and to determine compliance with permit-toxicity-limits . data can also be used to predict potential acute and chronic-toxicity in the receiving-water , based on the lc50 , noec , ic50 or ic25 ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-endpoints and data-analysis ) and appropriate-dilution , application , and persistence-factors . the tests are performed as a part of self-monitoring-permit-requirements , compliance biomonitoring-inspections , toxics sampling-inspections , and special-investigations . data from chronic-toxicity-tests performed as part of permit-requirements are evaluated during compliance-evaluation-inspections and performance-audit-inspections . 1.3 modifications of these tests are also used in toxicity reduction-evaluations and toxicity-identification-evaluations to identify the toxic-components of an effluent , to aid in the development and implementation of toxicity-reduction-plans , and to compare and control the effectiveness of various-treatment technologies for a given type of industry , irrespective of the receiving-water ( usepa , 1988c ; usepa , 1989b ; usepa 1989c ; usepa , 1989d ; usepa , 1989e ; usepa , 1991a ; usepa , 1991b ; and usepa , 1992 ) . 1.4 this methods-manual serves as a companion to the acute-toxicity-test methods for freshwater and marine-organisms ( usepa , 2002a ) , the short-term-chronic-toxicity test-methods for marine and estuarine-organisms ( usepa , 2002b ) , and the manual for evaluation of laboratories performing aquatic-toxicity-tests ( usepa , 1991c ) . in 2002 , epa revised previous-editions of each of the three methods-manuals ( usepa , 1993a ; usepa , 1994a ; usepa , 1994b ) . 1.5 guidance for the implementation of toxicity-tests in the npdes program is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxics control ( usepa , 1991a ) . 1.6 these freshwater short-term-toxicity-tests are similar to those developed for marine and estuarine-organisms to evaluate the toxicity of effluents discharged to marine and estuarine-waters under the npdes permit-program . methods are presented in this manual for three species of freshwater-organisms from three phylogenetic-groups . the methods are all static-renewal-type seven-day-tests except the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , test which lasts four days . 1.7 the three species for which test-methods are provided are the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas ; the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia ; and the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum . 1.7.1 two of the methods incorporate the chronic-endpoint of growth in addition to lethality and one incorporates reproduction . the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , embryo-larval-survival and teratogenicity-test incorporates teratogenic-effects in addition to lethality . the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , growth-test has the advantage of a relatively-short exposure period ( 96 h ) . 1.8 the validity of the freshwater chronic-methods in predicting adverse ecological-impacts of toxic-discharges was demonstrated in field-studies ( usepa , 1984 ; usepa , 1985b ; usepa , 1985c ; usepa , 1985d ; usepa , 1986a ; usepa , 1986b ; usepa , 1986c ; usepa , 1986d ; birge et al. , 1989 ; and eagleson et al. , 1990 ) . 1.9 the use of any test-species or test-conditions other than those described in the methods-summary-tables in this manual shall be subject to application and approval of alternate-test-procedures under 40 cfr 136.4 and 40 cfr 136.5 . 1.10 these methods are restricted to use by , or under the supervision of , analysts experienced in the use or conduct of aquatic-toxicity-tests and the interpretation of data from aquatic toxicity-testing . each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable-test-results with these methods using the procedures described in this methods-manual . 1.11 this manual was prepared in the established emsl-cincinnati format ( usepa , 1983 ) . section 2 short-term-methods for estimating chronic-toxicity 2.1 introduction 2.1.1 the objective of aquatic-toxicity-tests with effluents or pure-compounds is to estimate the `` safe '' or `` no effect '' concentration of these substances , which is defined as the concentration which will permit normal-propagation of fish and other aquatic-life in the receiving-waters . the endpoints that have been considered in tests to determine the adverse-effects of toxicants include death and survival , decreased-reproduction and growth , locomotor-activity , gill ventilation-rate , heart-rate , blood-chemistry , histopathology , enzyme-activity , olfactory function , and terata . since it is not feasible to detect and/or measure all of these ( and other possible ) effects of toxic-substances on a routine-basis , observations in toxicity-tests generally have been limited to only a few effects , such as mortality , growth , and reproduction . 2.1.2 acute-lethality is an obvious and easily observed-effect which accounts for its wide-use in the early-period of evaluation of the toxicity of pure-compounds and complex-effluents . the results of these tests were usually expressed as the concentration lethal to 50 % of the test-organisms ( lc50 ) over relatively-short exposure-periods ( one-to-four-days ) . 2.1.3 as exposure-periods of acute-tests were lengthened , the lc50 and lethal-threshold-concentration were observed to decline for many compounds . by lengthening the tests to include one or more complete-life-cycles and observing the more subtle-effects of the toxicants , such as a reduction in growth and reproduction , more accurate , direct , estimates of the threshold or safe-concentration of the toxicant could be obtained . however , laboratory-life-cycle tests may not accurately estimate the `` safe '' concentration of toxicants because they are conducted with a limited-number of species under highly controlled , steady-state-conditions , and the results do not include the effects of the stresses to which the organisms would ordinarily be exposed in the natural environment . 2.1.4 an early published account of a full-life-cycle , fish toxicity-test was that of mount and stephan ( 1967 ) . in this study , fathead-minnows , pimephales promelas , were exposed to a graded series of pesticide-concentrations throughout their life-cycle , and the effects of the toxicant on survival , growth , and reproduction were measured and evaluated . this work was soon followed by full-life-cycle-tests using other toxicants and fish-species . 2.1.5 mckim ( 1977 ) evaluated the data from 56 full-life-cycle-tests , 32 of which used the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , and concluded that the embryo-larval and early-juvenile-life-stages were the most sensitive-stages . he proposed the use of partial-life-cycle toxicity-tests with the early-life-stages ( els ) of fish to establish water-quality-criteria . 2.1.6 macek and sleight ( 1977 ) found that exposure of critical life-stages of fish to toxicants provides estimates of chronically-safe concentrations remarkably-similar to those derived from full-life-cycle toxicity-tests . they reported that `` for a great-majority of toxicants , the concentration which will not be acutely-toxic to the most sensitive-life-stages is the chronically-safe concentration for fish , and that the most sensitive-life-stages are the embryos and fry '' . critical-life-stage-exposure was considered to be exposure of the embryos during most , preferably all , of the embryogenic ( incubation ) period , and exposure of the fry for 30 days post-hatch for warm-water-fish with embryogenic-periods ranging from one-to-fourteen-days , and for 60 days post-hatch for fish with longer embryogenic-periods . they concluded that in the majority of cases , the maximum acceptable-toxicant-concentration ( matc ) could be estimated from the results of exposure of the embryos during incubation , and the larvae for 30 days post-hatch . 2.1.7 because of the high cost of full-life-cycle fish toxicity-tests and the emerging-consensus that the els test-data usually would be adequate for estimating chronically-safe concentrations , there was a rapid-shift by aquatic-toxicologists to 30 - 90-day els toxicity-tests for estimating chronically-safe concentrations in the late-1970s . in 1980 , usepa adopted the policy that els test-data could be used in establishing water-quality-criteria if data from full-life-cycle-tests were not available ( usepa , 1980a ) . 2.1.8 published reports of the results of els tests indicate that the relative-sensitivity of growth and survival as endpoints may be species dependent , toxicant dependent , or both . ward and parrish ( 1980 ) examined the literature on els tests that used embryos and juveniles of the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus , and found that growth was not a statistically-sensitive indicator of toxicity in 16 of 18 tests . they suggested that the els tests be shortened to 14 days posthatch and that growth be eliminated as an indicator of toxic-effects . 2.1.9 in a review of the literature on 173 fish full-life-cycle and els tests performed to determine the chronically-safe concentrations of a wide variety of toxicants , such as metals , pesticides , organics , inorganics , detergents , and complex-effluents , woltering ( 1984 ) found that at the lowest effect-concentration , significant-reductions were observed in fry-survival in 57 % , fry-growth in 36 % , and egg-hatchability in 19 % of the tests . he also found that fry-survival and growth were very often equally-sensitive , and concluded that the growth-response could be deleted from routine-application of the els tests . the net-result would be a significant-reduction in the duration and cost of screening-tests with no appreciable-impact on estimating-matcs for chemical-hazard-assessments . benoit et al . ( 1982 ) , however , found larval-growth to be the most significant-measure of effect , and survival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in early life-stage-tests with four organic-chemicals . 2.1.10 efforts to further reduce the length of partial-life-cycle toxicity-tests for fish without compromising their predictive-value have resulted in the development of an eight-day , embryo-larval-survival and teratogenicity-test for fish and other aquatic-vertebrates ( usepa , 1981 ; birge et al. , 1985 ) , and a seven-day-larval-survival and growth-test ( norberg and mount , 1985 ) . 2.1.11 the similarity of estimates of chronically-safe concentrations of toxicants derived from short-term , embryo-larval-survival and teratogenicity-tests to those derived from full-life-cycle-tests has been demonstrated by birge et al . ( 1981 ) , birge and cassidy ( 1983 ) , and birge et al . ( 1985 ) . 2.1.12 use of a seven-day , fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , larval-survival and growth-test was first proposed by norberg and mount at the 1983 annual-meeting of the society for environmental toxicology and chemistry ( norberg and mount , 1983 ) . this test was subsequently used by mount and associates in field-demonstrations at lima , oh ( usepa , 1984 ) , and at many other locations . growth was frequently found to be more sensitive than survival in determining the effects of complex-effluents . 2.1.13 norberg and mount ( 1985 ) performed three single-toxicant fathead-minnow larval-growth-tests with zinc , copper , and dursban® , using-dilution-water from lake superior . the results were comparable to , and had confidence-intervals that overlapped with , chronic-values reported in the literature for both els and full-life-cycle-tests . 2.1.14 mount and norberg ( 1984 ) developed a seven-day-cladoceran partial-life-cycle-test and experimented with a number of diets for use in culturing and testing the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-reticulata ( norberg and mount , 1985 ) . as different-laboratories began to use this cladoceran-test , it was discovered that apparently more than one species was involved in the tests conducted by the same laboratory . berner ( 1986 ) studied the problem and determined that perhaps as many as three variant-forms were involved and it was decided to recommend the use of the more common-ceriodaphnia-dubia rather than the originally reported ceriodaphnia-reticulata . the method was adopted for use in the first edition of the freshwater short-term chronic-methods ( usepa , 1985e ) . 2.1.15 the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , bottle-test was developed , after extensive-design , evaluation , and application , for the national eutrophication research-program ( usepa , 1971 ) . the test was later modified for use in the assessment of receiving-waters and the effects of wastes originating from industrial , municipal , and agricultural-point and non-point-sources ( usepa , 1978a ) . 2.1.16 the use of short-term-toxicity-tests including-subchronic and chronic-tests in the npdes program is especially-attractive because they provide a more direct-estimate of the safe-concentrations of effluents in receiving-waters than was provided by acute-toxicity-tests , at an only slightly increased level of effort , compared to the fish full-life-cycle-chronic and 28-day els tests and the 21-day daphnid , daphnia-magna , life-cycle-test . 2.2 types of tests 2.2.1 the selection of the test-type will depend on the npdes permit-requirements , the objectives of the test , the available-resources , the requirements of the test-organisms , and effluent characteristics such as fluctuations in effluent-toxicity . 2.2.2 effluent chronic-toxicity is generally measured using a multi-concentration , or definitive-test , consisting of a control and a minimum of five effluent-concentrations . the tests are designed to provide dose-response-information , expressed as the percent-effluent concentration that affects the hatchability , gross morphological-abnormalities , survival , growth , and/or reproduction within the prescribed-period of time ( four to seven days ) . the results of the tests are expressed in terms of the highest concentration that has no statistically-significant observed-effect on those responses when compared to the controls or the estimated-concentration that causes a specified-percent-reduction in responses versus the controls . 2.2.3 use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single-effluent concentration ( e.g. , the receiving-water-concentration or rwc ) and a control is not recommended . if the npdes permit has a whole effluent-toxicity-limit for acute-toxicity at the rwc , it is prudent to use that permit-limit as the midpoint of a series of five effluent-concentrations . this will ensure that there is sufficient-information on the dose-response-relationship . for example , the effluent-concentrations utilized in a test may be : ( 1 ) 100 % effluent , ( 2 ) ( rwc + 100 ) /2 , ( 3 ) rwc , ( 4 ) rwc/2 , and ( 5 ) rwc/4 . more specifically , if the rwc = 50 % , appropriate-effluent concentrations may be 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % , and 12.5 % . 2.2.4 receiving ( ambient ) water-toxicity-tests commonly employ two treatments , a control and the undiluted receiving-water , but may also consist of a series of receiving-water dilutions . 2.2.5 a negative-result from a chronic-toxicity-test does not preclude the presence of toxicity . also , because of the potential-temporal-variability in the toxicity of effluents , a negative-test-result with a particular-sample does not preclude the possibility that samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronic-toxicity . 2.2.6 the frequency with which chronic-toxicity-tests are conducted under a given npdes permit is determined by the regulatory-agency on the basis of factors such as the variability and degree of toxicity of the waste , production-schedules , and process-changes . 2.2.7 tests recommended for use in this methods-manual may be static-non-renewal or static-renewal . individual-methods specify which static-type of test is to be conducted . 2.3 static-tests 2.3.1 static-non-renewal tests - the test-organisms are exposed to the same test-solution for the duration of the test . 2.3.2 static-renewal-tests - the test-organisms are exposed to a fresh-solution of the same concentration of sample every 24 h or other prescribed-interval , either by transferring the test-organisms from one test-chamber to another , or by replacing all or a portion of solution in the test-chambers . 2.4 advantages and disadvantages of toxicity-test types 2.4.1 static-non-renewal , short-term-toxicity-tests : advantages : 1 . simple and inexpensive . 2 . very cost effective in determining-compliance with permit conditions . 3 . limited-resources ( space , manpower , equipment ) required ; would permit staff to perform many more tests in the same amount of time . 4 . smaller volume of effluent required than for static-renewal or flow-through-tests . disadvantages : 1 . dissolved oxygen ( do ) depletion may result from high chemical-oxygen-demand ( cod ) , biological-oxygen-demand ( bod ) , or metabolic-wastes . 2 . possible-loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or adsorption to the exposure-vessels . 3 . generally less sensitive than static-renewal , because the toxic-substances may degrade or be adsorbed , thereby reducing the apparent-toxicity . also , there is less chance of detecting-slugs of toxic-wastes , or other temporal-variations in waste-properties . 2.4.2 static-renewal , short-term-toxicity-tests : advantages : 1 . reduced possibility of do depletion from high cod and/or bod , or ill-effects from metabolic-wastes from organisms in the test-solutions . 2 . reduced possibility of loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or adsorption to the exposure-vessels . 3 . test-organisms that rapidly deplete-energy-reserves are fed when the test-solutions are renewed , and are maintained in a healthier-state . disadvantages : 1 . require greater volume of effluent than non-renewal-tests . 2 . generally less chance of temporal-variations in waste-properties . section 3 health and safety 3.1 general precautions 3.1.1 each laboratory should develop and maintain an effective-health and safety-program , requiring an ongoing-commitment by the laboratory-management . this program should include ( 1 ) a safety-officer with the responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a safety-program , ( 2 ) the preparation of a formal , written , health and safety-plan , which is provided to each of the laboratory-staff , ( 3 ) an ongoing-training-program on laboratory-safety , and ( 4 ) regularly scheduled , documented , safety-inspections . 3.1.2 collection and use of effluents in toxicity-tests may involve significant-risks to personal-safety and health . personnel collecting effluent-samples and conducting-toxicity-tests should take all safety-precautions necessary for the prevention of bodily injury and illness which might result from ingestion or invasion of infectious-agents , inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxic-substances through skin-contact , and asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen or presence of noxious-gases . 3.1.3 prior to sample-collection and laboratory-work , personnel will determine that all necessary-safety-equipment and materials have been obtained and are in good-condition . 3.1.4 guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous-materials must be strictly followed . 3.2 safety-equipment 3.2.1 personal-safety gear 3.2.1.1 personnel should use safety-equipment , as required , such as rubber-aprons , laboratory-coats , respirators , gloves , safety glasses , hard-hats , and safety-shoes . plastic netting on glass beakers , flasks , and other glassware minimizes breakage and subsequent-shattering of the glass . 3.2.2 laboratory-safety equipment 3.2.2.1 each laboratory ( including mobile-laboratories ) should be provided with safety-equipment such as first aid-kits , fire-extinguishers , fire-blankets , emergency-showers , chemical-spill clean-up-kits , and eye-fountains . 3.2.2.2 mobile-laboratories should be equipped with a telephone or other means to enable personnel to summon help in case of emergency . 3.3 general laboratory and field operations 3.3.1 work with effluents should be performed in compliance with accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardous-materials ( see safety-manuals listed in section 3 , health and safety , subsection 3.5 ) . it is recommended that personnel collecting-samples and performing-toxicity-tests not work alone . 3.3.2 because the chemical-composition of effluents is usually only poorly known , they should be considered as potential-health hazards , and exposure to them should be minimized . fume and canopy hoods over the toxicity-test-areas must be used whenever possible . 3.3.3 it is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the body immediately after collecting effluent-samples . 3.3.4 all containers are to be adequately labeled to indicate their contents . 3.3.5 staff should be familiar with safety-guidelines on material safety data sheets for reagents and other chemicals purchased from suppliers . incompatible-materials should not be stored together . good-housekeeping contributes to safety and reliable-results . 3.3.6 strong-acids and volatile organic-solvents employed in glassware-cleaning must be used in a fume-hood or under an exhaust canopy over the work-area . 3.3.7 electrical-equipment or extension-cords not bearing the approval of underwriter-laboratories must not be used . ground-fault interrupters must be installed in all `` wet '' laboratories where electrical-equipment is used . 3.3.8 mobile-laboratories should be properly grounded to protect against electrical-shock . 3.4 disease prevention 3.4.1 personnel handling-samples which are known or suspected to contain human-wastes should be immunized against tetanus , typhoid-fever , polio , and hepatitis b . 3.5 safety-manuals 3.5.1 for further guidance on safe-practices when collecting effluent-samples and conducting-toxicity-tests , check with the permittee and consult general-safety-manuals , including usepa ( 1986e ) and walters and jameson ( 1984 ) . 3.6 waste disposal 3.6.1 wastes generated during toxicity-testing must be properly handled and disposed of in an appropriate-manner . each testing facility will have its own waste-disposal-requirements based on local , state , and federal-rules and regulations . it is extremely-important that these rules and regulations be known , understood , and complied with by all persons responsible for , or otherwise involved in performing the toxicity-testing-activities . local-fire-officials should be notified of any potentially-hazardous conditions . section 4 quality-assurance 4.1 introduction 4.1.1 development and maintenance of a toxicity-test-laboratory quality-assurance ( qa ) program ( usepa , 1991a ) requires an ongoing-commitment by laboratory-management . each toxicity-test-laboratory should ( 1 ) appoint a quality-assurance-officer with the responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a qa program ; ( 2 ) prepare a quality-assurance-plan with stated data-quality objectives ( dqos ) ; ( 3 ) prepare a written description of laboratory standard-operating-procedures ( sops ) for culturing , toxicity-testing , instrument-calibration , sample-chain-of-custody procedures , laboratory sample tracking-system , glassware-cleaning , etc . ; and ( 4 ) provide an adequate , qualified technical-staff for culturing and testing the organisms , and suitable-space and equipment to assure reliable-data . 4.1.2 qa practices for toxicity-testing laboratories must address all activities that affect the quality of the final effluent-toxicity-test data , such as : ( 1 ) effluent-sampling and handling ; ( 2 ) the source and condition of the test-organisms ; ( 3 ) condition of equipment ; ( 4 ) test-conditions ; ( 5 ) instrument-calibration ; ( 6 ) replication ; ( 7 ) use of reference-toxicants ; ( 8 ) record keeping ; and ( 9 ) data-evaluation . 4.1.3 quality-control practices , on the other hand , consist of the more focused , routine , day-to-day-activities carried out within the scope of the overall qa program . for more detailed-discussion of quality-assurance and general-guidance on good-laboratory practices and laboratory-evaluation related to toxicity-testing , see fda , ( 1978 ) ; usepa , ( 1979d ) , usepa ( 1980b ) , usepa ( 1980c ) , and usepa ( 1991c ) ; dewoskin ( 1984 ) ; and taylor ( 1987 ) . 4.1.4 guidance for the evaluation of laboratories performing-toxicity-tests and laboratory-evaluation-criteria may be found in usepa ( 1991c ) . 4.2 facilities , equipment , and test-chambers 4.2.1 separate-test-organism culturing and toxicity-testing-areas should be provided to avoid possible-loss of cultures due to cross-contamination . ventilation-systems should be designed and operated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemical analysis-laboratories or sample-storage and preparation-areas into organism culturing or testing-areas , and from testing and sample-preparation-areas into culture-rooms . 4.2.2 laboratory and toxicity-test temperature-control equipment must be adequate to maintain recommended-test-water temperatures . recommended materials must be used in the fabrication of the test-equipment which comes in contact with the effluent ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment and supplies ; and specific toxicity-test-method ) . 4.3 test-organisms 4.3.1 the test-organisms used in the procedures described in this manual are the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , and the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum . the fish and invertebrates should appear healthy , behave normally , feed well , and have low-mortality in the cultures , during holding , and in test-controls . test-organisms should be positively identified to species ( see section 6 , test-organisms ) . 4.4 laboratory-water used for culturing and test-dilution-water 4.4.1 the quality of water used for test-organism-culturing and for dilution-water used in toxicity-tests is extremely-important . water for these two uses should come from the same source . the dilution-water used in effluent-toxicity-tests will depend in part on the objectives of the study and logistical-constraints , as discussed in detail in section 7 , dilution-water . for tests performed to meet npdes objectives , synthetic , moderately-hard water should be used . the dilution-water used for internal-quality assurance tests with organisms , food , and reference-toxicants should be the water routinely used with success in the laboratory . types of water are discussed in section 5 , facilities , equipment and supplies . water used for culturing and test-dilution should be analyzed for toxic-metals and organics at least annually or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting-minimum acceptability-criteria for control-survival and reproduction or growth . the concentration of the metals al , as , cr , co , cu , fe , pb , ni , and zn , expressed as total-metal , should not exceed 1 mg/l each , and cd , hg , and ag , expressed as total-metal , should not exceed 100 ng/l each . total-organochlorine-pesticides plus pcbs should be less than 50 ng/l ( apha , 1992 ) . pesticide-concentrations should not exceed usepa's ambient water-quality chronic-criteria-values where available . 4.5 effluent and receiving-water sampling and handling 4.5.1 sample holding-times and temperatures of effluent-samples collected for on-site and off-site-testing must conform to conditions described in section 8 , effluent and receiving-water sampling , sample handling , and sample preparation for toxicity-tests . 4.6 test-conditions 4.6.1 water-temperature should be maintained within the limits specified for each test . the temperature of test-solutions must be measured by placing the thermometer or probe directly into the test-solutions , or by placing the thermometer in equivalent-volumes of water in surrogate-vessels positioned at appropriate-locations among the test-vessels . temperature should be recorded continuously in at least one test-vessel for the duration of each test . test-solution temperatures should be maintained within the limits specified for each test . do concentration and ph should be checked at the beginning of each test and daily throughout the test-period . 4.7 quality of test-organisms 4.7.1 the health of test-organisms is primarily assessed by the performance ( survival , growth , and/or reproduction ) of organisms in control-treatments of individual-tests . the health and sensitivity of test-organisms is also assessed by reference-toxicant testing . in addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of test-organisms , reference-toxicant testing is used to initially demonstrate acceptable-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.15 ) and to document ongoing-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.16 ) . 4.7.2 regardless of the source of test-organisms ( in-house cultures or purchased from external-suppliers ) , the testing-laboratory must perform at least one acceptable-reference-toxicant test per month for each toxicity-test-method conducted in that month ( subsection 4.16 ) . if a test-method is conducted only monthly , or less frequently , a reference-toxicant test must be performed concurrently with each effluent-toxicity-test . 4.7.3 when acute or short-term-chronic-toxicity tests are performed with effluents or receiving-waters using-test-organisms obtained from outside the test-laboratory , concurrent-toxicity tests of the same type must be performed with a reference-toxicant , unless the test-organism supplier provides control-chart-data from at least the last five monthly-short-term chronic-toxicity-tests using the same reference-toxicant and control-conditions ( see section 6 , test-organisms ) . 4.7.4 the supplier should certify the species-identification of the test-organisms , and provide the taxonomic-reference ( citation and page ) or name ( s ) of the taxonomic-expert ( s ) consulted . 4.7.5 if routine-reference toxicant-tests fail to meet test-acceptability-criteria , then the reference-toxicant test must be immediately repeated . 4.8 food quality 4.8.1 the nutritional-quality of the food used in culturing and testing-fish and invertebrates is an important-factor in the quality of the toxicity-test-data . this is especially-true for the unsaturated fatty-acid-content of brine-shrimp-nauplii , artemia . problems with the nutritional-suitability of the food will be reflected in the survival , growth , and reproduction of the test-organisms in cultures and toxicity-tests . artemia-cysts , and other foods must be obtained as described in section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies . 4.8.2 problems with the nutritional-suitability of food will be reflected in the survival , growth , and reproduction of the test-organisms in cultures and toxicity-tests . if a batch of food is suspected to be defective , the performance of organisms fed with the new food can be compared with the performance of organisms fed with a food of known quality in side-by-side-tests . if the food is used for culturing , its suitability should be determined using a short-term-chronic-test which will determine the affect of food quality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant-test species in culture , using four replicates with each food-source . where applicable , foods used only in chronic-toxicity-tests can be compared with a food of known quality in side-by-side , multi-concentration-chronic-tests , using the reference-toxicant regularly employed in the laboratory qa program . 4.8.3 new batches of food used in culturing and testing should be analyzed for toxic-organics and metals or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting-minimum acceptability-criteria for control-survival and reproduction or growth . if the concentration of total-organochlorine-pesticides exceeds 0.15 mg/g wet-weight , or the concentration of total-organochlorine-pesticides plus pcbs exceeds 0.30 µg/g wet-weight , or toxic-metals ( al , as , cr , cd , cu , pb , ni , zn , expressed as total-metal ) exceed 20 µg/g wet-weight , the food should not be used ( for analytical-methods see aoac , 1990 and usda , 1989 ) . for foods ( e.g. , such as yct ) which are used to culture and test-organisms , the quality of the food should meet the requirements for the laboratory-water used for culturing and test-dilution-water as described in section 4.4 above . 4.9 acceptability of short-term-chronic-toxicity tests 4.9.1 for the tests to be acceptable , control-survival in fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , and the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , tests must be 80 % or greater . at the end of the test , the average dry-weight of surviving seven-day-old-fathead-minnows in control-chambers must equal or exceed 0.25 mg . in ceriodaphnia-dubia controls , 60 % or more of the surviving-females must have produced their third-brood in 7 ± 1 days , and the number of young per surviving-female must be 15 or greater . in algal-toxicity tests , the mean-cell-density in the controls after 96 h must equal or exceed 1 x 106 cells/ml and not vary more than 20 % among replicates . if these criteria are not met , the test must be repeated . 4.9.2 an individual-test may be conditionally-acceptable if temperature , do , and other specified-conditions fall outside specifications , depending on the degree of the departure and the objectives of the tests ( see test-condition-summaries ) . the acceptability of the test would depend on the experience and professional-judgment of the laboratory-investigator and the reviewing-staff of the regulatory-authority . any deviation from test-specifications must be noted when reporting-data from the test . 4.10 analytical-methods 4.10.1 routine-chemical and physical-analyses for culture and dilution-water , food , and test-solutions must include established quality-assurance-practices outlined in usepa methods-manuals ( usepa , 1979a and usepa , 1979b ) . 4.10.2 reagent-containers should be dated and catalogued when received from the supplier , and the shelf-life should not be exceeded . also , working-solutions should be dated when prepared , and the recommended shelf-life should be observed . 4.11 calibration and standardization 4.11.1 instruments used for routine-measurements of chemical and physical-parameters such as ph , do , temperature , and conductivity , must be calibrated and standardized according to instrument-manufacturer 's procedures as indicated in the general-section on quality-assurance ( see usepa methods 150.1 , 360.1 , 170.1 , and 120.1 in usepa , 1979b ) . calibration-data are recorded in a permanent-log-book . 4.11.2 wet-chemical-methods used to measure hardness , alkalinity and total residual-chlorine must be standardized prior to use each day according to the procedures for those specific usepa methods ( see usepa methods 130.2 and 310.1 in usepa , 1979b ) . 4.12 replication and test-sensitivity 4.12.1 the sensitivity of the tests will depend in part on the number of replicates per concentration , the significance-level selected , and the type of statistical-analysis . if the variability remains constant , the sensitivity of the test will increase as the number of replicates is increased . the minimum recommended-number of replicates varies with the objectives of the test and the statistical-method used for analysis of the data . 4.13 variability in toxicity-test-results 4.13.1 factors which can affect test-success and precision include ( 1 ) the experience and skill of the laboratory-analyst ; ( 2 ) test-organism-age , condition , and sensitivity ; ( 3 ) dilution-water-quality ; ( 4 ) temperature-control ; and ( 5 ) the quality and quantity of food provided . the results will depend upon the species used and the strain or source of the test-organisms , and test-conditions , such as temperature , do , food , and water-quality . the repeatability or precision of toxicity-tests is also a function of the number of test-organisms used at each toxicant-concentration . jensen ( 1972 ) discussed the relationship between sample-size ( number of fish ) and the standard-error of the test , and considered 20 fish per concentration as optimum for probit analysis . 4.14 test-precision 4.14.1 the ability of the laboratory-personnel to obtain consistent , precise-results must be demonstrated with reference-toxicants before they attempt to measure effluent-toxicity . the single-laboratory-precision of each type of test to be used in a laboratory should be determined by performing at least five tests with a reference-toxicant . 4.14.2 test-precision can be estimated by using the same strain of organisms under the same test-conditions and employing a known toxicant , such as a reference-toxicant . 4.14.3 interlaboratory-precision-data from a 1991 study of chronic-toxicity-tests with two species using the reference-toxicants potassium-chloride and copper-sulfate are shown in table 1 . table 2-shows-interlaboratory precision-data from a study of three chronic-toxicity-test methods using effluent , receiving-water , and reference-toxicant sample-types ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2001b ) . the effluent-sample was a municipal-wastewater spiked with kcl , the receiving waster-sample was a river-water spiked with kcl , and the reference-toxicant sample consisted of moderately-hard-synthetic freshwater spiked with kcl . additional-precision-data for each of the tests described in this manual are presented in the sections describing the individual-test-methods . table 1 . national interlaboratory-study of chronic-toxicity-test precision , 1991 :

interlaboratory-variability-study ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2001b ) . 2 represents the number of valid-tests ( i.e. , those that met-test acceptability-criteria ) that were used in the analysis of precision . invalid-tests were not used . 3 cvs based on total-interlaboratory-variability ( including both within-laboratory and between-laboratory-components of variability ) and averaged across sample-types . ic25s or ic50s were pooled for all laboratories to calculate the cv for each sample-type . the resulting-cvs were then averaged across sample-types . 4.14.4 additional information on toxicity-test-precision is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based control ( see pp . 2-4 , and 11-15 in usepa , 1991a ) . 4.14.5 in cases where the test-data are used in probit analysis or other point-estimation-techniques ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis ) , precision can be described by the mean , standard-deviation , and relative-standard-deviation ( percent-coefficient of variation , or cv ) of the calculated endpoints from the replicated-tests . in cases where the test-data are used in the linear-interpolation-method , precision can be estimated by empirical-confidence-intervals derived by using the icpin method ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis ) . however , in cases where the results are reported in terms of the no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) and lowest-observed-effect-concentration ( loec ) ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis ) precision can only be described by listing the noec-loec interval for each test . it is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly used statistic . however , when all tests of the same toxicant yield the same noec-loec interval , maximum-precision has been attained . the '' true '' no-effect-concentration could fall anywhere within the interval , noec ± ( noec minus loec ) . 4.14.6 it should be noted here that the dilution-factor selected for a test determines the width of the noec-loec interval and the inherent-maximum-precision of the test . as the absolute-value of the dilution-factor-decreases , the width of the noec-loec interval increases , and the inherent-maximum-precision of the test decreases . when a dilution-factor of 0.3 is used , the noec could be considered to have a relative-variability as high as ± 300 % . with a dilution-factor of 0.5 , the noec could be considered to have a relative-variability of ± 100 % . as a result of the variability of different-dilution-factors , usepa recommends the use of the dilution-factor of 0.5 or greater . other factors which can affect test-precision include : test-organism-age , condition , and sensitivity ; temperature-control ; and feeding . 4.15 demonstrating acceptable-laboratory-performance 4.15.1 it is a laboratory 's responsibility to demonstrate its ability to obtain consistent , precise-results with reference-toxicants before it performs toxicity-tests with effluents for permit-compliance-purposes . to meet this requirement , the intralaboratory-precision , expressed as percent-coefficient of variation ( cv % ) , of each type of test to be used in the laboratory should be determined by performing five or more tests with different-batches of test-organisms , using the same reference-toxicant , at the same concentrations , with the same test-conditions ( i.e. , the same test-duration , type of dilution-water , age of test-organisms , feeding , etc . ) , and the same data-analysis-methods . a reference-toxicant concentration-series ( 0.5 or higher ) should be selected that will consistently provide partial-mortalities at two or more concentrations . 4.16 documenting ongoing-laboratory-performance 4.16.1 satisfactory-laboratory-performance is demonstrated by performing at least one acceptable-test per month with a reference-toxicant for each toxicity-test-method conducted in the laboratory during that month . for a given test-method , successive-tests must be performed with the same reference-toxicant , at the same concentrations , in the same dilution-water , using the same data-analysis-methods . precision may vary with the test-species , reference-toxicant , and type of test . each laboratory 's reference toxicity-data will reflect conditions unique to that facility , including-dilution-water , culturing , and other variables ; however , each laboratory 's reference-toxicity-results should reflect good repeatability . 4.16.2 a control-chart should be prepared for each combination of reference-toxicant , test-species , test-conditions , and endpoints . toxicity-endpoints from five or six tests are adequate for establishing the control-charts . successive-toxicity-endpoints ( noecs , ic25s , lc50s , etc . ) should be plotted and examined to determine if the results ( x1 ) are within prescribed-limits ( figure 1 ) . the chart should plot logarithm of concentration on the vertical-axis against the date of the test or test number on the horizontal-axis . the types of control-charts illustrated ( see usepa , 1979a ) are used to evaluate the cumulative-trend of results from a series of samples , thus-reference toxicant-test-results should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of individual-effluent or receiving-water-tests . for endpoints that are ¯ point-estimates ( lc50s and ic25s ) , the cumulative-mean ( x ) and upper and lower control-limits ( ± 2s ) are recalculated with each successive-test-result . endpoints from hypothesis-tests ( noec , noaec ) from each test are plotted directly on the control-chart . the control-limits would consist of one concentration-interval above and below the concentration representing the central-tendency . after two years of data-collection , or a minimum of 20-data-points , the control-chart should be maintained using only the 20 most recent-data-points . 4.16.3 laboratories should compare the calculated cv ( i.e. , standard-deviation / mean ) of the ic25 for the 20 most recent-data-points to the distribution of laboratory-cvs reported nationally for reference-toxicant testing ( table 3-2 in usepa , 2000b ) . if the calculated cv exceeds the 75th-percentile of cvs reported nationally , the laboratory should use the 75th and 90th-percentiles to calculate warning and control-limits , respectively , and the laboratory should investigate options for reducing-variability . note : because noecs can only be a fixed-number of discrete-values , the mean , standard-deviation , and cv can not be interpreted and applied in the same way that these descriptive-statistics are interpreted and applied for continuous-variables such as the ic25 or lc50 . 4.16.4 the outliers , which are values falling outside the upper and lower control-limits , and trends of increasing or decreasing sensitivity , are readily identified . in the case of endpoints that are point-estimates ( lc50s and ic25s ) , at the p0.05 probability level , one in 20 tests would be expected to fall outside of the control-limits by chance alone . if more than one out of 20 reference-toxicant tests fall outside the control-limits , the laboratory should investigate sources of variability , take corrective-actions to reduce identified sources of variability , and perform an additional-reference toxicant-test during the same month . control-limits for the noecs will also be exceeded occasionally , regardless of how well a laboratory performs . in those instances when the laboratory can document the cause for the outlier ( e.g. , operator-error , culture-health or test-system failure ) , the outlier should be excluded from the future calculations of the control-limits . if two or more consecutive-tests do not fall within the control-limits , the results must be explained and the reference-toxicant test must be immediately repeated . actions taken to correct the problem must be reported . 4.16.5 if the toxicity-value from a given test with a reference-toxicant falls well outside the expected-range for the other test-organisms when using the standard-dilution-water and other test-conditions , the laboratory should investigate sources of variability , take corrective-actions to reduce identified sources of variability , and perform an additional-reference toxicant-test during the same month . performance should improve with experience , and the control-limits for endpoints that are point-estimates should gradually narrow . however , control-limits of ± 2s will be exceeded 5 % of the time by chance alone , regardless of how well a laboratory performs . highly proficient-laboratories which develop very narrow-control-limits may be unfairly penalized if a test-result which falls just outside the control-limits is rejected de facto . for this reason , the width of the control-limits should be considered in determining whether or not a reference-toxicant test-result falls `` well '' outside the expected-range . the width of the control-limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated cv ( i.e. , standard-deviation / mean ) of the ic25 for the 20 most recent-data-points to the distribution of laboratory-cvs reported nationally for reference-toxicant testing ( table 3-2 in usepa , 2000b ) . in determining whether or not a reference-toxicant test-result falls `` well '' outside the expected-range , the result also may be compared with upper and lower bounds for ±3s , as any result outside these control-limits would be expected to occur by chance only 1 out of 100 tests ( environment canada , 1990 ) . when a result from a reference-toxicant test is outside the 99 % confidence-intervals , the laboratory must conduct an immediate-investigation to assess the possible-causes for the outlier . 4.16.6 reference-toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of individual-effluent or receiving-water-tests . reference-toxicant testing is used for evaluating the health and sensitivity of organisms over time and for documenting initial and ongoing-laboratory-performance . while reference-toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto criterion for test-rejection , effluent and receiving-water-test results should be reviewed and interpreted in the light of reference-toxicant test results . the reviewer should consider the degree to which the reference-toxicant test-result fell outside of control-chart-limits , the width of the limits , the direction of the deviation ( toward increased test-organism sensitivity or toward decreased-test organism-sensitivity ) , the test-conditions of both the effluent-test and the reference-toxicant test , and the objective of the test . 4.17 reference-toxicants 4.17.1 reference-toxicants such as sodium-chloride ( nacl ) , potassium-chloride ( kcl ) , cadmium-chloride ( cdcl2 ) , copper-sulfate ( cuso4 ) , sodium-dodecyl-sulfate ( sds ) , and potassium-dichromate ( k2cr2o7 ) , are suitable for use in the npdes program and other agency-programs requiring aquatic-toxicity-tests . emsl-cincinnati hopes to release usepa-certified-solutions of cadmium and copper for use as reference-toxicants through cooperative-research and development-agreements with commercial-suppliers , and will continue to develop additional-reference-toxicants for future-release . standard reference-materials can be obtained from commercial-supply-houses , or can be prepared-inhouse using-reagent grade-chemicals . the regulatory-agency should be consulted before reference-toxicant ( s ) are selected and used . 4.18 record keeping 4.18.1 proper-record keeping is important . a complete-file should be maintained for each individual-toxicity-test or group of tests on closely related samples . this file should contain a record of the sample-chain-of-custody ; a copy of the sample-log-sheet ; the original-bench-sheets for the test-organism-responses during the toxicity-test ( s ) ; chemical-analysis-data on the sample ( s ) ; detailed records of the test-organisms used in the test ( s ) , such as species , source , age , date of receipt , and other pertinent-information relating to their history and health ; information on the calibration of equipment and instruments ; test-conditions employed ; and results of reference-toxicant tests . laboratory-data should be recorded on a real-time-basis to prevent the loss of information or inadvertent-introduction of errors into the record . original-data sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory-personnel performing the tests . 4.18.2 the regulatory-authority should retain records pertaining to discharge-permits . permittees are required to retain records pertaining to permit-applications and compliance for a minimum of 3 years [ 40 cfr 122.41 ( j ) ( 2 ) ] . section 5 facilities , equipment , and supplies 5.1 general requirements 5.1.1 effluent-toxicity-tests may be performed in a fixed or mobile-laboratory . facilities must include equipment for rearing and/or holding-organisms . culturing-facilities for test-organisms may be desirable in fixed-laboratories which perform large numbers of tests . temperature-control can be achieved using circulating-water-baths , heat-exchangers , or environmental-chambers . water used for rearing , holding , acclimating , and testing-organisms may be ground-water , receiving-water , dechlorinated-tap-water , or reconstituted synthetic-water . dechlorination can be accomplished by carbon-filtration , or the use of sodium-thiosulfate . use of 3.6 mg ( anhydrous ) sodium thiosulfate/l will reduce l.0 mg chlorine/l . after dechlorination , total residual-chlorine should be non-detectable . air used for aeration must be free of oil and toxic-vapors . oil-free air-pumps should be used where possible . particulates can be removed from the air using balston® grade bx or equivalent-filters , and oil and other organic-vapors can be removed using activated carbon-filters ( balston® , c-1 filter , or equivalent ) . 5.1.2 the facilities must be well ventilated and free from fumes . laboratory-ventilation-systems should be checked to ensure that return-air from chemistry-laboratories and/or sample holding areas is not circulated to test-organism culture-rooms or toxicity-test-rooms , or that air from toxicity-test-rooms does not contaminate-culture-areas . sample preparation , culturing , and toxicity-test-areas should be separated to avoid cross-contamination of cultures or toxicity-test-solutions with toxic-fumes . air-pressure differentials between such rooms should not result in a net-flow of potentially contaminated air to sensitive-areas through open or loosely- fitting-doors . organisms should be shielded from external-disturbances . 5.1.3 materials used for exposure-chambers , tubing , etc. , that come in contact with the effluent and dilution-water should be carefully chosen . tempered glass and perfluorocarbon-plastics ( teflon® ) should be used whenever possible to minimize sorption and leaching of toxic-substances . these materials may be reused following-decontamination . containers made of plastics , such as polyethylene , polypropylene , polyvinyl-chloride , tygon® , etc. , may be used as test-chambers or to ship , store and transfer effluents and receiving-waters , but they should not be reused unless absolutely-necessary , because they could carry over adsorbed-toxicants from one test to another , if reused . however , these containers may be repeatedly reused for storing-uncontaminated waters , such as deionized or laboratory-prepared-dilution-waters and receiving-waters . glass or disposable-polystyrene-containers can be used for test-chambers . the use of large ( $ 20 l ) glass-carboys is discouraged for safety-reasons . 5.1.4 new plastic-products of a type not previously used should be tested for toxicity before initial-use by exposing the test-organisms in the test-system where the material is used . equipment ( pumps , valves , etc . ) which can not be discarded after each use because of cost , must be decontaminated according to the cleaning procedures listed below ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment and supplies , subsection 5.3.2 ) . fiberglass and stainless-steel , in addition to the previously mentioned-materials , can be used for holding , acclimating , and dilution-water storage-tanks , and in the water-delivery-system , but once contaminated with pollutants the fiberglass should not be reused . all material should be flushed or rinsed thoroughly with the test-media before using in the test . 5.1.5 copper , galvanized-material , rubber , brass , and lead must not come in contact with culturing , holding , acclimation , or dilution-water , or with effluent-samples and test-solutions . some materials , such as several-types of neoprene-rubber ( commonly used for stoppers ) , may be toxic and should be tested before use . 5.1.6 silicone-adhesive used to construct glass-test-chambers absorbs some organochlorine and organophosphorus-pesticides , which are difficult to remove . therefore , as little of the adhesive as possible should be in contact with water . extra-beads of adhesive inside the containers should be removed . 5.2 test-chambers 5.2.1 test-chamber size and shape are varied according to size of the test-organism . requirements are specified in each toxicity-test-method . 5.3 cleaning test-chambers and laboratory apparatus 5.3.1 new plasticware used for sample-collection or organism exposure-vessels does not require thorough-cleaning before use . it is sufficient to rinse new sample-containers once with dilution-water before use . new glassware must be soaked overnight in 10 % acid ( see below ) and rinsed well in deionized-water and dilution-water . 5.3.2 all non-disposable-sample-containers , test-vessels , tanks , and other equipment that have come in contact with effluent must be washed after use to remove contaminants as described below . 1 . soak 15 min in tap-water and scrub with detergent , or clean in an automatic-dishwasher . 2 . rinse twice with tap-water . 3 . carefully rinse once with fresh , dilute ( 10 % , v : v ) hydrochloric or nitric-acid to remove scale , metals and bases . to prepare a 10 % solution of acid , add 10 ml of concentrated-acid to 90 ml of deionized-water . 4 . rinse twice with deionized-water . 5 . rinse once with full-strength , pesticide-grade-acetone to remove organic-compounds ( use a fume-hood or canopy ) . 6 . rinse three times with deionized-water . 5.3.3 special-requirements for cleaning glassware used in the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , toxicity-tests ( method 1003.0 , section 14 ) . prepare all graduated-cylinders , test-flasks , bottles , volumetric-flasks , centrifuge-tubes and vials used in algal-assays as follows : 1 . wash with non-phosphate detergent-solution , preferably heated to $ 50°c . brush the inside of flasks with a stiff-bristle brush to loosen any attached-material . the use of a commercial laboratory glassware-washer or heavy-duty-kitchen-dishwasher ( under-counter type ) is highly recommended . 2 . rinse with tap-water . 3 . test-flasks should be thoroughly rinsed with acetone and a 10 % solution ( by volume ) of reagent-grade hydrochloric-acid ( hcl ) . it may be advantageous to soak the flasks in 10 % hcl for several days . fill vials and centrifuge-tubes with the 10 % hcl solution and allow to stand a few minutes ; fill all larger containers to about one-tenth-capacity with hcl solution and swirl so that the entire-surface is bathed . 4 . rinse twice with millipore® milli-q® or qpak™2 , or equivalent , water . 5 . new test-flasks , and all flasks which through use may become contaminated with toxic organic-substances , must be rinsed with pesticide-grade-acetone or heat-treated before use . to thermally degrade-organics , place glassware in a high temperature oven at 400°c for 30 min . after cooling , go to 7 . if acetone is used , go to 6 . 6 . rinse thoroughly with millipore® milli-q® or qpak™2 , or equivalent-water , and dry in an 105°c oven . all glassware should be autoclaved before use and between uses . 7 . cover the mouth of each chamber with aluminum-foil or other closure , as appropriate , before storing . 5.3.4 the use of sterile , disposable-pipets will eliminate the need for pipet-washing and minimize the possibility of contaminating the cultures with toxic-substances . 5.3.5 all test-chambers and equipment must be thoroughly rinsed with the dilution-water immediately prior to use in each test . 5.4 apparatus and equipment for culturing and toxicity-tests 5.4.1 apparatus and equipment-requirements for culturing and testing are specified in each toxicity-test-method . also , see usepa , 2002a . 5.4.2 water purification-system 5.4.2.1 a good-quality , laboratory-grade deionized-water , providing a resistance of 18 megaohm-cm , must be available in the laboratory and in sufficient-quantity for laboratory-needs . deionized-water may be obtained from millipore® milli-q® , millipore® qpak™2 or equivalent-system . if large-quantities of high quality deionized-water are needed , it may be advisable to supply the laboratory-grade-deionizer with preconditioned-water from a culligan® , continental® , or equivalent mixed-bed-water-treatment system . 5.5 reagents and consumable-materials 5.5.1 sources of food for culture and toxicity-tests 1 . brine-shrimp , artemia sp. , cysts -- many commercial-sources of brine-shrimp-cysts are available . 2 . frozen-adult brine-shrimp , artemia -- available from most pet-supply-shops or other commercial-sources . 3 . flake-fish-food -- tetramin® and bioril® are available from most pet-shops . 4 . trout-chow -- available from commercial-sources . 5 . cereal-leaves , cerophyll® or equivalent -- available from commercial-sources . 6 . yeast -- packaged dry-yeast , such as fleischmann 's , or equivalent , can be purchased at the local-grocery-store or commercial-sources . 7 . alfalfa-rabbit-pellets -- available from feed-stores as purina-rabbit-chow . 8 . algae - available from commercial-sources . 5.5.1.1 all food should be tested for nutritional-suitability and chemically analyzed for organochlorine-pesticides , pcbs , and toxic-metals ( see section 4 , quality-assurance ) . 5.5.2 reagents and consumable-materials are specified in each toxicity-test-method section . also , see section 4 , quality-assurance . 5.6 test-organisms 5.6.1 test-organisms should be obtained from inhouse-cultures or from commercial-suppliers ( see specific-test-method ; section 4 , quality-assurance ; and section 6 , test-organisms ) . 5.7 supplies 5.7.1 see test-methods ( see sections 11-14 ) for specific-supplies . section 6 test-organisms 6.1 test-species 6.1.1 the species used in characterizing the chronic-toxicity of effluents and/or receiving-waters will depend on the requirements of the regulatory-authority and the objectives of the test . it is essential that good-quality test-organisms be readily-available throughout the year from inhouse or commercial-sources to meet npdes monitoring-requirements . the organisms used in the toxicity-tests must be identified to species . if there is any doubt as to the identity of the test-organism , representative-specimens should be sent to a taxonomic-expert to confirm the identification . 6.1.2 toxicity-test-conditions and culture-methods for the species listed in subsection 6.1.3 are provided in this manual also , see usepa , 2002a . 6.1.3 the organisms used in the short-term-chronic-toxicity tests described in this manual are the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia ( berner , 1986 ) , and the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum . 6.1.4 some states have developed culturing and testing-methods for indigenous-species that may be as sensitive , or more sensitive , than the species recommended in subsection 6.1.3 . however , usepa allows the use of indigenous-species only where state-regulations require their use or prohibit importation of the recommended-species in subsection 6.1.3 . where state-regulations prohibit importation of non-native-fishes or the use of recommended test-species , permission must be requested from the appropriate-state-agency prior to their use . 6.1.5 where states have developed culturing and testing-methods for indigenous-species other than those recommended in this manual , data comparing the sensitivity of the substitute-species and the one or more recommended-species must be obtained in side-by-side toxicity-tests with reference-toxicants and/or effluents , to ensure that the species selected are at least as sensitive as the recommended-species . these data must be submitted to the permitting-authority ( state or region ) if required . usepa acknowledges that reference-toxicants prepared from pure-chemicals may not always be representative of effluents . however , because of the observed and/or potential-variability in the quality and toxicity of effluents , it is not possible to specify a representative effluent . 6.1.6 guidance for the selection of test-organisms where the salinity of the effluent and/or receiving-water requires special-consideration is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxics control ( usepa , 1991a ) . 1 . where the salinity of the receiving-water is < 1‰ , freshwater-organisms are used regardless of the salinity of the effluent . 2 . where the salinity of the receiving-water is $ 1‰ , the choice of organisms depends on state water-quality standards and/or permit-requirements . 6.2 sources of test-organisms 6.2.1 the test-organisms recommended in this manual can be cultured in the laboratory using-culturing and handling-methods for each organism described in the respective test-method sections . the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , culture-method is given in section 11 and not repeated in section 12 . also , see usepa ( 2002a ) . 6.2.2 inhouse-cultures should be established wherever it is cost effective . if inhouse-cultures can not be maintained or it is not cost effective , test-organisms or starter-cultures should be purchased from experienced commercial-suppliers ( see usepa , 2002a ) . 6.2.3 starter-cultures of the green-algae , selenastrum-capricornutum , s. minutum , and chlamydomonas-reinhardti are available from commercial-suppliers . 6.2.4 because the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , must be cultured individually in the laboratory for at least seven days before the test begins , it will be necessary to obtain a starter-culture from a commercial-source at least three weeks before the test is to begin if they are not being cultured inhouse . 6.2.5 if , because of their source , there is any uncertainty concerning the identity of the organisms , it is advisable to have them examined by a taxonomic-specialist to confirm their identification . for detailed-guidance on identification , see the individual-test-methods . 6.2.6 feral ( natural occurring , wild caught ) organisms 6.2.6.1 the use of test-organisms taken from the receiving-water has strong-appeal , and would seem to be a logical-approach . however , it is generally-impractical and not recommended for the following-reasons : 1 . sensitive-organisms may not be present in the receiving-water because of previous-exposure to the effluent or other pollutants . 2 . it is often-difficult to collect organisms of the required-age and quality from the receiving-water . 3 . most states require collecting-permits , which may be difficult to obtain . therefore , it is usually more cost effective to culture the organisms in the laboratory or obtain them from private , state , or federal-sources . the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , and the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , are easily-cultured in the laboratory or readily-available commercially . 4 . the required qa/qc records , such as the single-laboratory-precision data , would not be available . 5 . since it is mandatory that the identity of the test-organism be known to species-level , it would be necessary to examine each organism caught in the wild to confirm its identity . this would usually be impractical or , at the least , very stressful to the organisms . 6 . test-organisms obtained from the wild must be observed in the laboratory for a minimum of one week prior to use , to assure that they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial-infections and other adverse-effects . fish captured by electroshocking must not be used in toxicity-testing . 6.2.6.2 guidelines for collecting natural occurring-organisms are provided in usepa ( 1973 ) , usepa ( 1990 ) and usepa ( 1993b ) . 6.2.7 regardless of their source , test-organisms should be carefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stress and disease , and in good physical-condition . some species of test-organisms can be obtained from commercial-stock certified as '' disease-free '' . 6.3 life-stage 6.3.1 young-organisms are often more sensitive to toxicants than are adults . for this reason , the use of early-life-stages , such as larval-fish , is required for all tests . in a given test , all organisms should be approximately the same age and should be taken from the same source . since age may affect the results of the tests , it would enhance the value and comparability of the data if the same species in the same life-stages were used throughout a monitoring-program at a given facility . 6.4 laboratory culturing 6.4.1 instructions for culturing and/or holding the recommended-test-organisms are included in the respective-test-methods ( also , see usepa , 2002a ) . 6.5 holding and handling test-organisms 6.5.1 test-organisms should not be subjected to changes of more than 3°c in water-temperature in any 12 h period or 2 units of ph in any 24-h period . 6.5.2 organisms should be handled as little as possible . when handling is necessary , it should be done as gently , carefully , and quickly as possible to minimize stress . organisms that are dropped or touch a dry-surface or are injured during handling must be discarded . dipnets are best for handling larger organisms . these nets are commercially-available or can be made from small-mesh nylon-netting , silk-batting-cloth , plankton-netting , or similar material . wide-bore , smooth-glass-tubes ( 4 to 8 mm id ) with rubber-bulbs or pipettors ( such as propipette® ) should be used for transferring smaller organisms such as larval-fish . 6.5.3 holding-tanks for fish are supplied with good-quality water ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies ) with flow-through-rate of at least two tank-volumes per day . otherwise-use a recirculation-system where water flows through an activated carbon or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolites . culture-water can also be piped through high intensity-ultraviolet light-sources for disinfection , and to photodegrade dissolved organics . 6.5.4 crowding must be avoided because it will stress the organisms and lower the do concentrations to unacceptable-levels . the solution of oxygen depends on temperature and altitude . the do must be maintained at a minimum of 4.0 mg/l . aerate gently if necessary . 6.5.5 the organisms should be observed carefully each day for signs of disease , stress , physical-damage , or mortality . dead and abnormal-organisms should be removed as soon as observed . it is not uncommon for some fish-mortality ( 5-10 % ) to occur during the first 48 h in a holding-tank because of individuals that refuse to feed on artificial-food and die of starvation . organisms in the holding-tanks should generally be fed as in the cultures ( see culturing methods in the respective-methods ) . 6.5.6 fish should be fed as much as they will eat at least once a day with live brine-shrimp-nauplii , artemia , or frozen-adult brine-shrimp , or dry-food ( frozen-food should be completely thawed before use ) . adult-brine-shrimp can be supplemented with commercially prepared-food such as tetramin® or bioril® flake-food , or equivalent . excess food and fecal-material should be removed from the bottom of the tanks at least twice a week by siphoning . 6.5.7 a daily-record of feeding , behavioral-observations , and mortality should be maintained . 6.6 transportation to the test-site 6.6.1 organisms are transported from the base or supply laboratory to a remote-test-site in culture-water or standard-dilution-water in plastic-bags or large-mouth-screw-cap ( 500 ml ) plastic-bottles in styrofoam-coolers . adequate do is maintained by replacing the air above the water in the bags with oxygen from a compressed gas-cylinder , and sealing the bags or by use of an airstone supplied by a portable-pump . the do concentration must not fall below 4.0 mg/l . 6.6.2 upon arrival at the test-site , the organisms are transferred to receiving-water if receiving-water is to be used as the test-dilution-water . all but a small-volume of the holding-water ( approximately 5 % ) is removed by siphoning and replaced slowly over a 10 to 15-minute-period with dilution-water . if receiving-water is to be used as the dilution-water , caution must be exercised in exposing the test-organisms to it , because of the possibility that it might be toxic . for this reason , it is recommended that only approximately 10 % of the test-organisms be exposed initially to the dilution-water . if this group does not show excessive-mortality or obvious-signs of stress in a few hours , the remainder of the test-organisms may be transferred to the dilution-water . 6.6.3 a group of organisms must not be used for a test if they appear to be unhealthy , discolored , or otherwise stressed , or if mortality appears to exceed 10 % preceding the test . if the organisms fail to meet these criteria , the entire-group must be discarded and a new group obtained . the mortality may be due to the presence of toxicity , if the receiving-water is used as dilution-water , rather than a diseased-condition of the test-organisms . if the acclimation-process is repeated with a new group of test-organisms and excessive-mortality occurs , it is recommended that an alternative-source of dilution-water be used . 6.7 test-organism disposal 6.7.1 when the toxicity-test ( s ) is concluded , all test-organisms ( including-controls ) should be humanely destroyed and disposed of in an appropriate-manner .
