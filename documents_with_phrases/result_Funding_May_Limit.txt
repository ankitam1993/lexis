the salt lake tribune funding may limit legal-aid for victims of domestic-violence ashley broughton friday , october 18 , 2002 low-income domestic-violence-victims may find long-term legal-help -- representation in divorces or child-custody-disputes -- hard to come by , if two organizations now providing such help can't replace their lost-funding . the legal-aid society of salt lake and utah legal-services are already facing-cutbacks after they were refused a federal-grant of more than $ 450,000 in september . the board overseeing the state-office of crime victim reparations [ cvr ] has voted to deny a stopgap-funding-request from the two organizations . while describing the request as a worthy-cause , board members agreed tuesday that funding-divorces or custody-disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct-services for crime-victims . the $ 175,000 requested would have allowed the legal-aid-groups to maintain a skeleton-staff to continue providing-help beyond emergency protective-orders for victims , completing existing-cases and offering-services in limited-cases . the groups also plan to enlist more pro-bono attorneys through coordination with the utah state-bar . `` we do n't have a lot more options , '' said anne milne , executive director of utah legal-services , after learning of the cvr refusal wednesday . the organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases , she said . milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until november to seek funding from additional-sources . without additional-funding , the outlook for longer-term legal-help is unclear . for two years , the groups had received 18-month civil legal-assistance grants from the u.s. department of justice and had used them to provide such assistance . but last month , a third-request was denied . funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective-orders remains in place , said milne and stewart ralphs , executive director of the legal-aid society of salt lake . although an order 's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years , protective-orders only settle issues such as child-custody , child-support , custody and property-arrangements for 150 days . many judges are reluctant to address those issues in emergency protective-orders , since the decrees stay in effect for such a short time , milne and ralphs said . `` the likelihood a victim will return to her abuser-increases if she can not permanently sever the relationship and establish workable-support , custody and property-arrangements , '' the funding-request to cvr said . the department of justice said it denied the grant-application , in part , because evaluators did not see enough-collaboration between the organizations and victims ' advocates , ralphs and milne told cvr board members . while the two said they believe their organizations coordinate well , the organizations can not appeal the grant-denial . although cvr board members considered giving the money as a loan , not a grant , their vote on the funding-request -- taken after milne and ralphs left the meeting -- was unanimous .
