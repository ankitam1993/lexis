introduction as recognized by the president 's national-energy plan ( nep ) , one of the principal-energy-challenges facing us is increasing our energy-supplies in ways that protect and improve the environment . thus , the president directed epa to propose legislation that would significantly reduce so2 , nox , and mercury-emissions from power-generation through a cap-and-trade program . such a program , coupled with appropriate-measures to address local-concerns , would provide significant-health-benefits even as we increase energy-supplies and maintain reasonable-electricity-rates . our work on this issue has given us insight that i believe will be helpful to you . the more i learn about the cost and inefficiencies of the current and future regulatory-regime to which power-generators will be subjected if we do not have new legislation , the more i am convinced that we can -- and must -- develop a smarter-approach that protects the environment and public health while reducing the cost to consumers and industry and optimizing the size of both the state and federal government machinery necessary to achieve that protection . it is possible to achieve better results at lower costs , but not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of the existing-regulations . the current clean-air act has been enormously-successful , but we can do better . significant-cost-savings can be achieved for power-generators and consumers through a comprehensive-legislative package . i look forward to working with you to develop such an approach to reduce emissions from power-generation . we applaud senator jeffords for tackling this important-issue and for recognizing that a cap-and-trade program is the best way to achieve these reductions . however , we have significant-concerns with s. 556 as drafted . our analysis to date suggests that it could increase consumers ' electricity-rates by as much as 50 % , which we believe is unacceptable . in addition , the combination of emission-reductions and timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability of electricity-supply . we are concerned that s. 556 's short-timeframes for installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken off-line at important-times , which could lead to electricity shortages . in addition , there are a number of issues that congress should consider that s. 556 does not address . as drafted , s. 556 would make some existing-requirements unnecessary , but would not eliminate them . rather than add yet another layer of environmental-regulations on top of the existing-ones , we believe that s. 556 should eliminate those unnecessary existing-requirements . s. 556 also does not have an allocation-scheme . one lesson we should learn from the success of the acid-rain-cap and trade-program is that when certain key-issues can be resolved through clear-legislation , we can avoid years of litigation , business-uncertainty and costs , and delayed environmental-protection . finally , and most importantly , the administration strongly opposes including co2 reductions in any multi-pollutant-bill . the co2 provisions in s. 556 will cost consumers too much and endanger our energy-security by causing too much-electricity-generation to switch from coal to natural gas . greenhouse-gas emissions should be addressed in the context of climate-change , which is being undertaken by the president 's cabinet-level working-group . for all of these reasons , the administration must oppose s. 556 . in my testimony-today i will elaborate further on these key-points . background over the last 30 years , we have made substantial-progress towards improved environmental-quality under the clean-air act . during this time , gross domestic product has increased almost 160 % . at the same time , we have reduced emissions of six key-air pollutants by 29 % , while coal-consumption has increased 77 % and energy-consumption has increased 45 % . eleven years ago president george h. w. bush signed into law the most far reaching-amendments to the clean-air act since its enactment in 1970 . included in those amendments was the acid-rain-cap and trade-program , the first program tailored specifically to the utility-sector , which is achieving significant environmental and public-health-benefits at a fraction of the initial-cost-estimates and with relatively-little government-bureaucracy . it is time to revisit and update the clean-air act once again in order to achieve the additional-reductions needed to address public health and environmental-problems in the most cost-effective-manner . the acid-rain-program is achieving its emission-reduction-goal at a fraction of the estimated-costs because it allows and encourages innovative-thinking and long range planning.1 the existing-program establishes a cap on so2 emissions to ensure that the environmental-goal is met , and employs an innovative-market-based-allowance trading-program to achieve the goal at lowest cost . allowances are the currency with which compliance with the so2 emissions-requirements is achieved . sources , rather than government , decide the most cost-effective way to use available-resources to comply . units that reduce their emissions below the number of allowances they hold may trade allowances with other units in the system , sell them to other sources or save them for future-use . there are neither restrictions on trading nor government-second-guessing . allowance-trading provides incentives for energy-conservation and technology-innovation that can both lower the cost of compliance and yield pollution-prevention-benefits . simply , the allowance-market puts a price or value on each ton of so2 not emitted . the association of a monetary-value with reduced emissions encourages innovation : in the 1990 's , scrubber-costs decreased by approximately 40 % and scrubber-sulfur removal-efficiencies improved from 90 % to 95 % , and experimentation led to the blending of fuels to lower emissions . to ensure that the cap is met and to provide credibility , sources also are required to install systems that continuously monitor and report-emissions . the acid-rain-program has proven to be an excellent-model for cap-and-trade programs . compliance with the program has been nearly 100 percent and annual-emissions of so2 from power plants have already been reduced over 6 million tons ( about 35 percent ) from 1980 levels . greater-reductions earlier than expected have lowered risks to human-health and provided-benefits to the environment sooner . acid-rain levels were dramatically reduced over large-areas of the u.s. and trading did not result in geographic shifting of emissions , or `` hot-spots '' , as some feared . despite the significant progress we have made under the clean-air act , air-emissions from power-generators are still contributing to serious public health and environmental-problems . administrator whitman addressed these concerns extensively in her testimony before you on july 26 , 2001 . rather than reiterate her testimony , i will emphasize just a few of her key-points . problems associated with sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) , and mercury-emissions are of national and international-significance , and the interstate and long-range-transport of emissions continue to play significant-roles in the nature and magnitude of the problems . emission and deposition of so2 , nox , and mercury and their transformation-byproducts are known to have a wide-range of adverse-effects on human-health and the environment , including : • so2 and nox-emissions contribute to fine-particles , which are associated with premature-mortality , aggravated chronic-bronchitis , hospitalizations due to cardio-respiratory-symptoms , emergency-room-visits due to aggravated asthma-symptoms , and acute-respiratory symptoms . 1 governor whitman 's july 26 , 2001 , testimony before this committee contains a detailed-discussion of the success of the acid-rain-cap and trade-program . fine-particles formed from power-plant-emissions as well as mobile-source-emissions are of concern . • nox-emissions contribute to ground-level-ozone , which aggravates respiratory-illnesses and causes lung inflammation , particularly for at-risk-populations such as children , the elderly and those afflicted with asthma , emphysema , and other respiratory-ailments . • mercury-emissions contribute to mercury-deposition in water . children born to women who consume large amounts of mercury-contaminated-fish while pregnant may be at risk for neurodevelopmental-defects . • so2 and nox-emissions contribute to atmospheric-sulfate and nitrate-concentrations that cause-visibility-impairment , including impairment in many national-parks and wilderness-areas . • so2 and nox contribute to acid-deposition , which damages lakes and streams , adversely affecting the fish and other species that live in them , and leaches nutrients from the soil . • nox-emissions contribute to nitrogen-deposition that may lead to eutrophication of estuaries and near-coastal-waters and can damage forested-watersheds . epa , states , and industry , working together , have made important strides in addressing the adverse-impacts of fossil-fuel-combustion by the electric-power-industry since the passage of the clean-air act in 1970 . despite significant-improvements in air-quality throughout the country however , emissions from power-generation continue to result in serious-health , environmental and economic-impacts . in 1999 , the electric-power-industry was responsible for 67 % of sulfur-dioxide-emissions , 25 % of nitrogen-oxide-emissions , and 37 % of mercury-emissions in the united states . business as usual the president 's flexible , market-based-approach to reducing-emissions from power-generators stands in sharp-contrast to the complex-web of existing-regulations which currently confront the industry . over the years , congress , epa and the states have responded to specific environmental and public-health-problems by developing separate regulatory-programs to address the specific-problems . each individual-program uses its own approach on its own timeline to serve its own purpose . absent-changes to the act , epa and states will be forced to follow the same approach in future-regulations . it is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve our clean-air-goals . a comprehensive-legislative approach with mandatory-caps could replace a good-portion of the current regulatory-requirements with a system that will reduce the administrative-burden on industry and governments , use market-based-approaches to lower compliance-costs , reduce consumers ' costs , and increase national-energy-security by providing the industry with more certainty about its future regulatory-obligations . by enacting such an approach , we can achieve environmental and public health protection more effectively and at less cost . if we do it the president 's way , it will be a win-win . there are many regulations in place that will reduce air-emissions from electric-power-generation . these regulations include both federal and state requirements that address a variety of emissions including so2 , nox , co , pm10 , and a number of hazardous-air-pollutants . these programs include the national-ambient-air quality-standards for so2 , particulate-matter and ozone , the section 126 and the nox sip-call rules , the acid-rain-program , new source-review , new source-performance-standards , and the regional-haze-rule . but the regulation of power-generators does not end with existing-regulations . epa is obligated by a settlement-agreement to issue by the end of 2004 a maximum achievable-control-technology ( mact ) standard to require source-specific-controls of mercury and other hazardous-air-pollutants from electric-utilities . emissions-reductions are required by the end of 2007 . states will also be requiring-utilities to comply with best-available retrofit-technology ( bart ) programs ( either source-specific-standards or a trading-program ) to meet requirements to reduce regional-haze . it is expected that the existing fine-particle and ozone standards now in place will also result in further regulation of power-generators . modeling shows that when full-implementation of existing-regulations such as the acid-rain-program , the nox sip-call , the tier ii standards for cars and trucks , the heavy-duty diesel-engine-standards , and the low-sulfur-gasoline and diesel fuel-rules are taken into account , additional-reductions will be needed to bring areas into attainment . states will be required to develop plans for these areas . in addition , nox and so2 reductions are also needed to reduce continuing-damage from acid-rain and nitrogen-deposition . because states and epa will have to find some way to significantly reduce nox and so2 emissions , it is probable that power-generators will be required to reduce their emissions significantly . power-generation accounts for a significant-percentage of these emissions , and our analysis shows that there are significant-reductions available at lower cost than from other sources . additionally , states know that if they do not get the reductions from power-generators , they will have to impose significant-reduction-requirements on other local industrial and commercial-sources or impose local-transportation-control measures . under current-law , the necessary-reductions would be achieved through the development of individual-state-plans . states will not just control their own sources , however . they will be reaching out to control power-generators and large industrial-facilities in other states because transport from other states contributes to both ozone and fine-particle-pollution in many areas . this is what has happened in the eastern-part of the country when states realized that emissions from sources in other states were significantly contributing to their 1-hour ozone non-attainment problems . under section 126 of the clean-air act , a state can petition epa and request that epa require reductions from sources outside the petitioning-state 's borders . the petitioning-state is entitled to relief if epa finds that the sources are significantly contributing to the petitioning-state 's nonattainment-problem . epa 's requirement , adopted in response to section 126 petitions , that sources in a number of eastern-states reduce nox-emissions was recently upheld by the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . since states now know that epa has authority to address-transport-pollution through responses to 126 petitions or by issuing a rule like the nox sip-call , we anticipate that states will be turning to these types of control-approaches early in the sip-process . although those of us who are traveling that path with the current 126 petitions and nox sip-call believe it will eventually take us to our environmental-goal , it has been -- and still is -- a very rocky-road for industry , environmentalists , the states , epa and other stakeholders . this one-at-a-time , uncoordinated-series of regulatory-requirements for the power-industry is not the optimal-approach for the environment , the power-generation-sector , or american-consumers . with most plants needing to install control-equipment to meet these requirements , it is likely that this approach would lead to installation of controls that become obsolete and stranded capital-investments as additional-requirements are promulgated . further , the attainment-efforts of individual-states and localities not only impose costs on these entities , but also can increase complexity for companies which face differing-requirements when operations cross state-lines . these factors are exacerbated by limited-timeframes that may constrain available-compliance-options and thwart long range-planning . these and other inefficiencies point to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could reduce cost while improving environmental-progress and accountability . changing the way we do business : certainty , flexibility , accountability and innovation we believe there is a better way , one that could cost american-consumers and industry far less than under current-law and ensure protection of the air we breathe in a far more certain , straightforward-manner . i know that many members of this committee share that belief and are also working to develop such an approach . it would provide power-generators with more certainty about their regulatory-future and thus allow them to make wiser decisions about investments in new technology , which would improve energy-security . this administration is developing such a proposal . it will build on the successes of the acid-rain-cap and trade-program . it would establish national cap-and-trade-programs for nox , so2 and mercury-emissions from power-generators ( with appropriate-measures to address local-concerns ) . such an approach will benefit the power-generation industry , the economy , and the states , while improving public health and the environment . up-front-knowledge of future-requirements for multiple-pollutants would lead firms to follow significantly-different and less expensive-compliance-strategies at individual-plants , compared with compliance-choices which must be made as requirements are addressed in a sequential-manner under the current-law . the savings come from the opportunity to make cost-effective-plant-investment and retirement-decisions with full-knowledge of upcoming so2 , nox and mercury-requirements , rather than investing in `` add-on '' control-equipment to meet the requirements of each regulation . integration , advance-knowledge , and certainty regarding environmental requirements will have even greater value over the coming-decade as the electric-power-industry undergoes further structural-changes . an integrated-package of measures that addresses both the existing regulatory-requirements as well as many future environmental-needs would provide the greatest degree of certainty and flexibility for the industry , while achieving the necessary-emission-reductions at lower cost than under current-law . in exchange for flexibility in methods to control emissions , a full-accounting of emissions through continuous-monitoring and reporting is essential , as well as significant-consequences for failing to comply . such provisions have been critical to the success of the acid-rain-program , encouraging individual-sources to find the most cost-effective-means of compliance with the collective-emission-reduction goal . flexibility stimulates technological-innovation , fuels economic activity and reduces cost to industry and consumers . strategies and technologies for the control of so2 , nox and mercury-emissions exist now , and improved-methods are expected to become available over the next several years . the air-pollution-control and monitoring-technology-industry is expected to continue to respond with cost-effective-compliance-solutions just as they have done for the past 30 years . a predictable-demand for such jobs over the next 15 years is preferable to the boom and bust-cycle created by the current regulatory-approach . this approach also would reduce states ' administrative-burdens and obligations . a national-cap and trade-program with appropriate caps for nox and so2 could provide the emission-reductions necessary to bring a significant number of areas into attainment with the ozone and fine-particle-standards . even those areas that would not be brought into attainment by these caps would need significantly fewer emission-reductions to come into attainment . our approach would significantly reduce the state-resources needed to conduct modeling , planning and regulatory-activities to attain the standards . additionally , the acid-rain-cap and trade-program is administered with a relatively-small staff relying on strong , state-of-the-art-data-tracking and reporting-capabilities . thus , well-designed national-cap and trade-programs can help use government-resources and taxpayer-dollars more efficiently at both the state and federal-level . caps ensure that environmental-goals are met . a cap that represents significant-reductions of emissions protects the environment by reducing overall-loadings . consideration of local-concerns is important in conjunction with trading-provisions . therefore , the national-energy plan recommended that the administration 's approach include appropriate-measures to address local-concerns , such as the unlikely-occurrence of an so2 `` hot spot '' or area of concentrated-emissions . significant-reductions will go a long way towards addressing local-concerns . in addition , epa will be conducting-modeling that will predict where emissions-reductions will occur . under the acid-rain-cap and trade-program , we have not seen local hot-spots because the highest emitters are often the most cost-effective to control and therefore , the most likely to control . as i mentioned , epa and the administration are still in the process of developing our proposal . several-guidelines are shaping our efforts . these guidelines may provide a valuable-basis as you weigh the proposals before you . they will also guide our assessment of other proposals , including s. 556 . these principles are structured to ensure consistency with the nep objectives . the nep goals of increasing-energy-supplies , accelerating the protection and improvement of the environment , and increasing our nation's energy-supply must be advanced . towards that end , energy-diversity , the preservation of electricity-generation and transmission reliability , and improvement of energy 9 efficiency/energy intensity of the electric-power-industry should be a key-consideration . in particular , to prevent the reoccurrence of energy-shortages and price-volatility , a diverse mix of fuel-sources should be maintained . specific-comments on s. 556 we share the desire expressed in s. 556 to significantly reduce and cap-emissions of so2 , nox and mercury from power-generation . we applaud your acknowledgment of market-based-incentives , particularly-cap and trade-systems , as a powerful-tool in environmental-protection . in this way , s. 556 builds on successful elements of the clean-air act . we do , however , oppose s. 556 because of concerns with the bill -- both with some provisions that are in the bill and with some that are missing . we believe the emission-reductions and timing in the bill will be too costly for consumers and will endanger national-energy-security . we believe the bill is missing some provisions -- it should address the allocation-scheme and integration with existing-programs . finally , we oppose inclusion of co2 in this bill . first , let me explain some of our specific-concerns about the so2 , nox , and mercury-provisions in the bill . we are concerned that the significant-emissions-reductions are required too quickly . we do not believe it is reasonable to expect all the control-technology installations to be completed in that time frame without very high costs and electricity-reliability-problems . to meet these deadlines , facilities may need to be taken off-line during critical periods . reliability-problems could arise as large amounts of capacity are taken out of service for extended periods of time to install the control-equipment necessary to meet the emissions-reduction-requirements . the abbreviated-time-frame would force many generators to make these retrofits simultaneously . this would significantly reduce the amount of generating-capacity available to meet consumer ' electrical-needs . we have not modeled the specific-provisions in s. 556 , but useful-information is provided by comparing the analyses epa and eia conducted to respond to a request from senators smith , voinovich and brownback with the analyses responding to a request from senators jeffords and lieberman . in the smith/voinovich/brownback analysis , when we analyzed so2 and nox reduction-levels similar to s. 556 , mercury-reduction levels more modest than s. 556 and no co2 reductions , we did not find significant-impacts on coal-production or electricity-prices . however , in the analysis responding to the jeffords/lieberman request that had nox , so2 , mercury and co2 reduction-levels similar to s. 556 , we found significant-ramifications : approximately a 20-30 % decline of coal-generation and a 30-50 % increase in electricity-prices compared to the reference-case ( depending on assumptions of energy-technology-penetration ) . the 90 % source-specific-control for mercury is also problematic . we have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coal-fired-power-plant would be able to achieve 90 % source-specific-controls for mercury by 2007 , without considerable-fuel-switching , which would be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy-security . in addition , requiring the same level of reduction at a plant that emits 0.1 pounds of mercury and a plant that emits 2000 pounds of mercury - regardless of cost - is neither-efficient nor necessary . we are also very concerned about the `` outdated-power-plant '' provision . requiring every plant over 30 years old to meet new source-performance-standards and new source-review modification requirements seems unnecessary and could undermine the benefits of the cap-and-trade approach . allowing-sources to make reductions where it is most economical to do so is one of the reasons-cap and trade-programs should be less costly than command-and-control-programs that achieve the same or even fewer reductions . when you have a hard-cap , as you would under s. 556 , requiring-emission reductions at a specific-source does not reduce the overall-level of pollution , it just limits industry 's flexibility about where to make the reductions . layering additional-requirements , such as the '' outdated power plants '' provision , on top of a cap-and-trade program is very likely to increase costs without providing significant environmental-benefits . second , we have concerns about what is not in s. 556 . comparing our experience on the acid-rain-program with the nox sip-call and the section 126 petitions demonstrates the benefit of having certain key-issues decided by congress rather than left to agency rulemakings . congressional-resolution of key-issues simplifies whatever agency rulemaking is needed and decreases the opportunities for the program to get tied up in protracted litigation . perhaps the most important-program-element not addressed in the bill is integration of this new program with the existing clean-air act-provisions . an effective market-based-approach would make some existing-provisions of the clean-air act unnecessary . for example , depending on the ultimate-cap-levels chosen by congress , this type of legislation would obviate the need for best-available retrofit-technology requirements , mercury mact , and new source-review case-by-case-technology-requirements for power-generators . also missing from s. 556 is the scheme for allocating-allowances . developing an allocation-scheme requires answering numerous-questions . should the allowances be auctioned off or be handed out for free ? if they are not auctioned , should they be allocated based on heat-input or electrical and steam-output ? should power-generators that do not emit air-pollutants ( e.g. , hydropower-facilities ) be given allowances ? should allowance-allocations be updated , and if so , how frequently ? should allocations be fuel neutral ? imbedded in these and other questions are important environmental and energy-policy-choices with significant-equity-consequences . it may not be efficient for epa to make these choices in rulemaking . there are other issues as well that this committee should consider , such as coordination with existing-state and regional-programs like the western regional air partnership and the nox reduction-programs in the east . the committee may also wish to consider provisions to track environmental-progress to evaluate the efficacy of the program this bill would establish . finally , the administration strongly opposes including reductions for co2 in s. 556 or any multi-pollutant-bill . pursuing sharp-reductions in co2 from the electricity generating-sector alone would cause a dramatic-shift from coal to natural gas and thus would run the risk of endangering national-energy-security , substantially increasing-energy-prices and harming-consumers . the administration will not support any legislation that would cause a significant-decline in our nation 's ability to use coal as a major-source of current and future-electricity . at the same time , the administration will not support any legislation that does not enhance the cleanliness of coal-fired-electricity-generation and promote a future for clean-coal-technologies . in short , the administration supports a clean-coal-policy as a critical-component of our nation 's energy and environmental-policies , recognizing that other sources of energy also have a critical-role to play . additionally , as governor whitman said when she testified before you in july , including co2 in this bill will slow down , if not prevent , the consensus necessary for passage of legislation to control multiple-emissions from power plants . governor whitman and i both believe consensus on the appropriate-levels and timing for reductions of nox , so2 and mercury is achievable relatively soon . we should not delay the public health and environmental-benefits from reduction of these emissions while we wait for consensus to develop on co2 . we agree that climate-change is a serious-issue we need to address . however , co2 has never been regulated as a pollutant under the clean-air act and does not pose any direct-threat to human-health unlike nox , so2 and mercury . the current-body of scientific knowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric concentrations of co2 or reduction-levels necessary to prevent dangerous-interference with the climate-system . in april , the president convened a cabinet-level-policy-review of this issue and was provided with initial-recommendations that he accepted and announced on june 11 . in that regard , the administration is implementing two major-initiatives on climate-science and advanced-energy and sequestration-technologies . the united states now spends $ 1.6 billion annually on climate-science to reduce uncertainties - a commitment unmatched by any other nation . the `` national climate-change technology initiative '' will accelerate priority-research and the application of advanced-energy and sequestration-technologies , recognizing that the real-answer to addressing-climate-change in the long term lies in the development and global-introduction of such technologies in this century . and the cabinet-level-policy-review is ongoing . finally , as greenhouse-gas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developing-world in the next two decades , we must evaluate the costs of imposing domestic-reductions as a very high cost against potentially low-cost-opportunities for mitigating and sequestering carbon emissions in the developing-world . we appreciate the role of s. 556 in generating important discussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach to controlling-emissions in the power-sector . i look forward to the additional-hearings you will need to address these important-issues and to working with the committee to develop an approach that the president can support . the history of clean-air act legislation is one of great accomplishments made possible by bipartisan-efforts . i thank you for the opportunity to work with you to continue that great tradition .
