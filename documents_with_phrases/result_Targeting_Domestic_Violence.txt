targeting domestic-violence-center to help victims john laidler , globe correspondent salem - it 's a traumatic-prospect for any domestic-violence-victim : having to do battle with her batterer in court . but the ordeal is even more difficult for victims who ca n't afford a lawyer . soon a new resource will be available in essex county to expand legal-help to victims who find themselves in that predicament . set to open jan. 22 , the essex county family legal-aid center will provide free legal-assistance to low-income domestic-violence-victims in civil-court . the center will be close to the essex probate and family-court , where many matters involving domestic-violence-victims , from restraining-order-applications to child-custody-disputes , are heard . advocates for domestic-violence-victims say the new center , funded with a $ 303,000 federal-grant , will be an important-step toward getting-people the legal-help they need . `` we 're thrilled , '' said ross dolloff , executive director of neighborhood legal-services , a lynn-based-agency that will run the office in collaboration with lowell-based merrimack valley legal-services . the two agencies provide free legal-representation to low-income-people , including domestic-violence-victims , in civil-matters . but dolloff said there is a `` huge need '' for the services , and the new center will `` get us much further along in terms of our ability to serve that need . '' the grant will pay the salaries of two lawyers and an intake specialist for 18 months at the center , which will operate out of rented space in salem 's old masonic-building at 70 washington st. center organizers hope to obtain more funds to extend the program . in addition to expanding the amount of legal-help available , the center , because of its location near the probate-court , will allow for that help to be more readily-accessible . merrimack valley legal-services , which has an office in lawrence , is convenient for people with cases in the essex county probate-court division in that city . and both merrimack and neighborhood are near district-courts . but neither has an office in salem . `` salem . . . is really developing into the chief probate-court for the county , so it 's very , very critical that we have a presence there , '' said kenneth maciver , director of merrimack valley legal-services . `` it 's just going to serve our clients a whole lot better . '' dolloff said that because the center will be just up the street from the court , it will be easy for probate-court staff to refer people to it . the center is also designed to improve coordination among the two legal-service-groups and agencies in the region that provide counseling and other non-legal-services to victims of domestic-violence . six of those agencies teamed up with the two legal-service-groups to apply for the grant : help for abused-women and their children , based in salem ; the women 's resource-center in lawrence ; the newburyport crisis center ; action inc. , in gloucester ; alternative house , based in lowell ; and north shore community-action program , based in peabody . the money was awarded through the us justice department 's violence against women office . `` it really brings together for the first time all the people who do work for victims of domestic-violence in a single-project . so it 's quite-exciting , '' maciver said . dolloff said the two attorneys-staffing the center , patricia a. levesh and vita palazzolo , will work closely with the domestic-violence service-organizations . he said that would allow for easier referral from those agencies of victims needing legal-help , but also referral by the center of clients who need counseling and other support-services . `` it 's going to be hugely-beneficial for our clients , '' said candace-waldron , executive director of help for abused-women and their children . waldron said hawc advocates help domestic-violence-victims file restraining-orders in district-court . but she said any complicated-issues relating to divorce , child-custody , and child-support are typically heard in probate-court , and for those matters , `` we really need legal-representation for our clients . that 's what this center is going to provide . '' having a lawyer can often be the difference between a woman staying in a violent-relationship and being able to break out of one , waldron said . `` batterers use the courts as a way to maintain control , '' she said . `` one of the ways is they make threats like , 'do n't divorce me . i can get everything , including the kids . ' that 's one of the main-reasons-women do n't want to leave . without a lawyer facing the batterer in the context of the courtroom . . . it can be intimidating . a lot of women do n't even want to start the process because they feel already defeated . '' levesh and palazzolo both bring experience in representing domestic-violence-victims . each lives in gloucester . a graduate of new england school of law , levesh , 47 , has been a staff-attorney for legal-service-organizations for 16 years . for the past five years she has worked for greater boston legal-services , based in boston . before that , she worked for cambridge and somerville legal-services , based in cambridge , and for southeastern massachusetts legal servces in new bedford . palazzolo , 29 , is a graduate of boston college law-school . she has worked as an attorney for the merrimack valley legal-services-office for the past two years . levesh and palazzolo , who serve on a statewide family-law task-force , both say they look forward to working at the new center . `` it 's an opportunity to do the kind of work i 'm doing now - which is advocating for victims of domestic-violence - in my own backyard , '' levesh , who served for a time on hawc 's board , said . `` it 's really-exciting to me to be able to work with these people who are so committed to this work . '' said palazzolo , `` one of the things that excites me about it is starting up a new office and making our legal-services more accessible to people in the north shore area . . . . being in salemwill be a big plus for a lot of our clients .
