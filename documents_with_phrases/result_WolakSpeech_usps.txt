changes in the household-level-demand for postal-delivery-services from 1986 to 1994 frank a. wolak department of economics , stanford university motivation-over the past decade there has been an dramatic-increase in 1 ) available-modes of interpersonal-communication and the range in quality of these modes of communication in terms speed , reliability , and flexibility 2 ) reductions in the price of these modes of communication-long-distance-telephone-service , fax machines , on-line information services compuserve and america online ( zero price for incremental-messages ) many of these modes of communication are very attractive alternatives to traditional postal-delivery-services supplied by the united states postal-service ( usps ) . particularly-true for household-sector-e-mail , electronic-bill paying , fax , long-distance-call total-pieces delivered and mail-revenues have continued to increase percentages by volume in 1996 : first-class -- 53 % , standard mail a ( formerly third-class ) -- 39 % , periodicals -- 6 % , all others -- 2 % . standard mail a-primarily advertising-circulars and mail-order catalogues-comprises an increasing-share of pieces delivered 37.5 % of pieces delivered 1992 versus 39 % of pieces delivered in 1996 from 1993 to 1994 , single-piece-first-class-volume fell by 0.2 percent , but a 6.8 percent-increase in pre-sorted first-class-volume resulted in a net 2.4 percent-increase in first-class-volume . from 1994 to 1995 , single-piece fell by 1.0 percent and from 1995-1996 it fell by 1.5 % . this event appears to signal a leveling-off or decline in household-level-use of usps postal-delivery-services purpose of talk reconcile growth in aggregate-pieces delivered and mail-revenues with increasing relative-price of postal-delivery-services and growing number of substitutes at household-level are household-sector-trends consistent with aggregate trends ? quantify decline in aggregate-household sector postage-consumption . determine the relative-extent to which the decline in household-sector consumption over time can be attributed to 1 ) increasing-penetration of alternative-modes of communication 2 ) increasing relative-price of usps postal-delivery-services specific-questions addressed 1 ) what has happened to the average-household-level-consumption and aggregate ( us population ) household-consumption of postal-delivery-services over the past decade ? 2 ) what are own-price , cross-price and expenditure-elasticities of the household-level-demand for postal-delivery-services and how have they changed over time ? 3 ) what is the impact of home-computing-technology on postal-demand ? 4 ) what household-characteristics predict differences in household-level postal-demand ? aggregate-household-consumption of postal-delivery-services bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) consumer expenditure survey ( ces ) . a national-probability-sample of households . sampling-frame generated from the 1980 census 100-percent detail file . two surveys administered to different-samples of households : ( 1 ) quarterly interview survey and ( 2 ) diary survey diary survey-each selected-household is requested to keep two one-week-diaries of all expenditures over consecutive-weeks . source for householdlevel-postage-expenditures and other non-durable-goods expenditures . interview survey-household is interviewed every three months over a 15month-period . questions about durables-holdings -- cars , housing , and personal-computers . both surveys collect information on household characteristics-hours of work of the head and spouse , occupation of head and spouse , age and race of head and spouse , marital-status , number of children , dwelling-type , income , and census-region of residence . for each household in diary survey from 1986 to 1994 , bls computes a sampling-weight giving the representativeness of that household in the population of us households during the year it is sampled 1 ) how many us households represented by a household with these demographic-characteristics using these weights and bls-recommended-procedure , can compute estimate of us population aggregate-expenditures on postal-delivery-services or aggregate-expenditures any other category of goods *preliminary figures . nominal-declines aggregate-household postage-expenditures . in constant-dollars , decline would be steeper due to real-postage-price increases decline from $ 74.26 per household in 1989 to $ 54.35 in 1994 almost double nominal-increase in aggregate-household-telephones services-expenditures from 1986 to 1994 . increase from $ 421.67 per household in 1986 to $ 690.65 in 1994 shift away from consumption of postal-delivery-services to telephone-services for household-sector from 1987 to 1994 share of usps mail-revenues from us household fell from a little less than 20 percent to a little more than 10 percent significant-shift way from consumption of postal-delivery-services for household-sector relative us economy at large second research-question : what are the sources of these shifts in the consumption of postal-delivery-services ? digression on economic model of household-behavior each household is assumed to have a demand-function for each good which depends on the prices of all goods , the household's budgeted-total-expenditure and observable and unobservable-characteristics of the household let p , p , ... , p be the prices for goods-household-purchases , m be the 12 k household 's budgeted-total-expenditure and a , a , ... , a are the attributes 12 n ( observable and unobservable-characteristics ) of the household . define the household 's demand-function for the ith ( i=1 , ... , k ) good x * = d ( p , p , ... , p , m , a , a , ... , a ) i i12k 12 n the amount each good , x , the household consumes . there are k goods and i n characteristics . one household-characteristic we focus on is an indicator variable of whether or not the household owns a personal-computer . this is our measure of the potential for electronic substitution . this will allow us to determine extent to which decline is household-level-demand is due to 1 ) increasing relative-price of postage 2 ) increasing-penetration of personal-computing-technology using econometric-modeling-techniques applied to our sample of households , we are able recover an estimate of the demand-function x * = d ( p , p , ... , p , m , a , a , ... , a ) i i12k 12 n for each household in the sample . demand-functions differ across household depending on observable and unobservable-characteristics of the household using our econometric-model , we can compute an estimate of any us household 's demand for postal-delivery-services given its m and a , a , ... , a 12 n quantifying-demand-responses at household-level price-elasticity of demand = one percent-increase in the price of the ith good , p , brings about what percentage-change in the household 's demand for i good j , dj if i = j , then it is the own-price-elasticity of demand , otherwise-magnitude is called the cross-price-elasticity of demand . elasticity-concept can be extended to any other variable in household's demand-function expenditure elasticity of demand = one percent-increase in the household 's total-expenditure , m , brings about what percentage-change in household-level-demand for good j , dj for each us household can compute an estimate of its own-price and crossprice-elasticities of demand and the expenditure elasticity of demand . one of observable-attributes that is assumed to shift the household 's demand for postage is whether or not is owns a personal-computer . model yields an estimate of the percentage-change in a household 's demand for postage as a result of owning a computer aggregate-demand-function for the household-sector using bls weights , can compute an estimate of the aggregate us population-demand-function for postage from the household-sector as the weighted-sum of sample-household level-demand-functions can compute-own-price and cross-price-elasticities of aggregate-household-demand for postage using this aggregate-demand-function . estimated aggregate u.s. household postage demand-elasticity estimates these magnitudes give the percent-change in the demand from the household-sector as result of a one percent-change in any price , household 's total-expenditure or fraction of us households owning a personal-computer . substantial-increase in absolute-value of own-price-elasticity of aggregate-household-demand from 1986 to 1994 , from -0.76 to -1.27 . decline in total-expenditure ( income ) elasticity of demand from 0.36 to 0.25 over same period . increasing-degree of substitutability between postal-delivery-services and telephone-services over past decade , from -0.12 in 1986 ( complements ) to 0.11 ( substitutes ) in 1994 increased penetration of personal-computing-technology at household-level initially predicts increased demand for postal-delivery-services . by 1994 , predicts reduction in demand for postal-delivery-services , holding all other factors constant . estimated aggregate-revenue-losses based on 1994 elasticity estimates in general , an x % own-price-increase in a product with an own-price-elasticity of , increases revenues by x ( 1 + , ) % . if , is less than one in absolute-value revenues increase . if it is greater than one revenues fall . in 1994 , , = -1.27 . note that before 1989 , , is less than one in absolute-value , so that aggregate-household-revenues increase with price increases . consider january 1 , 1995-price-increase for a one ounce first-class-letter from $ 0.29 to 0.32 , a little more than a 10 % increase . from estimated annual household postage-expenditures in 1994 are approximately $ 5 billion , which implies a 2.7 percent-reduction in annual aggregate-expenditures or approximately a $ 135 million reduction in annual-revenues from household-sales , holding all else constant . impact of on household-level-demand a 17-percent-increase in penetration of computer-ownership for all households . in 1994 , fraction of households owning a personal-computer is 0.25 . a 17-percent-increase in this number is 1.17 ( 0.25 ) = 0.29 , a plausible-increase in the penetration of computer-ownership by households over the course of a single-year . from estimate in above table us aggregate-elasticity of demand with respect to computer-ownership is -0.16 . therefore , 17 % increase in purchase-probability brings about a 0.16 ( 17 ) = 2.7 percent-reduction in aggregate-demand . assuming no postal-price-change , this implies a 2.7 percent-reduction in revenues from sales to household , or $ 135 million reduction in revenues , same as a 10 percent price-increase . caveats there is uncertainty associated with all of the numbers presented in this paper due to sampling-error and estimation-error in econometric-estimation-procedure used to recover household-level-demand functions less confidence in exact-magnitudes reported , more confidence in trends they illustrate 1 ) decline in revenue-share from household-sector 2 ) increasing , in absolute-value , own-price-elasticity 3 ) increasing-substitutability away from postage-consumption with computer-use 4 ) increasing-substitutability between postage and telephone-consumption . economic and econometric-theory
