do-it-yourself divorce in vermont state-mandated-course enables nearly 70 percent of divorcing couples to untie the knot without a lawyer . tuesday , january 21 , 2003 montpelier , vt. - a majority of vermonters who divorce do so without hiring an attorney . instead , they take a class on how to represent themselves . the court-mandated-session is for people who have filed for divorce and opted not to hire a lawyer . nearly 70 percent of vermonters are divorced without an attorney , according to statistics from the court administrator 's office . some are put off by the cost of a hiring a divorce-lawyer , which starts at about $ 1,500 . others just want to be in control of the process . `` there 's not a lot of low-cost-counsel available . if you 've got limited-resources and you think you can do it , and the court does help , then maybe this is the one thing that you forego in order to pay for something else , '' said sally fox , a former-state representative who helped write the legislation to establish family-courts and who used to be the state-director of family-court operations . there are also risks to going it alone . many of the decisions that are made in front of a judge can not be reversed later . the state established a family-court system in 1990 . a separate court-system would bring divorce and child-custody-cases onto the same docket as juvenile-cases . the goal was to more quickly resolve cases that had to do with children , fox said . `` because it 's a place where the needs of children will be paramount , we want it to be a place where you can get these cases resolved quickly , '' fox said . family-court was set up as a user-friendly-place and continues to add programs to streamline the process . although the court was n't necessarily established to allow the majority of vermonters to represent themselves in a divorce , that has been the effect . tom garrett , executive director of legal-services law line of vermont , said he worries most about people who have reading problems , disabilities or who are so traumatized by the divorce itself that they lack judgment in making-decisions . those people could benefit from a lawyer if they can afford one , he said . `` if people are relatively-sophisticated , relatively-literate and have cool-judgment so they can express themselves well and listen well , they can probably handle this themselves , '' he said .
