making a case -- your own -- in court by jared cook 07/14/2002 yes , lawyers are expensive . but help is now here for those few brave-souls determined to go to court alone . five flagstaff-community-members received valuable-tips and general-advice from two legal-professionals thursday evening at dna-people 's legal-services ' monthly-seminar on how to represent yourself in court . the seminar is held the second thursday each month from 6 to 8 p.m. , usually in the county board of supervisors meeting-room at 219 cherry st . the meetings feature a panel consisting of a professional-attorney and a judge . attendee robert gooch was there for the second time , working to prepare for his upcoming-court-date regarding-car-damages . `` it 's really a great-service , '' he said . `` i think the constitution was written up so you could represent yourself . '' thursday 's judge , the honorable charles adams of the coconino county superior court , agreed , but highly discouraged self-representation . he spent the first 15 minutes of the seminar making certain that all present understood how hard it was to do well . `` it is extremely-difficult to represent yourself , '' he said . `` if you do , you have a fool for a client . '' but with that said , he and fellow-panelist elaine fridlund-horne , a family-law-attorney in solo-practice in flagstaff , began to tell attendees how to do it , focusing first on careful-planning . `` prior planning prevents poor performance , '' said adams , citing what he called the `` five p 's . '' and poor performance is n't afforded much-leniency . according to adams , arizona law says that those representing themselves are held to the same standards as an attorney with respect to knowledge of both the law and legal-procedures . fridlund-horne suggested starting by researching the specific legal-issue at stake at a law-library . dna-people 's legal-services makes one available to the public at its office at 222 e. birch avenue . the librarians there can offer limited-assistance in finding the needed-information . once a person has a general-idea what area of the law is at issue , he or she should consult with an attorney , taking advantage of the free-consultations that many offer . fridlund-horne suggested starting with the yellow pages to find the right-attorney . but , like a mechanic , she said , `` the best way to find an attorney would be by word of mouth . '' the attorney can give basic-advice about what will need to be done to file a lawsuit , or to defend against one . but after that , you 're on your own . library research and consultation , however , are only part of your preparation . an understanding of courtroom-procedure is vital before you try to represent yourself . fridlund-horne recommended that a layperson attend several-trials , especially in the courtroom of the judge who will hear their case , to gain familiarity with the courtroom-atmosphere and procedure . the court-system is open to observers , with very few exceptions , and such an opportunity ought not be missed . adams warned against taking-courtroom-television as an accurate depiction of a real-courtroom . `` do not use judge judy as a role-model -- except for how not to do it , '' he said . in a real-courtroom , he and fridlund-horne agreed , a person's entire-demeanor is a part of the evidence that the judge sees . the way a witness presents himself affects the credibility of his testimony . `` your credibility begins when you open your mouth , '' she said . `` you should be very respectful . '' that respect , she said , need not be for the judge personally . but his office deserves and demands it . adams suggested a simple-rule for behavior while representing yourself : `` mean what you say , say what you mean , and do n't do it in a mean way , '' he said . and , of course , he said , demonstrate the facts with cold , hard-evidence . `` what the judge really wants are the facts -- he wants to make a good-decision , '' he said . proper-organization and presentation of those facts , then , is essential to representing yourself successfully . adams recommended focusing on the basics : who , what , where , when and how . these should be the core of someone 's opening and closing-statements . for the actual-presentation of the facts , adams suggested simple storytelling , his method of choice as an attorney communicating the facts of a case to a jury and judge . `` you 're trying to create a painting , using-words , '' he said . `` that is the art of advocacy . '' the story , however , must be backed with evidence . bearing in mind , then , that the stories told in court will almost certainly diverge from one another , the panel emphasized that a person should do whatever possible to obtain objective-evidence to confirm his or her story . that evidence can include corroborative-witnesses -- and even a layperson representing himself has the power of subpoena to require testimony . fridlund-horne cautioned particularly against trying too hard to disprove the opposition , instead of presenting positive-evidence to prove one 's own case . `` focus on proving your side , '' she said . but above all , she said , show respect to the judge , to the opposition and to the witnesses , in dress , in speech and in general bearing . judges certainly appreciate it . and often , according to adams , they will return the favor . `` i admire you for trying to do this on your own , '' he said . `` you have the right -- and i think judges-respect that . '' for smaller cases , the judge suggested trying-alternative dispute-resolution , a service offered by the coconino county superior court and most courts . it may consist of working with a mediator , judge-conducted-settlement-conferences , arbitration , private-mediators or other methods . it 's a service to help you stay out of the courtroom , he said . you can request it after filing your complaint , but , as with anything filed with a court , nothing can be done about your request until the other party responds .
