sweden is the only industrial-nation which actually has had competition in its letter-mail-market after abolishing its monopoly.2 a competitor , city mail , has served selected portions of the country but was twice forced into bankruptcy.3 city mail has again emerged from bankruptcy and is competing with sweden post . perhaps on city mail 's third-attempt , we will finally have a valid-test of whether sweden post actually needs monopoly-protection in order to provide universal-service at reasonable-prices . as far as the authors know , the economics of the competition between sweden post and its competitor has not been studied . if city mail finally succeeds in avoiding-bankruptcy , such a study might determine the reasons why sweden post was vulnerable to cream-skimming . in addition , it might describe the impact that a viable-competitor has had on 1 in the u.s. , as in most industrial-nations , the postal-monopoly extends only to letter-mail ( including addressed advertising ) . 2 finland has abolished its monopoly and in so doing created a licensing-system for competitors to finland post . no other operator has yet begun to offer service in competition with finland post . new zealand has also just recently abolished its monopoly , but it is too early to know if competitors will emerge and be successful . 3 a recent-study found that the swedish postal-service had engaged in a variety of anti-competitive-practices with respect to its competitor . see `` deregulation of the postal-service 's market ; report on the abuse by the postal office of its dominant-market position and on the competition authority 's handling of the question of competition in relation to the post-office , '' professor erik nerep ( stockholm school of economics ) , february 1995. the dominant-provider . it should be noted that the presence of city mail has already prompted sweden post to lower prices for large-volume-mailers in areas served by its competitor.4 cream-skimmers take advantage of an incumbent 's price when it is based on an average of heterogeneous-costs . they serve the low-cost portion of the market and price below the incumbent . conceptually cream-skimming has two basic-dimensions - product and geography . product cream-skimming is where a competitor tries to capture the most profitable-portion of the market for a product with heterogeneous-costs . geographic-cream-skimming is where a competitor tries to provide a service only to selected , low-cost areas.5 city mail is an example of geographic-cream-skimming . its carriers provide twice weekly-delivery to various-areas in sweden for large-volume customers.6 this paper addresses only geographic-cream-skimming . 7 postal-monopolies , like most other legal-monopolies , are thought by many observers ( 1 ) to be technically-inefficient , and ( 2 ) to have delivery-functions which exhibit-economies of scale.8 this paper addresses several-questions which arise from these two points under the assumption that the monopoly and any other barriers to entry were to be removed . it asks how much more efficient would a potential-competitor have to be to overcome the scale-economies of the u.s . postal-service ? assuming potential-competitors are able to achieve the necessary-level of efficiency , it then asks how much-volume might they be able to capture and in which markets ? finally , it asks what effect 4 it would be interesting to learn : how much it cost sweden post to serve the areas where it lowered-prices relative to its average-cost , how important the abandonment of universal-pricing is to sweden post 's competitive-position , and are the circumstances in sweden applicable to the u.s. ? section j of this paper examines this issue further . 5 cream-skimming may have a third-dimension having to do with transactions-costs . in practice-cream-skimmers may restrict themselves to large-volume-customers since the transaction-costs of dealing with smaller volume-customers and individuals may be prohibitive . 6 sweden post delivers five days per week . 7 a report by the general-accounting-office ( gao ) at least partially analyzed the effect product cream-skimming would have on the u.s . postal-service . its assessment was as follows : priority mail ( first class over 11 ounces ) - high risk of loss of significant-volumes , but a low financial-impact , if it did occur ; first class - low-risk of loss of significant-volumes , but a high financial-impact , if it did occur ; advertising-mail low-risk of loss and a medium financial-impact , if it did occur . see `` postal-service reform ; issues relevant to changing-restrictions on private letter-delivery , '' general-accounting-office , september 1996 . 8 in the u.s. , legal-monopolies include the local-delivery of electricity , gas , water and until recently-telephone . would the loss of volume to cream-skimmers have on the resulting prices the postal-service would have to charge in order to maintain universal-service ? many observers believe that cream-skimmers in the united states would serve cities and leave rural areas to the universal-service-provider because they assume that the cost of delivery to rural areas is much higher than the cost of delivery to cities . an earlier study9 challenged that assumption . it estimated that in 1989 city-delivery-cost per piece was only 8 percent lower than rural-delivery , but that city-delivery-cost per delivery-point was actually 7 percent higher than rural-delivery-cost . it concluded that there was no cross-subsidy of rural-delivery by city-delivery . in theory , cream-skimming of residential-service could occur in either city or rural areas . this paper focuses on city-delivery because of the more detailed-data available on this type of delivery . we first provide a brief-description of the current-competition in delivery . we then describe the data used in our analysis and the costs and profitability of the postal-service 's city residential-delivery-routes . we next examine the volume vulnerable to capture by potential-cream-skimmers . we describe characteristics of routes most likely to be profitable to competitors and provide a range of estimates for the cost of cream-skimmers . after examining the consequences of successful-cream-skimming on postal-service rates , we explain why cream-skimming is not likely to be successful on business-routes in the u.s . finally , we provide some observations on the relevance this analysis may have for other countries . b . current-competition in delivery competitors of the u.s . postal-service may legally deliver only periodicals , catalogues over 24 pages , parcels , and unaddressed letters.10 alternative-delivery is particularly-difficult because of the so called mail-box-law which prohibits any one but the 9 see cohen , ferguson & xenakis , `` rural-delivery and the universal-service-obligation : a quantitative-investigation . '' regulation and the nature of postal-delivery-services , ed . crew & kleindorfer , kluwer academic-publishers , 1993 . technically , the u.s. monopoly is primarily a revenue-monopoly . a third party may deliver a letter if proper-postage is affixed and canceled . the monopoly also has an urgent-mail-exception for letters which are charged twice-normal first-class-postage with a minimum of $ 3.00 . unlike most industrial-nations , there is no exemption from the monopoly based on weight or price . postal-service from accessing a private mail box.11 the u.s . postal-service broadly interprets `` letter '' to include any addressed information recorded on a physical-object . thus , for example , it considers an addressed grocery-store-advertisement to be a letter . in 1989 , publishers express was founded by time inc. , meredith corp. , american express publishing , new york times co. , times mirror co. , and r. r. donnelley , among others , to provide alternative delivery.12 in spite of its prestigious-sponsorship , the company ceased-operations in 1996 . many other small entrepreneurs provide alternative-delivery , but they have a very small-share of the market . they are scattered around the country and mostly deliver unaddressed `` saturation '' advertisements and small-quantities of periodicals and small-parcels . the real alternative-delivery-system in the united states is the newspaper-industry which delivers advertising-preprints or inserts.13 the postal-service has the advantage of being able to deliver these advertisements to all addresses , while newspapers usually ( but not always ) deliver inserts just to their subscribers . a typical-newspaper in the u.s. has less than 50-percent-coverage in its service-area . this puts it at a disadvantage vis a vis the postal-service , which delivers to all households . newspapers , on the other hand , have the advantage of charging lower prices . because marginal-costs are very low , a newspaper-price for preprints might be as low as 5 or 6 cents per piece . the lowest rate currently charged by the postal-service is 11.0 to 11.4 cents for saturation-mail weighing up to 3.3 ounces and drop shipped at the delivery office.14 newspapers deliver about 86 billion inserts annually,15 while the u.s . postal-service delivers at least 11 billion competing items.16 11 as far as we know , the u.s. is the only country that has a mail-box rule . 12 for a more comprehensive-discussion of alternative-delivery in the united states , see the general-accounting-office study , n. 7 , supra . 13 newspapers also deliver product-samples . 14 the postal-service has an additional-disadvantage because city-carriers deliver only addressed advertising-mail . this requires the mailer to have an address-list kept in delivery-sequence and to have address-labels for each piece . 15 newspaper association of america 's web site ; www.naa.org/marketscope/databank/preppriyr.htm . 16 this was the saturation and 125-piece walk sequence enhanced carrier-route-mail volume in 1996 . many of these items are so called `` marriage-mail '' pieces which contain several-individual advertisements combined into a single-piece . these individual advertisements could each be a stand-alone-insert . thus , 11 billion pieces is an extreme lower bound on the number of preprints carried by the postal-service . c. city-carrier data each year the postal-service conducts a city-carrier survey ( ccs ) of delivered mail-volume by route . between 1993 and 1996 , the postal-service conducted the survey using a relatively-small panel of about 400 routes.17 prior to that , the postal-service randomly sampled a much larger cross-section of its routes over the course of a year . the last-set of cross sectional-data filed with the postal-rate commission in 1989 consisted of a sample of 16,092 different routes.18 because of the large-sample-size , these data are far more useful for our analysis than the subsequent-panel data.19 each record in the 1989 ccs contains the date of the observation , the 5-digit zip code in which the route is located , the route type,20 the number of pieces ( by subclass and by shape ) per stop , the number of possible-deliveries and actual-deliveries per stop , and the stop-type ( `` single-delivery residential , '' '' multi-delivery residential , '' and `` business-and-mixed '' ) . generally , data are recorded for every tenth-stop on a route . the authors were able to make use of the records for 14,884 routes.21 this analysis is based on the data-set of 13,212 usable residential-routes22 and 476,953 stops . 23 about 89 percent of all city-routes are residential-routes . the rest are business or mixed ( residential and business ) . d. postal-service delivery-cost and profitability this analysis uses delivery-data from 1989 , but uses 1996 cost levels for wages , fringe-benefits , and other associated-delivery costs . total-volume grew 13.5 percent 17 a panel-survey collects data repeatedly from the same sample . 18 there were 157 thousand city-delivery-routes in fy 1989 . there were also 46 thousand rural-routes , most of which had costs comparable to city-delivery-routes . see cohen , ferguson & xenakis , n. 9 , supra . 19 the 1997 ccs data were not available when the analysis for this paper was conducted . 20 business-foot , business motorized , residential-foot , residential park and loop , residential-curb , mixed-foot , mixed-park and loop , and mixed-curb . 21 the data are organized by the 26-pay-periods in a year . portions of the data from a few pay-periods were not usable . comparisons with previously published summaries indicate that the missing-data did not bias our results . 22 to a much lesser extent this analysis makes use of data from 717 business-routes . 23 ninety-four-percent ( 94 % ) of these stops are residential , while six percent ( 6 % ) are either business , or mixed business-and-residential-stops . not all stops on a residential-route are residences . some are business-stops and some are mixed ( business and residential ) . between 1989 and 1996 , and the number of routes increased 7 percent . we make no attempt to adjust for these increases . when calculating city-delivery-cost , we include the entire ( fixed and volume-variable ) in-office and out-of-office cost24 for all city-routes , plus the cost of overtime , supervision , space , and vehicles . starting with a productive hourly-rate of $ 25.25 for city-carriers , we calculate a cost per residential-delivery-route of $ 266 per delivery day.25 the cost we calculate can be considered to be the avoided cost or the incremental-cost of the city-delivery function . alternatively , it can be considered a lower bound on the stand-alone-cost of city delivery.26 we calculate the daily-profit of residential-delivery-routes for the postal-service by totaling the revenue minus collection , processing and transportation-costs of the mail delivered on each route and subtracting the delivery-cost of $ 266 . table 1 displays a variety of mean-route-statistics for residential-routes separated into quartiles based on their profit . less as can be seen , the mean daily-profit of each quartile-ranges from positive $ 248 to negative $ 110 . the average-profit for all residential-routes is $ 41 with 46.5 percent of the routes operating at a loss . the route-cost per piece-ranges from 7.6 cents to 23.5 cents , and averages 12.5 cents . route-volume ranges from 3,485 pieces to 1,131 pieces , and averages 2,128 pieces . the number of possible-deliveries ( which ranges from 670 to 411 ) is dependent on route-terrain . 27 all the statistics presented are monotonic across28-quartiles except for route-type . this is because of the close-relationship between cost ( per piece , delivery and stop ) , volume 24 '' in-office '' refers to the in the office-activity of a letter-carrier ( primarily sequencing-mail to be delivered ) , '' out-of-office '' refers to the activity of the carrier while on the street . 25 this is based on the city-delivery-carrier total-cost of $ 33.20 per hour . this , in turn , is based on a productive hourly-rate ( pay , overtime-pay , and benefits for hours worked ) increased to account for other costs that can be associated with carriers . these other costs include systemwide-labor related-costs ( e.g. , worker's compensation , civil-service-retirement unfunded-liability ) , indirect-labor such as carrier-supervision , vehicle-costs , and space related-costs ( rents , fuel , utilities , custodial maintenance ) . the standard-work-day for a city-carrier is eight hours . 26 it is a lower bound because the cost includes no marketing or administrative-costs which a stand-alone-firm would normally incur . 27 by `` physical-terrain '' we mean the physical-proximity of the delivery-points and whether they are most advantageously served by a curb , park & loop , or foot-route . 28 a monotonic-series is one whose every term is greater than ( less than ) or equal to the previous-term . 6 ( per piece , delivery and stop ) , and the number of deliveries ( stops ) on a route . with respect to route-type , we see that the percentage of curb-routes is greatest in the most profitable quartile.29 these routes are largely a suburban-phenomenon , they reach more stops in a day and hence , have more volume . the appendix ( table a1 ) presents demographic-characteristics related to the quartiles in table 1 . table 1 selected averages for residential-routes when routes are sorted by profit per route-profit cost ( cents ) per ( possible ) volume-pieces per ( possible ) quartile ( dollars ) piece delivery stop ( pieces ) deliverya-stop a in the paper referenced in n. 9 , supra , pieces per possible-delivery were weighed by stop and produced a slightly higher pieces per delivery . here they are unweighted . the revenue for 46.5 percent of the routes ( all of quartile 4 and most of quartile 3 ) is not enough to cover the costs of the mail delivered on those routes . thus , it might be argued that a monopoly is necessary to ensure service to those households . for several-reasons , it would seem the burden of proof for this position should fall on its proponents . the routes which are unprofitable are dispersed across the country in a great-number of cities . a competitive postal-service that refused to serve households on unprofitable curb-routes deliver directly from the vehicle to a curbside-mail-receptacle . park and loop-routes involve parking , covering an area by foot , then parking the vehicle in a new area . routes would impose large-transaction-costs on its customers to separate-mail and to secure suppliers to deliver its remaining-mail . such firms would be at a considerable-disadvantage to those providing universal-service . larger transaction-networks ( be they mail , packages , overnight or telephone ) are more valuable to customers and providers than smaller networks . it is for sound business-reasons that federal express and united parcel-service provide universal-delivery-service . a major-business-asset of the u.s . postal-service and all other national-posts is that they provide service to every address in the countries they serve . thus , there is a business-incentive for any postal-provider ( who is not simply a cream-skimmer ) to offer universal-service within the territories it serves . routes which are unprofitable when serviced six days per week would become profitable when serviced less frequently . in a competitive-environment , the postal-service could easily retain universal-service , but perhaps not a universal-service standard.30 delivery less than six days per week would certainly be preferable to abandoning-delivery altogether . of course , if the postal-service were to simply abandon delivery to unprofitable-routes , it would not have to refuse , return or destroy mail destined to these routes . delivery-firms with lower costs than the postal-service would emerge to serve them and the postal-service could hand off its unprofitable-mail to them . 31 under any foreseeable circumstances , universal-delivery would not cease.32 e. volume available for cream-skimmers it is unlikely that cream-skimmers would base their selection of areas to serve on the postal-service 's delivery-profits . postal-service delivery-profitability depends on the revenue for all mail delivered , and it is not likely that cream-skimmers could capture all categories of mail . 30 it is interesting to note that united parcel-service recently began-delivery less frequently than daily to certain residential-areas . 31 costs would be lower by dint of lower wages and/or less frequent-delivery . 32 the concept of a universal-service-obligation may really mean more frequent-delivery than economically warranted for households living on unprofitable-routes . this , of course , is in addition to providing retail-services to rural-communities . residential cream-skimmers would serve bulk-mailers with sufficient-volumes of mail for the areas they serve . we assume that only mail that is presorted to the carrier-route-level would be vulnerable to cream-skimming . if a bulk-mailer did not have sufficient-volume to sort to the carrier-route-level , the transaction-costs for both mailer and cream-skimmer would be prohibitive . of course , third parties might become intermediaries between these bulk-mailers and cream-skimmers . such parties would have to engage in processing and transportation . they would in effect be a parallel postal-system for bulk-mailers . an analysis of separate postal-systems for bulk-mailers is beyond the scope of this paper . the u.s . postal-service requires first-class and advertising-mail to have at least ten pieces for a carrier to qualify for a carrier-route-discount . publications may qualify with as few as six pieces for a carrier-route . the amounts being presorted to the carrier-route-level in 1996 are shown in the right-hand-column : first-class-mail is unzoned and receives no discount for being deposited near its destination . most first-class-carrier-route volume is prepared by utilities and may be local depending on the billing-operations of the utility . for purposes of this analysis we assume that all first-class-carrier-route mail is available to local-cream-skimmers . publications mail . while only 3.2 billion pieces of the carrier-route-volume is entered locally or entered close enough to its destination to be available to cream-skimmers , we assume that all 4.5 billion pieces are available to cream-skimmers . advertising-mail . eight-five ( 85 ) percent or 25.2 billion pieces of carrier-route advertising-mail are drop shipped or entered locally . notwithstanding , we assume here that all carrier-route advertising-mail would be available to cream-skimmers . to summarize , 37.7 billion pieces of carrier-route-volume are potentially-available to cream skimmers.33 this represents 20.6 percent of the total-volume of 182.7 billion pieces in 1996 . geographic-cream-skimmers would concentrate on areas with the most carrier-route-volume because their cost per piece would be lowest and their potential-profit would be the greatest . table 2 displays mean daily-route-statistics for routes when divided into quartiles reflecting their volumes of carrier-route-mail . we see a wide-divergence in carrier-route-volume among the quartiles . the range is from 1,263 pieces to 87 pieces with an average of 551 . the first quartile-routes have more than twice the volume of carrier-route-mail as the second quartile . in fact , the first quartile has more than half of all carrier-route-volume delivered on residential-routes . thus , the first quartile of routes are much more attractive-targets for cream-skimmers than the other routes . we again see a monotonic-behavior of the other variables across quartiles.34 route-profitability by quartile in table 2 changes by a sizable-amount as compared to route-profitability in table 1 . less than half the routes in quartile 1 , table 1 , are also in quartile 1 , table 2 . the appendix ( table a2 ) presents demographic-characteristics related to the quartiles in table 2 . 33 some of this mail is delivered by rural-carriers . for purpose of this analysis , we assume that rural-delivery is subject to the same degree of cream-skimming as city-delivery . however , some carrier-route-mail is delivered on business-routes and some is delivered via post-office-boxes and , thus , would not be available to cream-skimmers . consequently , 37.7 billion represents an upper-bound of the volume available to cream-skimmers . 34 the only deviation from the monotonic-behavior in table 2 occurs for deliveries per route between quartiles 2 and 3 . table 2 selected averages for residential-routes when routes are sorted by volume of carrier-route-mail per route-profit cost ( cents ) per ( possible ) quartile ( dollars ) piece delivery stop volume ( pieces ) all carrier-pieces per ( possible ) mail route delivery stop f. estimating the delivery-cost for cream-skimmers cream-skimmers undercut prices charged by an incumbent that has heterogeneous-costs but averaged-prices . cream-skimmers profit by selling low-cost-items at below the incumbents-average-price . delivery-cream-skimmers would attempt to serve those areas where the cost to deliver carrier-route-pieces is the lowest ( i.e. , where the volume of carrier-route-pieces is the highest ) . the first quartile of routes in table 2 would make the best targets . it is this case we examine . in an important-sense , this is an unrealistic-case since quartile 1 represents 40,000 routes which are scattered over more than half the 30,000 5-digit zip code areas in the u.s . it is extremely-unlikely that they constitute all the residential-routes in any 5-digit zip code nor is it likely that they make up the entire suburban-ring around cities . it is unrealistic for cream-skimmers to serve such a fragmented-market . from both an operational and marketing-standpoint , cream-skimmers would have to serve markets with at best a large-proportion of routes in quartile 1 . their markets would undoubtedly contain a large number of routes in the other quartiles . notwithstanding , for analytical-purposes , we assume the best possible-case for cream-skimmers ; that they would be able to serve only routes that fall within quartile 1 . a potential-competitor must decide the level of service to provide and this decision would affect the amount of volume that it could actually capture . many magazines , newspapers , and advertisements must be delivered within a one , two or three-day-window . a competitor delivering only one day a week would have to forego much potential-volume . on the other hand , delivery six days a week would certainly raise the cost per delivered piece and make it less likely that a cream-skimmer would be viable.35 city mail in sweden chose to deliver two days per week ( monday/thursday in some areas and tuesday/friday in other areas ) . in all probability , a cream-skimmer could not prosper unless it could deliver mail at a price less than the incumbent postal-administration . its cost per delivered piece would be a function of its cost of labor and productivity . it would be expected that a cream-skimmer would have a significant labor-cost advantage . its productivity would be influenced by the in-office and out-of-office technology it employed . in 1989 , postal-service carriers spent more than 40 percent of their time in-office preparing for delivery on the street . many mailstreams must be merged and sorted into delivery sequence.36 it is not clear what technology-cream-skimmers would use . moreover , we do not know whether the personnel of a cream-skimmer would be more productive on the street than u.s . postal-service carriers . this analysis will combine these variables ( labor-cost , technology , in-office and out-of-office productivity ) into a single-efficiency-parameter . 35 in a sense , each piece of advertising-mail competes with other advertising-mail for the recipient 's attention . if a cream-skimmer could capture a large-portion of the available-carrier-route volume , its customers might prefer more frequent-delivery to minimize this type of competition . 36 this function is rapidly being automated for letter-size-mail in the u.s . delivery-point barcoded-mail is increasingly being sequenced on sorting-machines , saving significant-in-office delivery-time . from 1989 to 1996 , the percentage of in-office-time for city-carriers has declined from 41 percent to 34 percent . it is expected that this trend will continue . unless a potential-cream skimmer had enough-capital to employ sequencing-automation , the postal-service might have a significant-advantage in sequencing and merging letter-shaped-mail . first class is almost all letter shaped , publications are almost all flat shaped , and carrier-route advertising is 43-percent-letter shaped . g. cream-skimmers cost per piece table 3 has four matrices , each reflecting a different percentage of available-volume assumed to be captured by cream-skimmers . each matrix presents cream-skimmer-unit or per piece-costs based on frequency of delivery and relative-efficiency of the cream-skimmer . we measure relative-efficiency in terms of cream-skimmers cost-relative to the postal-service 's cost . the shaded-cell in the top-matrix , 13.1 cents , is the postal-service cost per piece for delivering only carrier-route presorted-mail in the least expensive-quartile . this number is derived from the 8.7 cent cost of the postal-service delivering all mail in the least expensive-quartile shown in table 2 . if only the carrier-route-mail is delivered , the average delivered volume-decreases from 3,051 to 1,263 in this quartile . the variable-costs drop as the volume-drops , but the fixed-costs are spread over less volume which increases the fixed-costs proportionately . the result is an increase in the unit-costs to 13.1 cents shown in table 3 . going down that column , the costs per piece are displayed assuming a cream-skimmer had the same cost as the u.s . postal-service , but delivers fewer days per week . the costs-decrease by the amount of fixed-costs in delivery . the variable-cost remains the same because the volume does not change . most other national postal-administrations would have a greater percentage of fixed-costs because they have fewer pieces per possible delivery.37 the columns display cream-skimmers ' costs as a function of u.s . postal-service efficiency , expressed as a percentage of the postal-service 's delivery-cost per piece . the 120 percent column displays the cream-skimmer 's per-piece-cost if its cost were 120 percent of the u.s . postal service.38 the 60-percent-column displays the cream-skimmer 's per-piece-cost if its cost were 60 percent of the u.s . postal-service . table 3 cream-skimmer 's cost per piece in cents as a function of efficiency relative to postal-service , days of delivery and percent of carrier-route-mail 100 % of carrier-route-volume captured 75 % of carrier-route-volume captured 50 % of carrier-route-volume captured 25 % of carrier-route-volume captured for all mail the postal-service city-carrier-cost ( fixed and variable ) is 12.5 cents per piece . ( see tables 1 and 2 , cost per piece all routes . ) this is the cost for the delivery-function . each postal-product has a variable-cost for mail-processing , transportation and delivery . each product also has an average incremental ( avoidable ) cost . in the case of advertising-carrier route-mail , the average incremental-cost is about 7 cents.39 if threatened by cream-skimmers , the postal-service could respond by lowering its price towards average incremental-costs . if the postal-service maintained uniform-prices but had competition only in selected areas , it would sacrifice revenue in those areas without competition . these circumstances would probably call for selective discounts ( with average incremental-costs as a floor ) to large-volume mailers40 who would otherwise become customers of cream-skimmers . thus , cream-skimmers would most likely have to have costs no higher than approximately 7 cents per piece in order to compete on a cost-basis alone.41 the postal-service 's productive hourly-wage of more than $ 25 may make it likely that cream-skimmers could obtain some cost-advantage on that basis alone . we do not know how reducing the frequency of delivery would affect demand for alternative-delivery . a two-day-frequency could satisfy a three-day-window , but would miss many delivery dates for time-value-publications . it should also be noted that some customers may not be willing to leave the postal-service for a variety of reasons including the sense of security of dealing with a government-agency . if a cream-skimmer were to capture only 25 percent of the available-market , it would have difficulty succeeding . at that level of market-penetration , its costs would have to be 40 percent of the postal-service 's at a two-day-frequency in order to be below postal-service incremental-costs . with 50 percent of the average volume at a two-day-frequency , a cream-skimmer 's costs would have to be 60 percent or less of the postal-service 's in order to remain below the service 's average incremental-costs . 39 the variable-cost of carrier-route advertising-mail comes predominantly from the delivery-function ( in-office and out-of-office ) . the delivery-function is about 50-percent-variable . thus , the variable-cost of the advertising-carrier route-mail product can be much lower than the average ( fixed and variable ) cost of delivery . the average incremental-cost of advertising-carrier route-mail is only slightly higher than the variable-cost since we estimate it here to consist of variable-costs plus single subclass-stop-costs for 1996 . 40 except for a customer with a very high elasticity of demand , there is no reason for a monopoly to grant-volume based discounts since customers have no alternative-supplier . we understand this was the case with ups , which had a virtual-monopoly in surface parcel-delivery in the u.s. , and did not give discounts to surface parcel customers until roadway package service began to target its most lucrative-customers in the 1980s . ups then began offering discounts to certain large-volume-customers . 41 some mailers currently use cream-skimmers because of service considerations . h. consequences of successful-cream-skimming table 4 shows the required-increase in the u.s . postal-service rates based on the percentage of carrier-route-volume that would be captured by cream-skimmers targeting-mail in quartile 1 , table 2.42 the maximum-effect is an increase of about 1.2 cents in the first-class-rate ( with corresponding-increases in the other classes ) . this would be an increase of nearly 4 percent ; a significant but limited-effect . lifting the letter-mail-monopoly and allowing-cream-skimming would likely have an important-impact on rate-setting for the postal-service 's large-volume carrier-route customers , if our assumptions are correct concerning the amount of volume available for capture by cream-skimmers . the maximum-impact on overall postal-rates is , however , likely to be limited . the negative impact on postal-service 's finances would likely be offset to a great-extent by the effect of limited-competition on the postal service's efficiency , service-performance and product-innovation . table 4 impact of cream-skimming on i . comparison of business and residential-routes we do not analyze cream-skimming on business-routes because only 7 percent of mail-volume delivered on them is carrier-route as compared to 26 percent on residential-routes . this makes them unlikely-candidates for cream-skimming based on our analysis . we compare several-statistics for city residential and business-routes in table 5 . table 5 costs by type of city-delivery-route it can be seen that business-routes have slightly more pieces per route with slightly higher cost per piece.43 the cost per delivery-point and stop on business-routes is much higher , but the profit per piece remains higher.44 we are not aware of any study that has identified the reasons why business-routes have a higher cost per piece and much higher cost per stop than residential-routes . several-factors may contribute , including the high cost of serving each individual-business in office-buildings . in contrast , residential-apartment houses generally have mail-boxes in one central and convenient location for carriers . other factors include the larger proportion of business-mail requiring-signatures and the greater difficulty of getting around in congested-business-areas as opposed to residential and suburban-neighborhoods . because business-routes have much higher cost per delivery-point , they 43 business-routes get much more assistance from routers who sequence the mail in the office , thus saving in-office-time for the carrier . the cost per piece and per delivery-point reflects these extra-costs . 44 profit is higher on business-routes than on residential-routes because of greater volumes of high profit-mail , such as on priority and express . cream-skimming delivery networks might be developed for such mail in business-areas , but are beyond the scope of this paper . are unlikely-candidates for geographic-cream-skimmers who could be expected to have far fewer pieces over which to spread the cost per delivery point.45 j . some differences between the u.s. and other countries the classification-structures in industrial-countries have varying-degrees of efficiency ( defined as adherence to cost ) .46 efficient-classification discourages cream-skimmers because it leaves less cream to skim . the less efficient the classification-structure , the more the administration needs monopoly-protection . the u.s . postal-service 's classification-structure contains several score of cost based discounts and rate-differentials , probably more than any other administration.47 this should tend to make the u.s. less vulnerable to cream-skimming . moreover , the u.s. has more pieces per capita than virtually any other country . because the delivery-function has important-economies of scale , ceteris-paribus , the u.s. should have lower per piece-costs than virtually every other country . this factor also makes the u.s. less vulnerable to cream-skimming . in addition , the proportion of fixed-cost in the delivery-network is largely a function of volume per capita ( per delivery ) . the larger the volume per capita , the larger the proportion of variable-costs and the smaller the proportion of fixed-costs . since virtually every other postal-administration has less volume per capita than the u.s. , a larger proportion of their delivery-costs are fixed relative to the u.s. a cream-skimmer can reduce its fixed-cost relative to an incumbent simply by reducing the number of days of delivery . thus , a cream-skimmer would obtain less cost-advantage by cutting-delivery-frequency in the u.s. than in countries with less per capita-volume . this also tends to make the u.s. less vulnerable to cream-skimming than other countries.48 45 of course , messenger-services are common in central-business districts , but this is for reasons of service and not cost . 46 the most efficient-classification-structure would be based on costs alone and would offer worksharing-discounts wherever practical . these discounts would equal the cost-savings . no postal-administration meets this standard nor do the authors recommend that they do . 47 advertising-mail alone has over 60 different-rate-categories with rate-differentials based on shape and discounts for presorting , barcoding and drop-shipping . 48 a consequence of this is that an administration which delivers five days per week , ceteris-paribus , is a more difficult-target for cream-skimmers than one which delivers six days per week . on the other hand , some factors appear to make the u.s . postal-service more vulnerable than other postal-administrations to cream-skimming . few , if any , countries have as large a proportion of carrier-route-volume as does the u.s . this is the mail most susceptible to diversion . in addition , few postal-administrations pay their employees as large a wage-premium as does the u.s . postal service.49 a wage-premium allows cream-skimmers to obtain an efficiency/cost advantage simply by paying the prevailing-wage . 49 see cohen , chu , ferguson & xenakis , `` a cross sectional comparison and analysis of productivity for 21 national postal-administrations . '' managing-change in the postal and delivery industries , ed . crew & kleindorfer , kluwer academic-publishers , 1997 . appendix this paper 's analysis is based on volume and delivery-statistics from 13,212 residential-carrier-routes . these routes were extracted from the carrier-cost survey ( ccs ) , conducted by the u.s . postal-service in 1989 . in addition to the volume and delivery-statistics for each of the 13,212 residential-routes , ccs provides the associated 5-digit zip code served by each route . a zip code may be served by many routes . the data presented in this appendix are based on the demographic-data for the 5-digit zip code for each route in a quartile . thus , the demographic-data for the same 5-digit zip code could be averaged into the totals for two different-quartiles . this would happen if two routes from the same 5-digit zip code were in separate-quartiles . the united states bureau of the census has grouped the 1990 census of population and housing-data using 5-digit zip-codes . the file ( stf 3b ) is available in three cds of about 1.4 gigabytes ( gbs ) and contains socio-economic-data for 29,467 5-digit zip-codes served by the u.s . postal-service . the puerto rico zip-codes are not included in stf 3b file . by merging the stf 3b file with ccs data , we have obtained economic and demographic-data for the zip-codes in which 12,876 residential-routes reside . we could not obtain any socio-economic information for the zip-codes of 336 residential-routes ( most of them in puerto rico ) because their zip-codes were not included in the stf 3b file . tables a1 through a3 provide statistics for age , household-income , and education-attainment for the 5-digit zip code for the 12,876 residential-routes in ccs . table a1 presents the statistics by quartile when routes are sorted by profitability . tables a2 and a3 present the statistics by quartile and decile respectively when routes are sorted by carrier-route-volume . the statistics in table a1 show that , on average , routes in the more profitable-quartiles reside in zip-codes with higher-income-households and more educated adults . likewise , the statistics in tables a2 and a3 show that routes with high carrier-route-volume reside in zip-codes with higher levels of household-income and education-attainment .
