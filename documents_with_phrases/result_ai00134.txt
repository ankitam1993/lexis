accounting and information-management division april 2000 executive-guide creating-value through world-class financial-management gao/aimd-00-134 preface to help promote effective-implementation of federal financial-management-reform , we studied the financial-management-practices and improvement-efforts of nine leading-public and private sector finance-organizations to identify the success-factors , practices , and outcomes associated with worldclass-financial management . this executive-guide is intended to assist federal-agencies in achieving the objectives of the chief financial-officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and subsequent related-legislation by providing-case-studies of 11 practices critical for establishing and maintaining-sound financial operations . the reforms laid out by the cfo act and subsequent related-legislation , when effectively implemented , will place the federal government on par with private-sector-corporations and state and local governments that have already made the necessary-investment in financial-management . while many agencies have made great-strides toward generating more accurate and reliable annual financial statements , the process of preparing financial statements and subjecting them to independent-audit is only the first step toward satisfying the requirements of the legislation . to reap the full-benefits of financial-reform , federal-finance-organizations must go beyond the audit-opinion toward ( 1 ) establishing seamless-systems and processes , ( 2 ) routinely generating reliable-cost and performance-information and analysis , ( 3 ) undertaking other valueadded-activities that support strategic decisionmaking and mission-performance , and ( 4 ) building a finance-team that supports the agency 's mission and goals . this executive-guide was prepared under the direction of lisa g. jacobson , director , defense audits . other gao contacts and key-contributors are listed in appendix viii . questions can be directed to me at ( 202 ) 5122600 , steinhoffj.aimd @ gao.gov , or linda garrison , assistant director , by phone , email , or regular-mail at the following : jeffrey c. steinhoff acting assistant comptroller general-accounting and information-management division contents background learning from leading-organizations background creating a government that runs more efficiently and effectively has been a public-concern for decades . in recent years , however , the push towards creating a smaller , more results-oriented-government has intensified the urgency to find ways to do more with less . to effectively evaluate and improve the value derived from government-programs and spending , the congress and other decisionmakers must have accurate and reliable financial information on program-cost and performance . further , they must be able to rely on federal-finance-organizations to provide analysis and insight about the financial-implications of program-decisions and the impact of those decisions on agency-performance-goals and objectives . currently , financial-data are not always-useful , relevant , timely , and reliable-enough to be used for federal decisionmaking , and many federal-finance-organizations are not yet well equipped enough to routinely provide analysis or advice related to this information . in the private sector , the role of the finance-organization historically has centered on oversight and control , focusing on its fiduciary-responsibilities and paying less attention to increasing the effectiveness of operating-divisions . however , over the past decade , dramatic-changes in the business environment have driven finance-organizations to reevaluate this role . increased competition resulting from an emerging global market has put pressure on finance-organizations to find new ways to reduce administrative-costs , add value , and provide a competitive advantage . at the same time , advances in information technology have made it possible for the finance-function to shift from a paperdriven , labor intensive , clerical-role to a more consultative role as advisor , strategist , analyst , and business-partner . according to a 1997 study performed by a major-public-accounting firm,1 most cfos in 1989 were spending 75 to 80 percent of their time on fiduciary-issues , essentially external-reporting . today , the goal of many leading-finance-organizations is to spend about 20 percent of their time on fiduciary-issues and the remaining-time performing strategic-support-activities , such as cost-analysis or business-performance-analysis . also , a 1996 report by the institute of management-accountants found that over the previous 5 to 10 years , management-accountants were increasingly being asked to supplement their traditional-accounting-role with more financial-analysis and management consulting.2 dramatic-changes also have occurred in federal financial-management in response to the most comprehensive-management-reform legislation of the past 40 years . the combination of reforms ushered in by ( 1 ) the cfo act of 1990 , ( 2 ) the government-management reform act ( gmra ) of 1994 , ( 3 ) the federal financial-management-improvement act ( ffmia ) of 1996 , ( 4 ) the government-performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993 , and ( 5 ) the clingercohen-act of 1996 will , if successfully implemented , provide the necessary-foundation to run an effective , resultsoriented-government . 1 reinventing the cfo : moving from financial-management to strategic-management ( coopers and lybrand , new york , new york : 1997 ) . 2 the practice-analysis of management accounting , institute of management-accountants ( montvale , new jersey : 1996 ) . 4 the cfo act and gmra spelled out a long overdue and ambitious-agenda to help the government remedy its lack of useful , relevant , timely , and reliable financial information . for the government's major-departments and agencies , this legislation ( 1 ) established chief financial-officer-positions , ( 2 ) required audited financial statements annually , and ( 3 ) set-expectations for agencies to develop and deploy more modern financial-management-systems , produce sound-cost and operating-performance-information , and design-results oriented reports on the government 's financial condition by integrating-budget , accounting , and program-information . ffmia built on the cfo act and gmra by requiring financial-statement-auditors to report whether agencies' financial-systems comply with federal financial-management-systems requirements , federal-accounting-standards , and the u.s. government standard general-ledger . the government-performance and results act of 1993commonly know as gpra or the results actwas enacted to hold federal-agencies accountable for achieving-program-results . it requires that agencies ( 1 ) set multiyear strategic-goals and corresponding annual-goals , ( 2 ) measure-performance toward the achievement of those goals , and ( 3 ) report on their progress . effective-implementation of the results act , however , hinges on agencies ' ability to routinely produce meaningful-budget , accounting , and program-information needed to manage performance and measure-results . the cfo act and other related financial-reform-legislation , if successfully implemented , will provide the basis for producing this information . to help insure that agencies effectively use-information-technology to achieve program-results , the congress passed the clingercohen-act of 1996 . the clingercohen-act builds on the best-practices of leading-public and private-sector-organizations by requiring-agencies to better link their information-technology-planning and investment-decisions to program-missions and goals . the clingercohen-act contains critical-provisions requiring federal-agencies to use investment and capital-planning processes to manage their information-management technology portfolios . further , it requires that agencies modernize inefficient administrative and missionrelated-work processes before making significant-technology-investments to support them . implemented together , these measures provide a basis for improving-accountability over government-operations and routinely producing sound-cost and operating-performance-information , thereby making it possible to better assess and improve the government's financial condition and operating performance . learning from leading-organizations to help promote effective-implementation of federal financial-management-reform , we studied the financial-management-practices and improvement-efforts of nine leading private and public sector finance-organizations to identify the success-factors , practices , and outcomes associated with worldclass-financial management . the six private sector and three state-organizations we studied have been recognized by their peers and other independent-researchers for their outstanding financial-management-practices and successful finance reengineering-efforts . for more information on the criteria we used to select these organizations , see appendix i . as federal-agencies continue to improve their management and financial-accountability , they will be able to draw upon the expertise and experience of these private sector and state government-organizations . leading-finance-organizations at one time , all of these organizations found themselves in an environment similar to the one confronting federal-agencies todayone in which they were called upon to improve financial-management while simultaneously reducing-costs . the key-practices drawn from the organizations we examined can provide a useful-framework for federal-agencies working to improve their financial-management . this guide discusses the goals , success-factors , and practices associated with building a worldclass-finance-organization . specifically , we have identified 4 overall-goals common to these leading-organizations along with 11 practices that were critical to their ability to meet these goals . in addition , this guide includes examples from our case-study-work that best illustrate how each practice enabled the selected organization to achieve the desired-outcomes . we preceded our case-study-work with an extensive-review of financial-management-literature , guides , and reports . we also consulted with leading-public and private-sector-experts in financial-management . case-study-data were collected through interviews and analysis of documentation . further , the case-study-organizations reviewed all case-study-information included in this guide for accuracy and completeness . appendix i provides a more detailed-description of our research-objectives , scope , and methodology . 6 characteristics of a worldclass-finance-organization a worldclass-finance-organization can best be defined in terms of the business-outcomes it producesoutcomes such as improved business-analysis , innovative-solutions to business-problems , reduced-operating-costs , increased-capability to perform adhoc analysis , and improved overall-business-performance . to build a worldclass-finance-organization and help achieve better business-outcomes , each of the organizations we examined set an agenda for transforming the finance-organization by defining a `` shared-vision '' -i.e. , a mission , a vision for the future , core-values , goals , and strategies- geared toward making the finance-organization a valuecreating , customerfocused-partner in business-results . although the techniques used varied depending on the organization 's size and culture and some efforts were more mature than others , the goals , practices , and success-factors outlined in the following-illustration were instrumental in the organization achieving its vision . goals , practices , and strategies to consider this section summarizes the results of our research and case-study-work . specifically , it contains the 4 overall-goals and 11 practices we identified as critical for building a worldclass-finance-organization . to facilitate the practical-use of this guide , information is organized into four sections-each summarizing one of the four goals as well as those practices that have enabled leading-organizations to achieve these goals . further , for each of the 11 practices , we provided ( 1 ) a summary of key-characteristics , ( 2 ) illustrative-case-study examples , and ( 3 ) strategies for federal-agencies to consider when implementing the practice . 8 make financial-management an entitywide-priority the quality and image of federal financial-management has suffered from decades of neglect and an organizational-culture that has not fully recognized the value of good financial-managementnot even at its most basic-levelas a means of ensuring-accountability . making financial-management a priority throughout the federal government involves changing the organizational-culture of federal-agencies . although the views about how an organization can change its culture vary considerably , the organizations we studied identified leadership as the most important-factor in successfully making cultural-changes . top-management must be totally committed in both words and actions to changing the culture , and this commitment must be sustained and demonstrated to staff . the leading-organizations we studied made financial-management-improvement an entitywide-priority by building a foundation of control and accountability that supports external-reporting and performance-management , providing clear strong-executive leadership , and using-training to change the organizational-culture and engage line-management . practice 1 build a foundation of control and accountability that supports external-reporting and performance-management key-characteristics • the financial-reporting and audit-process is a basic management and oversight-tool . • accountability is part of the organizational-culture and goes well beyond receiving an unqualified-audit-opinion . • internal-controls meet both external financial-reporting and performance-management control-objectives without significantly impacting-efficiency . a solid-foundation of control and accountability requires a system of checks and balances that provides reasonable-assurance that the entity 's transactions are appropriately recorded and reported , its assets protected , its established-policies followed , and its resources used economically and efficiently for the purposes intended . the private sector and state-organizations we visited built and maintained this foundation largely through the discipline of preparing routine periodic financial statements and annually subjecting them to an independent-audit . however , senior executives at leading-organizations recognize that the financial information demanded by decisionmakers to measure and manage performance requires greater precision and more timely-access than that required to receive an unqualified-opinion on the entity's financial statements . to ensure that decisionmakers have useful , relevant , timely , and reliable-information , leading-finance-organizations establish accountability-goals that extend well beyond receiving an unqualified-audit-opinion . in addition , the internal-controls at these organizations are designed to efficiently meet the control-objectives necessary for performance-measurement and management as well as external financial-reporting . similarly , according to a 1998 survey of federal cfos,3 federal-finance-organizations continue to expand their focus from audited financial statements to include performance-measurement and strategic-planning . for example , the cfo council and the office of management and budget ( omb ) are aggressively working on eight priority-initiatives outlined in the1998 federal financial-management status-report and fiveyear plan . although one of the eight priorities focused on obtaining an unqualified-opinion on agency financial statements , the eight priorities taken as a whole aim at improving the financial and performance-information needed to make and implement effective-policy , management , stewardship , and program-decisions . 3 cfo survey : preparing for tomorrow 's way of doing business , grant thornton llp and the association of government-accountants ( alexandria , virginia : march 1998 ) . gao/aimd00134 ♦ executive-guide : creating-value through worldclass-financial management 10 goals , practices , and strategies to consider ♦ make financial-management an entitywide-priority ♦ practice 1 case-studies accountability-goals and an effective-control-structure provide the basis for a more resultsoriented-government commonwealth of virginia to build a foundation of control and accountability , senior government-leaders in the commonwealth of virginia had clear-goals and objectives that went beyond receiving an unqualified-audit-opinion . with the passage of the single audit act in 1984 , the commonwealth of virginia had to produce and have audited comprehensive annual financial-reports ( cafr ) for the first time . although not required by the act , the state-comptroller had each state-agency also produce audited financial statements , thereby ensuring-accountability at every level of government rather than solely at those levels considered material to cafr . the goal was to ensure that managers and lawmakers would have useful , relevant , and timely-information for assessing and managing-program performance . now that virginia routinely receives an unqualified-opinion on its cafr , only those state-agencies with a specific need ( e.g. , agencies ' operating-trust , enterprise and internal-service-funds ) are required to produce auditable financial statements . the remaining-agencies now are required to certify the accuracy of financial information that feeds cafr . by subjecting all state-agencies to the rigorous-discipline of preparing financial-reports and having them audited , the comptroller increased-accountability for data-accuracy beyond that required to receive an unqualified-audit-opinion . state officials continue to raise the bar and seek new ways to increase-accountability and improve the state's performance . for example , the department of planning and budget currently performs trend-analysis and prepares fiscal-impact statements for the state 's legislature , using useful , relevant , and timely financial information from the state 's integrated-budget and accounting-systems . also , to ensure that performance-data and longrange-plans drive budget-decisions , the state has set-goals , including implementing an activitybased-accounting and budgeting system , for enhancing its performance-budgeting process . texas similarly , in texas the performance-management-system is an integral part of agency and statewide-planning-structures , evaluation and decisionmaking-processes , and accountability-systems . creating and maintaining a performance-management-system required close , consistent , and coordinated attention above and beyond that required for external financial-reporting-purposes . in texas , the ability to produce fairly-stated external financial-reports was only the first step in building a more effective , resultsoriented-government . an unqualified-opinion on the state's cafr provided , assurance that financial information was accurate and reliable for evaluating its overall financial position . however , an unqualified-audit-opinion by itself does not ensure that the information needed to measure and manage performance is useful , relevant , timely , or reliable . the internal-controls that were considered adequate for external financial-reporting were not always-sufficient for performance-management . for example , internal-controls over expenditure-data met the control-objectives for aggregating and reporting this information on the financial statements ; however , they did not meet the objectives for calculating perunitcost-efficiency-measures required for performance-management . therefore , state-agencies , with the help of the state auditor's office , reevaluated and redesigned agency internal-controls to meet both external financial-reporting and performance-management control-objectives . because the state routinely receives an unqualified-opinion on its cafr , the state auditor 's office and agency internal-auditors no longer spend the bulk of their time on control-issues related to external financial-reporting . instead , their focus is on improving the reliability of performance-management information . strategies to consider to build a foundation of control and accountability , senior executives could : • leverage audit-resources and the financial-statement-audit process to improve data-reliability and increase-accountability . • increase-accountability by establishing-goals for ( 1 ) producing financial and performance-reports for major-programs and/or business-segments and ( 2 ) moving the organization toward more frequent financial-reporting ( e.g. , quarterly , monthly ) . • as part of the agency 's gpra performance-planning process , ( 1 ) establish efficiency-criteria that measure the cost associated with program-outcomes and ( 2 ) develop an approach for assessing and improving-agency internal-controls over financerelated-efficiency-measures . • use-accounting and operational-performance-data to support-budget-formulation and strategic-planning . 12 practice 2 provide clear , strong-executive leadership key-characteristics • the chief executive recognizes the important role the finance-organization can play in improving overall-business-performance and involves key business/line managers in financial-management-improvement initiatives . • the cfo is a member of the top-management-team . • top-executives ' sustained-commitment to improving financial-management is reinforced through both their words and actions . a powerful , visionary-leader can change the direction , culture , and perceptions of the finance-organization . the chief executive-officers ( ceo ) of leading-organizations understand the important role the cfo and the finance-organization play in improving the entity 's overall-business-performance . consequently , the cfo is a central-figure on the top-management-team and heavily involved in strategic-planning and decisionmaking . in addition , the senior executives at these organizations demonstrated their sustained-commitment to financerelated-improvement-initiatives by using-key business/line managers to drive improvement-efforts , attending-key meetings , ensuring that the necessary-resources are made available , and creating a system of rewards and incentives to recognize those who support improvement-initiatives . in fact , the committed-support of the ceo and line-management are critical to the success of financerelated-improvement-initiatives . in the same way , federal financial-management-reform has recently gained-momentum through the committed-support of top federal-leaders . for example , the president has made financial-management-improvement a top priority and established a goal to obtain an unqualified-opinion on the government 's financial statements . to achieve this goal , he directed the head of each agency without an unqualified-audit-opinion to submit to the omb ( 1 ) an initial-plan for resolving financial-reporting-deficiencies and ( 2 ) quarterly-progress-reports for achieving the goal . further , omb is required to periodically report to the vice-president on the agency-submissions and governmentwide-progress . in addition , many federal-cfos have primary-leadership-responsibility for implementing the results act at the department or agency-level . the cfo council has played a key-leadership-role in establishing financial and performance-improvement-goals and priorities for changing the way federal-agencies plan , budget , manage , evaluate , and account for federal-programs . to ensure that federal financial-management-improvement efforts succeed and that the president 's and the cfo council 's priorities are achieved , the support and involvement of key-nonfinancial executives and managers is critical . this commitment starts with the heads of agencies establishing-priorities and setting-expectations and continues with the active-involvement of program/line managers and executives in driving financial-improvement-initiatives . strategies to consider to demonstrate and reinforce commitment to improving financial-management , heads of agencies and senior executives could : • form an executive-management-team ( heads of component organizations and those reporting directly to the agency-head ) to establish a vision and fundamental-goals and provide sponsorship for each major financial-management-improvement project . • involve key-program /business managers in driving financial-improvement-initiatives . • develop a plan to ensure that all key-constituents visibly support financial-management-improvement initiatives . • actively market the program-benefits of financial-management-improvement efforts to secure the necessary-resources and congressional-support . • establish an expectation that top financial-executives , as part of the top-management-team , provide forward looking analysis that creates a link between accounting-information and budget-formulation and contributes to strategic-planning and decisionmaking . practice 3 key-characteristics use training to change the • nonfinancial-managers are educated about the financial-implications of business organizational-culture and decisions . engage line-management • training and tools are provided to facilitate and accelerate the pace of change-initiatives . improving federal financial-management hinges upon leadership's ability to manage change and create an organizational-culture that values good financial-management . legislation starting with the cfo act of 1990 has been directed at enhancing the finance-organization 's responsibilities in supporting the management of federal-activities . although acceptance by the program-offices has sometimes been slow , according to a recent-survey of federal cfos,4 program-directors are starting to look to the finance-organization for help . they attribute the change to a joint-effort by program and finance-offices to implement the results act and develop strategic-plans . in addition , the cfo council 's numerous-outreach efforts and gprarelated-education-events have helped to win the acceptance of program-managers . the key to successfully managing-change and changing organizational-culture is gaining the support of line-management . to change the organizational-culture and enlist the support of line-managers , many organizations utilize training-programs . some are generic in nature and are intended to help people anticipate and cope with change and ensure that every person in the organization understands the need for change . others are specifically geared towards providing-line-managers with a greater appreciation of the financial-implications of their business-decisions . through these interactions , financial-managers gain a better understanding of business-problems and nonfinancial-managers gain an appreciation of the value of financial information . this not only produces better managers , it also helps break down functional-barriers that can affect productivity and impede improvement-efforts . in addition , these organizations provide tools to facilitate and accelerate the pace of the change-initiative . according to one executive we met with , change-initiatives that are implemented slowly generally fail because staff have too much time to contemplate the potential negative-effects that change might bring and rally opposition that ultimately undermines the effort . 4 cfo survey : preparing for tomorrow 's way of doing business , grant thornton llp and the

pace of change the boeing company to ensure that nonfinancial-managers at all levels understand the value of financial information , boeing has developed an education-program that teaches managers basic-business-competence . using a threestep development planning-process , managers assess their current-capabilities , determine their specific-development needs , and build and execute a development-plan . ( see appendix ii . ) depending on individual need , boeing offers a variety of learning-experiences including-selfpaced , team , classroom , case-study , and simulation . for example , through boeing 's creating-value learning project , managers learn how to recognize the importance of cash flow and its influence on business-decisions , understand shareholder-expectations and the consequences of not meeting them , and identify the relationship between individual-decisions and actions and shareholder value . the information is presented in a `` multiple-media '' format in order to accommodate different-learning-styles and to allow learning to occur in different-environments and in periods best suited to the learner . other learning-experiences include course-work , such as elements of product-cost , in which participants analyze and use cost-element-information to support decisionmaking related to improvement-efforts , ensuring that resources are applied to those activities that return the greatest benefits and provide the highest value to customers . during the class , participants learn to apply unit-cost-principles to the products they produce as well as how process , activity , and individual-cost-elements , such as labor , materials , and overhead , are accumulated to become unit or product-cost . general electric general electric 's ( ge ) education and training-programs have played a crucial-role in changing the organizational-culture and facilitating both financial and nonfinancial-improvement initiatives . one of the most successful-programs is the change acceleration process ( cap ) workshop . during the cap workshop , ge managers and professional-staff are given tools and taught strategies for removing cultural-barriers to change . ge 's finance-organization has used these tools and strategies to facilitate improvement-initiatives , ranging from organizational-restructuring to changing the role of the internal-audit-function . to be successful , the project-teams spearheading these initiatives had to achieve each of the following-objectives : ( 1 ) lead-change , ( 2 ) create a shared need , ( 3 ) shape a vision , ( 4 ) mobilize commitment , ( 5 ) make change last , ( 6 ) monitor progress , and ( 7 ) change-systems and structures . to ensure that each objective would be accomplished , the team used a survey to profile the change-process and measures its progress . staff and managers were surveyed periodically and asked to score each of the five dimensions from 100 percent to 0 percent based on how well they think each is being accomplished . for change to be successful , most dimensions must be rated high . the profile directed the team 's efforts so that they could develop a strategy to address the areas that needed the most attention . for example , mobilizing-commitment , especially from those outside the finance-organization , was often one of the more difficult-objectives to accomplish . however , the team used a method , learned in the cap workshop , for analyzing and increasing stakeholder-commitment-levels . first , the team listed the names of those individuals whose support was critical for the success of the project . then , they assessed each stakeholder 's level of commitment based on their perceived level of agreementto what degree does the individual agree that change is needed ? if the team perceived a person did not agree , it developed an individual-plan to get this person 's support . plans were developed by addressing-questions such as : why are they resisting this change ? do they have a vested-interest in the status quo ? what new opportunities will they have when the change is implemented ? and who influences this person and what is their level of acceptance ? strategies to consider to engage line-management and create a culture that values good financial-management , heads of agencies and senior executives could : • identify key financial and nonfinancial-managers and staff whose support is critical to the success of financial-management-improvement initiatives . • develop curriculum and provide training that teaches key-nonfinancial managers and staff • how to use financial information to improve operational planning and decisionmaking and • how reform-legislation ( e.g . cfo act , gmra , ffmia , gpra ) will affect operating-unit-roles , responsibilities , and processes within the context of specific-agency-operations . • for all key-managers and staff , develop curriculum and provide training that provides a framework and tools that can be used to facilitate and accelerate the pace of change-initiatives . 18 redefine the role of finance to better support-mission-objectives in the private sector , the role of the finance-organization historically has centered on oversight and control , focusing on its fiduciary-responsibilities and external financial-reporting requirements . however , over the past decade dramatic-changes in the business environment have forced finance-organizations to reevaluate this role . the pressure to reduce administrative-costs resulting from competition in an emerging global market drove many finance-organizations to find more efficient-ways to deliver their services . nonetheless , becoming more efficient is not enough to remain competitive . today , leading-finance-organizations are focusing more on internal-customer-requirements by providing products and services that directly support strategic decisionmaking and ultimately improve overall-business-performance . similarly , competition has changed the environment in which federal-agencies operate . shrinking-budgets have increased competition for scarce-resources , requiring-managers to make tough resource-allocation-decisions that may affect program-delivery . without the support of federal-finance-organizations , program-managers may not be able to determine or defend the cost associated with or benefits derived from government-activities . we found the leading-finance-organizations we visited had redefined the role of finance to better support-mission-objectives by assessing the finance-organization 's current-role in meeting-mission-objectives , maximizing the efficiency of daytoday-accounting-activities , and organizing-finance to add value . practice 4 assess the finance-organization 's current-role in meeting-mission-objectives key-characteristics • the percentage of resources spent on strategic-support-activities is used as an indicator of how well finance is supporting-mission-objectives . • benchmarking and customer-feedback is used to identify performance-gaps and best-practices . many leading-finance-organizations assess their current-role in supporting-mission-objectives by comparing the percentage of staff-time spent on strategic-support-activities , such as business-performance-analysis or cost-analysis , with the percentage of resources spent on transaction-processing and other routine-accounting-activities . according to a 1995 financial-executives research foundation report,5 transaction-processing and other routine-accounting-activities , such as accounts-payable , payroll , and external-reporting , consume about 69 percent of costs within finance . other studies indicate that these activities consume as much as 80 percent of finance 's resources . while transaction-processing will always exist , it does not have to drain the finance-organization 's resources . therefore , many leading-finance-organizations have calculated and compared these percentages as a general-indication of how well they supported the organization's business-objectives . a goal for many leading-organizations is to reduce the time spent on transaction-processing-activities to 20 percent . to further assess the efficiency and effectiveness of specific products and services , many of the leading-finance-organizations we studied relied on benchmarking6 and customer-feedback . for example , comparisons against worldclass-benchmarks , such as closing the books in less than 4 days or processing-payroll at $ 1.39 per transaction , were used to identify activities or processes in need of improvement . ( see appendix iii : worldclass performance-metrics . ) in addition , these organizations used-feedback from their internal-customers to gather specific-information related to quality and customer-expectations . for example , hewlettpackard 's finance-organization conducted a detailed-survey of about 200 internal-customers worldwide in which customers were asked to rank certain components , or services , as either high or low in terms of both importance and satisfaction . the survey-results were then used to guide-improvement-initiatives . 5 reengineering the finance-function , financial-executives research foundation , executive report , vol . 2 , no . 3 ( june 1995 ) . 6 benchmarking is the continuous-process of measuring-products , services , and practices against the toughest competitors or those organizations recognized as industry-leaders . gao/aimd00134 ♦ executive-guide : creating-value through worldclass-financial management 20 goals , practices , and strategies to consider ♦ redefine the role of finance to better support-mission-objectives ♦ practice 4 case-study assessing and revising the organization 's charter , processes , products , and services enables finance to better support-business-objectives the role of pfizer 's finance-organization has changed significantly over the past several years , from an organization focused primarily on control and compliance , to one that is integral to making strategic-business-decisions . about 6 years ago , under the leadership of pfizer 's ceo and cfo , pfizer 's corporate finance-organization embarked on a reengineering-initiative to transform its charter , processes , products , and services . the ceo and cfo 's vision was to make pfizer `` the preeminent corporate finance-organization in the industry . '' at the heart of this vision was the concept that the finance-organization should actively support the strategic-imperatives of pfizer inc . unlike many finance-organizations going through this type of transformation , pfizer 's change-effort was not in reaction to a crisis . in fact , given the company 's long history of profitable growth , there seemed to be little-reason to change . pfizer 's cfo , on the other hand , saw an opportunity to do things more effectively and efficiently and thereby redeploy-resources from transactional activities ( e.g. , closing the books , preparing-tax-returns , paying invoices ) to value-added-activities ( e.g. , operations , treasury and tax-planning ) . the finance-organization , for example , was producing too much-data and not enough-information . to build a case for change , pfizer 's cfo initiated a benchmarking-survey to determine exactly how his organization stacked up against the other leading-finance-organizations . the results dramatized the magnitude of the opportunity . for example , pfizer took 7 days to close its books versus the 3 to 4 day worldclass-standard . further , it cost pfizer twice as much as the benchmark-average to pay an invoice . this sobering news served a vital-purposeit created a sense of urgency surrounding the need to change and helped the cfo rally the organizational-support needed to institute a comprehensive-reengineering-initiative to facilitate change within the finance-organization , several crossfunctional process-improvement-teams were established . through comprehensive-revisions to its charter , processes , organization and systems , pfizer has reduced the cost associated with transaction-processing-activities by up to 50 percent in certain-functions and shifted its focus to activities that directly support pfizer's business-objectives . the shift in focus and resources has allowed pfizer 's finance-organization to become a `` growth-enabler '' on behalf of the company by : • supplying the necessary-resources ( from information to capital ) ; • providing increased opportunities to invest ( redeploy financial-gains or savings on behalf of the business ) ; • offering-business-solutions ( `` how , '' not `` why not '' ) ; and • assisting in making the right-business decisions . strategies to consider to assess the finance-organization 's current-role in meeting-mission-objectives , agency-cfos and senior-finance-executives could : • identify all major-functions performed by the finance-organization ( e.g. , accounts-payable , payroll , performance-reporting , performance-analysis ) and group each function into meaningful-categories ( e.g. , transaction-processing , control and compliance , mission-support ) . • establish and monitor agency specific-performance-goals and measures that reflect the finance-organization 's role in meeting-mission-objectives ( i.e. , the percentage of time or resources devoted to mission-support vs. transaction-processing or control and compliance-activities ) . • benchmark financial-management-practices and processes with recognized industry-leaders ( e.g . the cost of finance as a percentage of total-outlays , unit-cost per accounting-transaction ) in order to measure-performance and identify best-practices . • to the extent that operating in a federal-environment affects specific-benchmarks , compare financial-management-practices and processes with other federal-agencies to provide a context with which to interpret benchmarking-results . • periodically survey internal-customers to obtain information related to the quality and value of the products and services they receive and use this information to guide-improvement-initiatives . 22 practice 5 maximize the efficiency of daytoday-accounting-activities key-characteristics • inefficient-processes are eliminated or streamlined . • transaction-processing-activities are consolidated , standardized , and reengineered at shared-service-centers . • the cost and benefits of outsourcing routine-accounting-activities are considered . as part of an overall-strategy to reduce the cost of finance and better support-business-objectives , many leading-organizations have reduced the number of staff required to perform routine-transaction processing-activities by eliminating or streamlining inefficient-processes and/or consolidating these activities at shared-services-centers . similarly , some federal-agencies are aggressively expanding their use of electronic funds transfer to include contract-payments and travel-payments as a means of increasing the efficiency of their routine-accounting-activities . each of the six private sector finance-organizations we visited consolidated , standardized , and reengineered routine-processes , such as accounts-payable , fixed-asset accounting , and payroll at shared-service-centers . the primary-objective for moving to shared services is to reduce operating costs . however , other benefits included better control and standardization of processes , more costeffective-technology-deployment , and an enhanced-position for continual-improvement and customer service . although their approach varied depending on the size , culture , and industry , leading-organizations have realized the benefits of shared services by completing each of the following-stages . the first stage is consolidation and includes changing the organizational-structure and gaining-control over processes . the second stage is standardization and entails changing-processes , adopting a common-technology-platform , and continuous-improvement . the final-stage is reengineering and involves changing-workflow and leveraging-technology through the use of electronic-commerce , data-warehousing , and document-imaging . similar to the findings in our previous-report on outsourcing the finance function,7 we found that although outsourcing is considered an option for reducing-costs and improving-efficiency , none of the leading-organizations we visited were currently outsourcing any significant-aspect of their finance-organizations . the primary-reason for not outsourcing is due to the limited capacity of outsourcing-vendors to perform larger , more complex finance and accounting-operations . however , these organizations indicated that they are continually evaluating-opportunities to reduce costs and improve quality ; therefore , as the outsourcing market evolves and the capacity and quality of outsourcing-vendors improves , outsourcing may become a more attractive-alternative . 7 financial-management : outsourcing of finance and accounting functions ( gao/aimd/nsiad9843 ) . gao/aimd00134 ♦ executive-guide : creating-value through worldclass-financial management case-study effectively implementing shared-service-centers can result in reduced-operating-costs and better customer-support over the past decade , hightech-companies have seen their gross margins shrink smaller and smaller as a result of increased competition and the steady-introduction of newer , faster , and more advanced-technology . to remain competitive and ensure continued growth , hewlett packard formed a task-force to find ways to reduce the cost of the finance-organization . at the time , the cost of finance was 2.8 percent of company-revenues and accounting-transaction-costs were more than two to three times that of comparable-companies . the task-force recommended that hewlett packard consolidate its transaction-processing-activities such as accounts-payable , accounts receivable , payroll , and fixed assets accounting from over 100 decentralized centers into just 8 financial service-centers worldwide . as a result , the number of employees needed to process accounting-transactions was reduced by more than halffrom about 2,500 to only 1,200 employees worldwide . by implementing the financial service-centers , hewlett packard reduced the costs of its finance-organization from 2.8 percent of revenues in 1989 to 1.4 percent in 1994 and to less than 1.0 percent by 1998 . the company 's finance-costs are now in the top quartile of comparable-organizations . however , creating a shared-service-center was much more than simply centralizing-activities and cashing in on economies of scale . to achieve these cost-savings and provide innovative , costeffective shared business-services , hewlett packard not only had to consolidate its activities , but it also had to reengineer its processes and change its organizational-structure . at one financial service-center , processreengineering initiatives alone have resulted in cost-savings of $ 36 million since 1990 . through the use of electronic-data-interchange , document-imaging , and common-software-platforms , the center has maximized its use of human-resources . each month the center 's 295 employees process 165,000 invoices , 15,000 travel expense reports , 44,000 checks , 77,000 payments , and 122,000 electronic transactions , reimbursements , and deposits . in addition , the center performs general-ledger and fixed-asset accounting and responds to customer-inquiries . as part of its overall-effort to reduce infrastructure-costs , the center also redesigned its organizational-structure using a selfdirected , teambased-approach . each of the fourto-eightperson-teams is responsible for a number of tasks , such as timecards , overtime , and discretionary-budget-management . the benefits of a team-concept include ownership of customer-problems , higher morale , and increased creativity/problem solving . 24 strategies to consider to maximize the efficiency of daytoday-accounting-activities , senior executives could : identify highvolume-processes or transactions that do not directly support the agency 's mission ( lowvalue , lowrisk ) and evaluate opportunities for • consolidating , standardizing , and reengineering transaction-processing and other routine-accounting-activities at a shared-service-center , initially by department and then across departments ;

( see practices 10 & 11 for information on attracting , retaining , and developing financial-professionals ) . 28 provide meaningful-information to decisionmakers financial information is meaningful when it is useful , relevant , timely , and reliable . however , many federal-agencies lack the systems and processes required to produce meaningful financial information needed for management-decisionmaking . for example , many agency financial and management-information-systems do not routinely provide adequate , timely-cost or performance-information needed to manage cost , measure-performance , make program-funding decisions , and analyze outsourcing or privatization-options . similarly , many private sector and state-organizations have struggled to overcome some of the same management-information issues that now face federal-agencies . over the past decade , global-competition and advances in information technology have changed information-requirements and users ' expectations regarding the availability and usefulness of financial information . financial information that , in the past , was considered adequate for decisionmaking is now considered overaggregated and too late to be useful . the leading-finance-organizations we visited enhanced their capabilities for providing meaningful-information to decisionmakers by developing-management information-systems that support the partnership between finance and operations , reengineering-processes in conjunction with implementing new technology , and translating financial-data into meaningful-information . practice 7 develop systems that support the partnership between finance and operations key-characteristics • the general-ledger-system is integrated into business-processes and is adequate for financial-reporting and control . • automated-system ( s ) are designed and deployed that ( 1 ) accurately measure the costs of activities , processes , products , and services and ( 2 ) provide line-managers with timely , accurate financial and nonfinancial-information on the quality and efficiency of business-processes and performance • an enterprisewide-system integrates operating , financial , and management-information and allows decisionmakers to access relevant-information easily and perform adhoc-data analysis . as federal-agencies develop plans for acquiring and installing financial-systems , the clingercohen-act of 1996 and related executive-branch-guidance will provide a framework for designing and deploying-information-technology . the clingercohen-act requires agencies to better link their information-technology-planning and investment-decisions to program-missions and goals . if implemented effectively , this legislation will provide a foundation that will help federal-agencies improve the interoperability of financial , operating , and management-systems . the leading-finance-organizations we visited have long had general-ledger-systems capable of generating auditable financial statements efficiently and routinely , thereby providing-information on stewardship and accountability at a high level . further , they historically have had adequate-systems for measuring and managing cost and performance . however , over the last decade new technology has made it possible for these organizations to integrate these systems and provide more relevant , accessible-information that meets the changing-needs of decisionmakers . many leading-organizations have already implemented , or are in the process of implementing an enterprisewide-system to integrate financial and operating-data to support both management-decisionmaking and external-reporting-requirements . some abandoned their legacy-systems all together and turned to stateoftheart integrated architectures , while others used wellfunctioning-legacy-systems and tied them together with a data-warehouse . regardless of the approach , these systems provided financial-analysts , accountants , and business unit-managers access to the same cost , performance , and profitability-information . similarly , the cfo council , jfmip , omb , treasury , and individual-agencies are working to improve the integration of budget , accounting , and program-information and systems . to support this process , a program-management office was recently established to develop financial-systems-requirements , address-system-integration issues , and generally facilitate the system-selection and procurement-process . this and other measures are important to ensure that federal-systems provide meaningful-information for managing and measuring-cost and performance as well as preparing external financial-reports . 30 strategies to consider to develop systems that support the partnership between finance and operations senior executives could : • acquire and install a general-ledger-system adequate for external financial-reporting-purposes . • develop managerially relevant cost-information systems and strategic performance-management-systems that access-data from financial-transaction-systems and relevant-operating systems . • integrate the agency 's financial ( including budgetary ) , operating , and management-systems and equip decisionmakers with the tools to easily access relevant-information and perform adhoc analyses . • ensure that financial-systems comply with federal financial-management-systems requirements , federal-accounting-standards , and the u.s. government standard general-ledger by • establishing the goal of using a single-general-ledger chart of accounts ( the u.s. government standard general-ledger ) and • developing an interim-approach to convert general-ledger accounts not consistent with the u.s. government standard general-ledger . this approach should use automated-crosswalks performed by those business-segments responsible for the data . 32 practice 8 reengineer-processes in conjunction with implementing new technology key-characteristics • commercial-offtheshelf software packages implemented with limited-modification . • processes and controls adapted to fit commercial-offtheshelf software . • processes are reengineered across functional-lines . at many of the leading-finance-organizations we visited , the vast majority of financial-applications were commercial-offtheshelf ( cots ) packages that were implemented with limited-modification to the basic-application-package itself . the advantages of using-cots software include ( 1 ) cots software is less costly than developing inhouse-applications , ( 2 ) software-upgrades are affordable and are regularly-available , and ( 3 ) cots software is designed to include best-practices . the key to successfully-implementing cots systems and best practice-processes , according to leading-finance-organizations , is reengineering-business-processes to fit the new software-applications . in fact , productivity-gains typically result from more efficient-processes , not from simply automating old ones . effectively reengineering-business-processes , however , requires moving from a functionalbased-organization to a processbased organization . for example , the procurement-process in a processbased federal-organization would start when a solicitation is issued , continue through contract-award and signature , as well as the issuance of purchase/work orders and receipt of goods , and end when the vendor properly received payment . the business-processes would be designed to maximize the efficiency and accuracy of the entire-process . the clingercohen-act contains provisions requiring federal-agencies to modernize inefficient administrative and missionrelated-work processes before making significant-technology-investments to support them . as a result , federal-agencies are beginning to consider the merits of information-technology-approaches that involve reengineering-business-processes in conjunction with implementing cots software without significant-modification . according to a report by the financial-systems committee of the cfo council , most agencies favor an approach that uses cots software for core financial-systems and other financial-management applications . however , agency-efforts to use cots products have been hampered by the government 's failure to communicate requirements and functionality effectively to the vendors and a proclivity on the part of agencies to modify software to meet existing-business-processes and to replicate previous-system functionality . to encourage the use of cots , omb and jfmip are working to improve ( 1 ) the testing and certification of cots systems , ( 2 ) existing-procurement-schedules , and ( 3 ) processes to obtain cots systems . case-study reengineering-core-business processes across functional-lines is the key to successful-cots-implementation when implementing its new financial-management-system rather than fitting new technology to outofdate processes , owens corning redesigned its business-processes to fit the new technology . the objective was to improve customer service and , at the same time , cut logistical-costs related to various-business-processes . to achieve these objectives owens corning formed crossfunctional process-improvement-teams for each major-business-process to improve or replace longstanding and often ineffective-business processes . during this effort , the improvement-teams used many common reengineering-tools , such as process-mapping and process-modeling . however , successfully reengineering its business-processes had more to do with the parameters owens corning placed on its process-improvement-teams . for example , the teams were given compressed schedules for completing `` as is '' modeling to prevent overanalysis and to force decisions . documenting current-processes should be accomplished in a matter of a week or two . the bulk of time should be spent on defining-user-requirements and designing new processes . another important-aspect of owens corning-process-improvement effort was its use of a process-reengineering management council . the council was made up of key-process and business-unit-executives that acted as arbitrators when conflicts developed . by reengineering-business-processes in conjunction with implementing new technology , owens corning increased its ability to meet customer-needs . in the past , for example , many of the company 's computers were not linked , making it impossible for sales-people to check on the availability of products or address-problems on a customer-invoice . now , all activities that occur from the time a customer places an order to the time owens corning receives payment are part of the customer-fulfillment-process . in addition , new technology has integrated functions related to the customer-fulfillment-process , such as sales , ordering , production , shipping , billing , and accounts receivable , providing-users with greater access to data . as a result , owens corning 's salesforce not only has access to uptodate information , but more efficient-processes allow sales-staff to respond immediately to customer-inquiries , instead of handing the problem off to another department . other outcomes related to process-improvement included ( 1 ) reducing the time it takes to close the books from 13 days to 5 dayswith a target of 1 day , ( 2 ) reducing the chart of accounts from 2,400 to 900 , and ( 3 ) standardizing-reporting , which allows comparisons to be made between operating-divisions . 34 strategies to consider to reengineer-processes that support new technology , senior executives could : • form crossfunctional-teams to ( 1 ) examine existing-core business-processes and ( 2 ) define user-requirements . • compare cots products against the agency 's requirements and identify the cots packages that most closely match the agency's needs . • reevaluate-user-requirements not supported by cots software and determine , before customizing-software , whether each requirement is still valid or whether alternatives exist that may be more costeffective . • where software-modifications are required , implement an effective configuration-management system that includes ( 1 ) clearly defining and assessing the effects of modifications on future product-upgrades before the modification is approved , ( 2 ) clearly documenting-software-products that are placed under configuration-management , and ( 3 ) maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system-life-cycle . • implement a quality-assurance-process that ensures that project-activities and software-products adhere to management's established plans , standards , and procedures . this includes ensuring that the configuration-management-process is effectively implemented and that product-changes are clearly documented and tested before being placed into production . • implement an effective risk management strategy to ensure that project-risks , such as customization and vendor 's ability to deliver a given system , are adequately identified and effective mitigation-strategies are implemented . key-characteristics translate financial-data • reports are designed around key drivers into meaningful-information such as markets , products , and customers . • relevant financial information is presented in an understandable , simple-format with suitable-amounts of detail and explanation . while new technology has made financial-data more available , without the ability to translate that data into relevant , understandable-information , decisionmakers are left powerless . traditionally , finance-organizations have used voluminous-paper reports , based primarily on the prior-month 's activity , to communicate financial information . further , management-reports were often designed around current organizational-structures . consequently , as organizational-structures changed over time , many management-reports became irrelevant . today , leading-finance-organizations have eliminated , reduced , and/or redesigned much of their old management-reporting-formats to better meet the needs of the user . these organizations have designed new reporting-formats around key-business-drivers rather than organizational-structures to provide executives and managers with relevant , forwardlooking-information on business unit performance . during this process , one company we visited actually stopped distributing selected-management-reports to determine whether anyone would miss them . they used the subsequent-lack of reaction as an indicator that the information in the report was no longer relevant . further , standardized-reports are designed to present information that is analyzed to bring out pertinent and fundamental points with suitable-amounts of detail and explanation . for example , owens corning 's executives and managers access a standardized monthly financial-report via the company 's internal area-network . the report 's executive-summary is 10 pages long and contains executivelevel-reporting , forecasting , and budgeting information . however , multiple-levels of detail are available , and decisionmakers can drill down to the desired level of detail . similarly , efforts are currently-underway across government to develop a meaningful , userfriendly-accountability-report on individual-departments and agencies . these reports consolidate and integrate audited financial statements and reporting under the results act and other related-laws to ( 1 ) show the degree to which an agency met its goals and at what cost and ( 2 ) aid the reader in determining whether the agency was well run . 36 strategies to consider to improve management-reporting of financial information , senior-finance-executives , as part of the top-management-team , could : • meet with key-policymakers and managers on an ongoing-basis to define key-business-drivers and determine what key-business information is needed for management and oversight of the agency 's mission and objectives . • determine what information is needed by program executives and managers to meet and support key-business information-requirements . • present various-reporting-format and content-options to executives , managers , and congressional-committees . 38 build a finance-team that delivers results as the finance-function has evolved over the past decade , from a paperdriven , labor intensive , clerical-role to a more consultative role as advisor , analyst , and business-partner , many leading-finance-organizations have seen a corresponding-shift in the mix of skills and competencies required to perform this new role . to respond to these changing-business-needs , the leading-organizations we visited developed finance-teams with the right-mix of skills and competencies and built finance-organizations that attract and retain talent as part of an overall strategic-approach to human-capital-planning . similarly , the cfo act , gmra , and gpra have placed new demands on federal-finance-organizations . accordingly , federal-agencies need to reassess their human-capital-practices to ensure that federal financial-professionals are equipped to meet these new challenges and support their agencies ' mission and goals . this executive-guide , along with our 1998 report on the training and qualifications of key financial-management-personnel and our 1999 human-capital selfassessment checklist,9 can provide a framework to strengthen the qualifications , skills , and competencies of federal financial-management personnel.10 vision : to be a valuecreating , customerfocused-partner in business-results 9 human-capital : a

strategic-humancapital-planning and is used as a foundation for all humancapital-management-activities and decisions . • training and career-development-programs use both classroom-instruction and rotational-assignments . • opportunities to `` learn the business '' are provided . at leading-finance-organizations , developing a finance-team with the right-mix of skills and competencies starts by defining a set of skills and competencies that will enable the finance-team to meet the current and future technical , management , and leadership needs of the business . the resulting competency-profile is used to assess gaps in individual or group competency-levels and develop human-capital-strategies to address current or expected future deficiencies . in this practice we discuss the training , career development , and successionplanning-strategies leading-finance-organizations use to develop a team with the right-mix of skills and competencies . the training and career-development-programs of the leading-finance-organizations we visited provided intensive 2to 3year-entry level-programs as well as midcareer and executivelevel-programs that used both classroom-instruction and rotational-assignments to develop technical , management , and leadership-skills and competencies . the programs ' course-work focuses initially on the tools and techniques of advanced-accounting and finance as well as general-business-skills . then , the focus shifts to the strategic application of these tools within businessspecific-environments . however , the key to implementing a successful-career-development program is to complement course-work with reallife-business experience through the use of planned rotational-assignments . the leading-finance-organizations we visited provided-opportunities for staff to rotate through various-positions throughout the finance-organization as well as the operating-divisions . such opportunities are critical not only in developing-employees that understand the whole-business and , in turn , provide greater value to their customers in the operating-divisions but also as a way of ensuring that an adequate-supply of wellprepared financial-professionals is available to fill key-positions . similarly , federal-finance-organizations are recognizing the need to provide a broad-range of experience to its financial-professionals . for example , as a way to develop a cadre of experienced and diverse-leaders , the cfo council fellows-program was initiated in april of 1998 with the selection of nine fellows to serve 1year-appointments at host-organizations . 40 strategies to consider to develop a team with the right-mix of skills and competencies , senior executives could : • as a part of an agencywide strategic-approach to human-capital-planning ( 1 ) determine the leadership , management , and functional/technical competencies required for the finance-organization to support agency-missions , goals , and objectives , ( 2 ) evaluate the finance-organization 's current and future-human capital-capabilities , ( 3 ) identify skill-gaps , ( 4 ) develop human-capital-policies and practices that will allow agencies to fill the identified skill-gaps , and ( 5 ) evaluate these efforts and use-performance data to continually update human-capital-strategies . • as a first step , assess the finance-organization 's human-capital-policies , programs and practices to determine whether they support the organization 's mission and vision for the future . ( see gao 's human-capital selfassessment checklist.11 ) • using both classroom-training , planned-staff rotations , and interagency-assignments , design a career-development-program geared toward • improving-leadership , management , and traditional financial-management-competencies , including the analytical-skills needed to support program-decisionmaking ; • understanding how reform-legislation ( e.g. , cfo act , gmra , ffmia , gpra ) will affect the finance-organization 's roles , responsibilities , and processes within the context of specific-agency-operations ; and • understanding overall-agency-operations , including program-implications of financial-decisions . • establish continuing professional-education-requirements for financial-managers similar to those required for auditors . 11 human-capital : a self-assessment-checklist for agency-leaders ( gao/ggd99179 , september 1999 ) . 42 practice 11 build a finance-organization that attracts and retains talent key-characteristics • top financial-leadership participates in the recruitment of new talent . • a variety of clear career-path-opportunities are offered and staff-development-programs are used as a means of exposing staff to different-career-opportunities . • competitive-compensation and benefits-packages are available . as discussed in practice 10 , sound-training and career development-strategies are needed for the finance-organization to meet the current and future-human capital needs of the business . equally-important , however , are recruitment , retention , and reward strategies that enable the finance-organization to attract and retain talented financial-professionals at all levels . although their styles and strategies varied , the leading-organizations we visited agreed that several key-factors were important in attracting and retaining-talent . first , recruiting a talented-workforce requires the commitment of top-leadership . the cfos at these organizations are often heavily involved talent-assessment and senior-executive-leaders are actively involved in oncampus-recruiting . this sends a powerful message to potential new recruits that the position is important enough to the organization that it warrants senior-executive attention . second , attracting and ultimately keeping a highly-qualified and motivated-workforce involves providing meaningful-career opportunities , such as the opportunity to ( 1 ) participate in exciting-groundbreaking-projects , ( 2 ) build a portfolio of new skills , and ( 3 ) choose a variety of career-paths . these organizations often used their staff-development-programs to provide these opportunities . for example , as discussed in practice 10 , career-development-programs often include rotational-assignments and not only provide excellent-growth-opportunities but also expose staff to a variety of career-path-opportunities . third , compensation is a key-factor in any career-decision . while , according to employee-compensation-surveys , compensation is fairly-comparable between the private and public-sectors for entry level and middle-management-positions , executive-compensation in the private sector far exceeds that of federal-executives , thereby limiting federal-agencies ' ability to attract and retain federal-executives . ( see appendix iv for compensation-survey-results . ) however , other factors such as the desire to effect-change and make a difference may attract senior executives to public-service . in addition , opportunities may exist that will enhance agencies' ability to attract and retain talent at all levels . for example , the revolutionary-changes that are taking place as a result of the cfo and results-acts provide an ideal-occasion to revamp the opportunities available to federal financial-professionals and to market the possibilities offered by a career in federal financial-management . strategies to consider to build an organization that attracts and retains talent , the cfo and senior executives could : • actively work with colleges and universities to ( 1 ) market the opportunities available for financial-professionals and ( 2 ) include a federal-accounting and financial-management curriculum that will not only prepare students for careers in federal-accounting but will also help promote federal-career possibilities . • continue to work with the office of personnel-management to provide more flexible-career-paths that provide opportunities for movement throughout the finance-organization and agency-program offices . • utilize staff-development-programs and planned-staff rotations to expose financial-managers and staff to a variety of career-paths . appendix i research-objectives , scope , and methodology the objectives of our research were to ( 1 ) define and describe the characteristics of a worldclass-finance-organization , ( 2 ) identify the factors that are essential for finance-organizations to improve their financial-management and move towards worldclass standards , and ( 3 ) provide case-studies which illustrate the efforts of leading-finance-organizations from private-sector-companies and state-governments to improve their financial-management and the overall-performance of their organizations . we formed an advisory-group to assist with job-design , our overall-scope and methodology , and case-study-selection as well as to critique our research-findings and comment on our draft-report . the group consisted of private-sector-executives , state and local comptrollers , academicians , and other experts and consultants outside the federal government . ( key-contacts and project-advisors are listed in appendix vii . ) we also consulted with members of various cfo council committees and representatives from omb and treasury . to meet our research-objectives , we performed an extensive-literature search on the subject of financial-management best-practices using commercial best practice-databases , the internet , prior gao reports , trade-journals and magazines , federal-guidelines , private-sector-studies , and other resources . we synthesized and analyzed the numerous-documents acquired from our literature-search and case-study-organizations to determine the objectives essential for organizations to improve their financial-management . based on consultations with our advisory-group and our case-study-entities , we consolidated and refined the factors to those presented in this guide . we selected six private-sector-companies and three state-governments to serve as our case-studies . we selected the private-sector-companies based on ( 1 ) recognition for outstanding financial-management-practices and/or successful financial-reengineering efforts , ( 2 ) size and complexity comparable to federal-government-agencies , and ( 3 ) discussions with members of our advisory-group . we selected the state-governments based on ( 1 ) the 1995 `` the state of the states '' report issued by financial world magazine and ( 2 ) discussions with members of our advisory-group and the cfo council . we interviewed various-officials , including-chief financial-officers , chief-information-officers , business-unit-executives , state-executive and legislative-branch-officials , treasurers , controllers , internal-auditors , agency-administrators , and human resource-specialists . we also reviewed various-company-documents , including-vision-statements , strategic-plans , core-competencies for finance-personnel , training and development-guides , key financial-reports , performance-metrics , and other documents related to reengineering-efforts of the finance-organization . we asked-officials at the private-sector-companies and state-governments profiled in the case-studies to verify the accuracy of the information presented on their respective-organizations and incorporated their comments as appropriate ; however , we did not independently verify the accuracy of that information . in addition , we provided a draft of this entire-guide to omb , members of the cfo council , and our advisory-group for their review and comment . 46 appendix
