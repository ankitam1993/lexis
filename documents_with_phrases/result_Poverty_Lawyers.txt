poverty-lawyers poorer than ever ? disparity in salaries far greater now by thomas adcock new york law journal march 8 , 2002 it was hardly the most enlightened of times , not with the '' conflict in indochina '' rapidly becoming america 's costliest and most divisive-war . yet simultaneously , there was the social-activism of the warren court , and a national-administration moved to declare a more worthy campaign in 1964 : the war on poverty . it was a time when progressive young-lawyers began a long struggle - not yet won - for the right of all poor-people to free and effective legal-counsel . they are today 's `` grayheads '' of the poverty-law-bench , as the new generation of public-service-lawyers affectionately call them - a generation whose idealism comes at a far steeper price , at least on the surface . daniel l. greenberg remembers a negligible-difference in the average annual starting-pay for poverty-lawyers and their counterparts at big manhattan firms : $ 6,500 and $ 7,500 , respectively . the year was 1969 , said mr. greenberg , president and attorney in chief of the legal-aid society of new york . `` that year , one firm doubled the starting-salary , and then the others quickly followed-suit , '' said mr. greenberg . `` in part , the firms were saying that they were losing the best and the brightest , to use the phrase of the time , to the emerging new legal-services . '' nowadays , a poverty-lawyer working for one of new york 's many agencies representing the indigent - including legal-aid , the south brooklyn legal-services , the lawyers alliance for new york , inmotion , the lawyers committee for human rights , volunteers of legal-service , the bronx defenders and new york lawyers for the public-interest - might begin his or her career at $ 32,000 per annum , compared with the $ 125,000 average first-year associate salary at the city 's larger firms . which is not to say that youthful-idealism collapsed with the incredible-inflation of private-law-firm salaries . `` there are reasons why people do this work , it 's about larger things you believe in , '' said lynn vogelstein , a documentary filmmaker who is now a staff-attorney practicing-family-law at south brooklyn legal-services . as a filmmaker , she said , `` i was somewhat frustrated because the social-impact is very indirect . `` my cases present me with incredibly-interesting legal and intellectual-issues about the role of government in people 's lives , the responsibility the state has in our lives - the intrusion of the state into people 's lives . `` i 'm confronted by such issues every day , '' said ms. vogelstein , 36 , a 1997 graduate of new york university school of law . `` sometimes-people think you 're a do-gooder and making this big sacrifice , but the thing is - i get to practice at so many different-levels , which is something a lot of young-lawyers in private-practice do n't realize . '' katherine r. locker , 29 , knew her calling from childhood , growing up with a sister who suffered developmental-disabilities . ms. locker became a teacher , then later went to harvard law-school . today , she runs her own pilot-project within the juvenile rights division of legal-aid . `` families like mine need lawyers , even if they do n't have the means , '' said ms. locker , supervising-attorney for the kathryn a. mcdonald education advocacy project , named for the late administrator of the new york city family-courts . with the help of a paralegal and two staff-attorneys , her project has a broader vision of legal-advocacy . `` we spend a lot of time going to schools and negotiating , with the hope of resolving-problems before litigation . with the appropriate-services , people can surpass what 's expected of them . '' at age 48 , sean delany , executive director of lawyers alliance for new york , which provides business-services to non-profit-organizations , holds a perspective-midway between the grayheads and the new breed of poverty-lawyer . when he was at the university of virginia school of law in the late-1970s , mr. delany said , `` tuition was modest , $ 1,500 per semester . today , not only do law-school-graduates forego the opportunities of a large-salary , but they have these enormous tuition-debt-burdens . '' a graduate of a top-tier law-school may carry a debt-burden of as much as $ 100,000 . some schools , certainly not all , credit a portion of tuition-debt in return for public-law-service . and last august , the american bar-association created a commission on loan repayment and forgiveness to formulate ways to expand such credits beyond the relative-handful of schools offering such help - usually the more well-endowed-campuses such as nyu law , harvard law , columbia law-school and yale law-school . but no national-standard of debt-forgiveness is even near at hand , and the help that now exists does not mean that young-poverty lawyers do not worry about what they owe . `` i 'm in a huge , overwhelming-sea of debt , '' said jennifer arons , 28 , a criminal defense staff-attorney at manhattan legal-aid . `` so the money-thing 's tough . '' she chose nyu law over columbia specifically because nyu would cover more of her tuition . and she chose public-interest-law because otherwise , `` i would have been ostracized . my parents were marxists , and so were my grandparents . '' ms. arons and her office-mate - stephanie schwartz - make something of a political odd-couple at legal-aid . while ms. arons was a so-called red-diaper-baby , ms. schwartz 's mother is carol schwartz , a law-and-order republican on the council of the district of columbia . `` they try to see her as less of a republican , '' said ms. schwartz of her mother . `` my father was a corporate-lawyer , and he hated it . they 're both proud of my underdog-work . `` our [ criminal-justice ] system is scary . most who have to go through it are poor-people of color . i worked in a prosecutor's office one summer . i decided i could never be a prosecutor . '' like ms. locker , michael a. rothenberg of new york lawyers for the public-interest became `` hooked on trying to make a difference , '' as he put it , while growing up with a learning disabled sibling . `` i watched my parents-struggle to get my brother the services he needed , '' said mr. rothenberg , 37 , who is now executive director for new york lawyers . `` even with my father being a lawyer , it was tough . '' early in his public-law-career , as a staff-counsel for south brooklyn legal-services , mr. rothenberg worked as co-counsel with his father - stanley rothenberg , a partner at moses & singer llp . father and son made a successful-appeal before a social-security administrative-board on behalf a learning disabled client . `` my family was able to help me with school , '' said mr. rothenberg , a graduate of nyu law . `` so unlike the truly new generation , i was n't faced with the debt-burden . `` but public-service was n't-something i thought about , '' he said . `` i knew what i wanted to do , and money was n't the issue . '' issue of money for better or for worse , money can be an issue for young-public interest-lawyers - whether or not they have debts . `` can you really live on $ 32,500 in new york city ? '' mr. rothenberg asked . `` it's do-able , but it 's hard and there are sacrifices . i 'm looking at ways to raise salaries . '' john `` chip '' gray jr. , the project-director at south brooklyn legal-services , and at 59 a veteran of poverty-law , said he likes to find lawyers in private-practice willing to scale back . `` to cut your income by two-thirds or more , now that takes character , '' said mr. gray . `` we get them that way sometimes . `` i was n't much-interested in being a corporate-lawyer . my mother was a legal-aid-attorney in boston when i was growing up in the '50s , '' said mr. gray . `` your mother 's a big-influence on you . `` so it was an easy-decision for me . but there are a lot of people who have to fight their parents to do something like this , condemning themselves to limited-income . `` it takes real-commitment to the importance of the work , '' said mr. gray . `` which i find fascinating on a substantive legal-basis . '' all public-law-services depend on pro-bono-work by the private-firms , and nearly every new york firm contributes , especially in the wake of sept. 11 . `` we try to involve our lawyers in pro-bono right from the start of their careers , '' said christopher k. tahbaz , 37 , a partner at debevoise & plimpton . `` it 's an important part of what a lawyer in private-practice should be doing . '' lately , mr. gray and his fellow-grayheads have been discussing the question : with the increasing-disparity in salaries between public and private-law , is it more difficult to recruit and hire the kind of idealistic young-lawyers who seemed to be everywhere in the '60s ? for his part , mr. gray answered , `` no , i have n't noticed that .
