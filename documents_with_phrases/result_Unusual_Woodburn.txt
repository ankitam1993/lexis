unusual woodburn-office helps indigenous mexicans monday , october 28 , 2002 alex davis woodburn , ore. ( ap ) - the boss refuses to pay me . my wife and kids are sick and do n't speak english . we do n't understand the law about pesticides in the fields . for decades , oregon farmworkers have raised these issues in spanish . but what if the questions come in mixteco , triqui or zapotec ? a small legal-office in downtown-woodburn is offering an answer . the indigenous-project , a new program run by the oregon law center , is one of only a handful of places in the united states where indigenous-farmworkers from mexico and central america can find free and confidential legal-aid . the project aims to reach the growing number of people who are following the agricultural-migrant-stream to oregon but do n't share the language and culture of the spanish-speaking-farmworker majority . julie samples , a lawyer with the program , estimates the state's mexican indigenous-population at around 10,000 people , a dramatic-increase compared to a decade ago . most are from oaxaca , a state of rugged-mountains and extreme-poverty in southern mexico . samples , a 2001 graduate of lewis & clark law-school , spent the summer traveling to dozens of labor-camps throughout the willamette valley to talk with workers about their legal-rights . she says indigenous-farmworkers , driven north by economic-hardship , are more likely than spanish-speakers to be denied wages or forced into substandard-housing . most are mixtecs , a people familiar with injustice toward indians in their native-country . the bias continues in the united states , sometimes from the larger mexican-mainstream . `` most of them have never had a fair-shake from the outside world , '' said mark wilk , director of the oregon law center's woodburn-office . `` they 're not familiar with the mexican or u.s. legal-system . '' wilk says the indigenous-program is at the same point where legal-services were two decades ago for native spanish-speakers . the team 's office , in a heavily hispanic-area of downtown-woodburn , is a testament to the difficulty of reaching the indigenous-community . a sign on the front-door indicates the building is `` abierto , '' or open in spanish . a coffee-table inside is stacked with copies of el noticiero-legal , or the legal news . but few materials are available in mixteco or other indigenous-tongues , in part because they barely exist in written form . instead , samples is creating audio-cassettes of legal-information . she works with valentin sanchez , an oaxaca-native who speaks english , spanish and mixteco . they spend most of their time traveling to housing-camps - few workers own cars - and setting up presentations in schools and community-centers . the project was modeled after a similar-effort created in 1994 by california rural legal-assistance . irma luna , a community-worker with that program , said it 's not uncommon for indigenous-laborers to perform piecework for 10 hours a day and be paid $ 30 or less . studies in california show that most mixtecs follow the tomato , lettuce and chile-harvests from the central valley to the fruit and berry-harvests of oregon and washington . most are highly-mobile , young and male . language is often a major stumbling-block for recent-arrivals . there have been a handful of high-profile-cases in which indigenous-workers were charged with crimes in oregon and detained for lengthy-periods due to communication-barriers . in the early-1990s , a mixtec-worker named santiago ventura morales spent four years in an oregon prison before his murder conviction was overturned . several years later , a migrant-worker named adolfo-ruiz-alvarez was released from a state mental-hospital after two years of psychiatric-evaluations and drug-treatments . he had been charged with trespassing and public-indecency near mount angel , but didn't understand the interpreters who interviewed him in spanish . a native of oaxaca , he only spoke an indian-dialect called triqu i . the majority of the cases in woodburn-today are far simpler . common-issues range from wage-claims to poor working-conditions to sexual-harassment . most are settled with a phone-call or a letter threatening-litigation . sanchez , the indigenous-project 's tri-lingual-employee , said the number of mixtecs has grown considerably since he arrived in oregon in the late 1990s . he sees mixtecs playing-basketball , shopping in woodburn-grocery-stores and speaking his language on public telephones . a downtown-shop called `` el oaxaqueo '' offers a place where mixteco-speakers can find oaxacan-newspapers and beaded-jewelry made by indigenous-people . from behind the counter , employee david lopez , who is mixtec , can call out prices to customers in mixteco , spanish or english . `` i 'm working on my fourth-language now , '' said lopez , referring to his russian-classes at woodburn high school . some mixtec-immigrants also have formed native-groups , or hometown-associations , that send money-home for projects such as telephone-lines or street-paving . the informal-associations select members at random to return-home for periods of service - working as a volunteer-mayor , for example , or town-clerk . not all oaxacans classify themselves as indian . some trace their ancestry to the influence of spain . the state of oaxaca is the fourth most common-source of students for oregon public-schools , which suggests a growing-trend of indigenous-people moving here . the oregon law center is one of a few legal-groups that cater to farmworkers . the project is funded by a two-year , $ 80,000 fellowship from the nonprofit academy for educational development , along with grants of $ 37,500 each from the spirit mountain community fund and the campaign for equal-justice , and a grant of $ 12,500 from the pacificorp foundation for learning . the money goes toward language-resources , transportation and legal-research . it also provides a salary for samples , who speaks english and spanish , and sanchez , who also speaks mixteco . legal-aid-services of oregon runs a similar-office in woodburn next door to the indigenous-project , but is restricted in the clients it serves - usually-workers with legal-documents only - because it receives federal-funding . nargess-shadbeh , director of the oregon law center 's farmworker program , said the indigenous-project will continue into the future if more funding can be raised . the center has applied for several grants since the first fellowship was awarded to samples in august 2001 .
