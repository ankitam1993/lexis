( 8 fcc rcd 4958 ( 1993 ) , 58 fed . reg . 26692 ) . the commission later announced the formation of the hearing-aid-compatibility negotiated rulemaking-committee , an advisory-committee that would consider whether the rule-suspension should be lifted and whether new rules should be proposed . ( 59 fed . reg . 60343 , 58 fed . reg . 1539 , and 60 fed . reg . 27945 ) . the committee 's members included telephone equipment-manufacturers , employers , hospitals and nursing-homes , hotels and motels , persons with disabilities , and an fcc representative . the committee 's final-report , adopted by unanimous-consent , was filed with the fcc in august 1995 . ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis section 610 ( e ) of the hearing-aid-compatibility act of 1988 , 47 u.s.c . § 610 , requires the commission to consider the costs and benefits of proposed-rules to all telephone-users , including persons with and without hearing-disabilities . in the notice of proposed-rulemaking the commission solicited-comments on the costs to establishments of providing-volume-control and hearing-aid-compatibility . after reviewing the comments , the commission concluded that the $ .50 to $ 1.00 per unit-increase in manufacturing costs does not impose a significant additional-cost to users , especially considering the lengthy-phase-in-period for the requirements . it also concluded that any costs are significantly outweighed by the benefits to be achieved . gao/ogc-96-36 ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 section 603 : initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis the commission initiated this proceeding with a notice of proposed-rulemaking ( 11 fcc rcd 4338 ) that reflected the recommendations of the hearing-aid-compatibility negotiated rulemaking-committee . that notice was summarized in the federal register ( 60 fed . reg . 63667 ) . in the notice , the commission published an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis and invited written public-comments on the proposed-rulemaking , including-comments on the initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis . the analysis included in the proposed-rulemaking provides the information required by sections 603 ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , describing the reasons for the proposed action and its objectives and legal-basis . the information required by sections 603 ( b ) ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) concerning the estimate of the classes of small-entities-subject to the report and order and the projected reporting , recordkeeping and other compliance-requirements of the proposed-rulemaking is also included . in the analysis , the commission stated its belief that the proposed report and order does not duplicate , overlap , or conflict with any other relevant federal-rules in accordance with the provisions of section 603 ( b ) ( 5 ) . the initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis did not discuss any significant-alternatives minimizing the impact on small-entities . section 604 : final regulatory-flexibility-analysis the supplementary-information published in the federal register includes the full-text of the commission 's final regulatory-flexibility-analysis . 61 fed . reg . 42181 . that analysis includes information required by section 604 , including a description of the need for and purpose of this report and order . although no comments were submitted in direct-response to the initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis , the commission noted that a number of the general-comments on the notice of proposed-rulemaking raised-issues that could affect small-entities . in response to comments , the commission extended the compliance deadline for volume-control from 1 year to 2 years and for hac labelling of telephones by 6 months . the analysis describes and estimates the number of small-entities affected by the report and order , addressing separately workplaces , confined settings such as hospitals and nursing-homes , hotels and motels , and importers and manufacturers page 2 gao/ogc-96-36 of telephones for use in the united states . the analysis also discusses the projected reporting , recordkeeping and other compliance-requirements of the report and order . finally , the commission considered two significant-alternatives that could minimize the impact on small businesses : ( 1 ) not including within the purview of `` telephones provided for emergency-use '' those telephones in workplace noncommon-areas , in confined settings and in hotels and motels and ( 2 ) not requiring-volume controls on the covered telephones . the commission stated that it rejected both alternatives because both seriously decreased the ability of hearing- impaired individuals to gain access to phones in emergency-situations . commission officials confirmed that copies of both the initial and the final regulatory-flexibility-analyses were submitted to the chief-counsel , small business-administration . section 609 : participation by small-entities the report and order , in large part , adopts the unanimous recommendations of the hearing-aid-compatibility negotiated rulemaking-committee , an advisory-committee established by the federal communications commission in 1995 . according to the commission , the committee 's membership included small businesses and associations representing both large and small businesses as well as a telecommunication-association representing-end-users , some of whom are small-entities . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 as an independent regulatory-agency , the commission is not subject to title ii of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the commission promulgated this rule under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . a notice of proposed-rulemaking was released on november 28 , 1995 ( 11 fcc rcd 4338 ) . a summary of the notice was published in the federal register ( 60 fed . reg . 63667 ) . in response to the notice , 31 parties filed comments , 45 parties filed informal-comment-letters , and 6 parties filed reply comments . appendix a to the report and order lists the parties filing-comments and reply comments . the report and order provides a discussion of these comments and commission reaction to them . page 3 gao/ogc-96-36 paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the notice of proposed-rulemaking solicited-public comment on specific-aspects of the collections and was submitted to omb for review-pursuant to 44 u.s.c . § 3507 ( d ) ( 1 ) . omb assigned control-number 3060-0687 to the collection and approved several of the proposals while filing-comment on one of the proposed requirements . the notice of proposed-rulemaking discussed three requirements subject to the paperwork reduction act of 1995 . first , the item proposed that importers and manufacturers of new telephones for use in the united states be required to stamp the date of manufacture on new telephones . under current-rules , the date of manufacture is optional . the commission stated that a date-stamp on a telephone would indicate to users that a telephone is hearing-aid compatible if it were imported or manufactured after august 16 , 1989 , when all new telephones were required to be hearing-aid compatible . second , until the rules for all workplace-telephones go into effect , the commission proposed that employers designate certain-hearing-aid compatible-telephones for emergency-use . third , the commission proposed to amend a commission rule regarding-packaging to clarify that the type of hearing-aid-compatibility referred to is electro-magnetic-coil-compatibility . as a result of comments from groups representing-persons with hearing-disabilities and the office of management and budget , the commission modified its date-stamp-proposal in the report and order . instead of requiring a date-stamp , the report and order required that new telephones be stamped with the letters `` hac . '' commenters stated that a date-stamp would be meaningless to many installers and users , but that a letter-stamp would be much more informative . the commission also changed the effective-date of the letter stamping-requirement from the effective-date of the report and order to april 1 , 1997 , to give importers and manufacturers time to make equipment-changes . the commission also confirmed , in its report and order , its proposal to require employers to designate emergency-use-telephones until the new hearing-aid-compatibility rules are implemented . the commission rejected-suggestions to issue specific-signage requirements , saying that the requirement that employers designate the telephones was sufficient . the commission also amended its rule regarding-packaging to clarify the type of hearing-aid-compatibility to which the rule refers . the final-requirements were submitted to omb on july 23 , 1996 , pursuant to 44 u.s.c . § 3507 ( d ) ( 2 ) for approval . the report and order is effective october 23 , 1996 , 70 days after the august 14 , 1996 , publication of the report and order in the federal register . page 4 gao/ogc-96-36 statutory-authorization for the rule the commission has promulgated this rule-pursuant to provisions of the hearing-aid-compatibility act of 1988 ( 47 u.s.c . § 610 ) . the commission did not identify any other statutes or executive-orders imposing-requirements relevant to this report and order . page 5 gao/ogc-96-36
