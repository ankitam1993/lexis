'' the commission solicited written comments from the public and held two public-hearings duly noticed in the federal register . the report of the commission is based on a thorough-analysis of the applicable-statutory-provisions , the extensive-record compiled from the comments and testimony regarding the circumstances under which representation of eligible-aliens occurs and the practices of legal-services grantees relating to eligible-aliens . scope of alien-representation . corporation grantees are permitted to represent several-classes of aliens , including lawful permanent-aliens , refugees , persons granted asylum , and temporary agricultural-workers admitted under the `` h-2a '' program . with the sole-exception of h-2a workers , lsc grantees may provide representation to aliens on the same subjects as is provided to citizens . ( the report refers to these classes as `` unrestricted-categories . '' ) the representation of h-2a workers , however , is limited to `` matters which arise under the provisions of the worker 's specific-employment-contract '' in the areas of wages , housing , transportation and other employment-rights under the contract . the `` present in the united states '' requirement applies to both the unrestricted-categories and h-2a workers . of particular-interest to the commission was the situation of seasonal agricultural-workers , a category that includes both aliens from the unrestricted-categories ( such as permanent-resident-aliens ) and h-2a workers . seasonal agricultural-workers frequently leave and re-enter the united states ; thus the `` presence '' requirement would have a substantial and direct-impact on their ability to receive legal-representation from lsc grantees . the record reveals that it has been a long-standing-practice for lsc grantees to provide legal-assistance to eligible-aliens who have left the united states at some point during representation . this practice has been followed without objection from the corporation when conducting-audits of lsc grantees , or from agricultural-employers and growers-associations involved in legal disputes . in addition , there has been no formal-regulation or opinion of the general counsel 's office regarding the specific scope of the presence-requirement . a recent-complaint to the corporation about the activities of a sub-grantee relating to alien-representation raised the issue presented to the commission . statutory-analysis . applying the principles of law-governing statutory-analysis , the commission considered the presence-requirement in light of its plain and ordinary-meaning , its context in a statutory-scheme and the purpose and design of the statute as a whole . see part iii ( a ) . the corporation 's appropriations-act requires that an alien must be `` present in the united states '' in order to be eligible for legal-assistance . construing the term '' present '' according to its ordinary-meaning , it is clear that the statute requires the alien to be physically-present in the united states at some point . this conclusion does not end the inquiry , however , because the relevant-question is not whether an alien must be physically-present in the united states , but when the alien must be present in order to be entitled to lsc representation . here , the language provides no express-statement on when an alien must be present in the united states . indeed , no single-interpretation is clearly compelled by the statutory-language . for example , nothing in the lsc authorization language keys representation to when the cause of action arises or specifically requires that the alien be present when the representation commences . in particular , the statute does not expressly require that an alien be continuously physically-present in the united states throughout the period of representation in order to be eligible for legal-assistance . the factual-record and the statutory-scheme in which the language arises , on the other hand , provide an important-context for consideration of the legal-question of when an alien must be '' present in the united states . '' consideration of the immediate-context in which the language appears raises further questions regarding the meaning of the presence-requirement . the statute's application of the presence-requirement to legal permanent-residents , for example , is in some tension with the fact that those aliens are legally entitled to leave the united states temporarily without affecting their immigration-status . see part ii ( c ) ( 1 ) . furthermore , h-2a workers by definition are physically-present in the united states only temporarily . reading `` presence '' in the statute to require uninterrupted , continuous physical-presence would mean that congress , without using such language , intended to deny lsc representation to aliens who engaged in federally-authorized-travel that did not affect their immigration-status . in the case of h-2a workers , the reading would require the conclusion that congress intended to provide h-2a workers with legal-services-representation on claims arising from their employment-contracts only for the very brief-periods that the workers are in the united states -- potentially rendering the promise of legal-representation largely-meaningless . in short , an examination of the language of the presence-requirement and the statutory-context in which it arises raises a number of interpretive-problems and fails to resolve the question of when an alien must be present in the united states in order to be entitled to legal-services-representation . the commission concludes that the statutory-language is ambiguous on this point . these difficulties support further inquiry into relevant legislative-history to help determine the meaning of the presence-requirement . legislative-history . the legislative-history of the presence-requirement in the corporation 's appropriations and the applicable h-2a provisions in the immigration reform and control act confirm that congress intended to provide meaningful-representation to eligible-aliens , including h-2a workers on claims arising from their employment-contract ; and that congress did not understand the presence-requirement to severely alter or restrict this representation . see part iii ( b ) . the legal-services act was adopted to provide effective legal-representation to low-income-persons . the presence-language appeared in the lsc appropriations-act as part of an effort to expand lsc representation to aliens other than lawful-residents , and does not appear to have been intended to limit lsc representation to aliens who were continuously physically-present in the united states . similarly , the express-purpose of section 305 of irca was to `` secure the rights of h-2 agricultural-workers under the specific-contract under which they were admitted to this country . '' such representation was intended to prevent the exploitation of foreign h2a workers and to ensure that the wages and working-conditions of u.s. workers would not be undermined . findings of fact and application of law . the record compiled by the commission supports , inter-alia , the following-findings of fact . see part ii . aliens in the unrestricted-categories often legally leave the country during the course of their representation . see part ii ( c ) ( 1 ) . most h-2a workers are in the united states for brief-periods of time and do not seek legal-representation until they have completed their contract , often because of fear of retaliation by the growers . see part ii ( c ) ( 2 ) and ( d ) ( 1 ) . most claims made by aliens take years to resolve . see part ii ( e ) . requiring legal-services-attorneys to monitor their clients ' movements and formally withdraw whenever the client-leaves the country would create extraordinary-burdens for the lsc grantees , the clients , opposing-parties , and the courts . see part ii ( g ) . finally , the private-bar and other nonprofit legal-services-providers are neither-available , willing , nor able to take over the representation of these populations . see part ii ( f ) . this factual-record provided an important-context for consideration of the legal-question of the meaning of the presence-requirement . three possible-interpretations of the presence-language were listed in the corporation 's federal register notice : ( 1 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal-assistance arises ; ( 2 ) an alien must be physically-present only when legal-representation is commenced ; and ( 3 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states any time the alien is provided legal-assistance from an lsc grantee . upon careful-consideration of the findings of fact , the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative-history , the commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of congress . furthermore , the record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered by the corporation in the federal register notice would contradict congress ' clear-purpose of providing meaningful legal-representation to indigent lawful-aliens and lead to absurd-results . see part iii ( c ) . for example , as applied to the unrestricted-aliens , such interpretations would preclude representation for permanent-resident-aliens who are evicted from their apartments or against whom divorce-proceedings were commenced while the alien is legally out of the country for brief-periods to attend a family-emergency or funeral . these interpretations would also invite exploitation by allowing-litigants to simply wait until an alien temporarily departed the united states before cutting off workers-compensation-benefits , or initiating-eviction , repossession , or divorce or custody-proceedings . in regard to h-2a workers , the record demonstrates that congress ' purpose of providing meaningful-representation to these workers can not be accomplished under the three interpretations in the federal register . many of the contract-rights of such workers -- such as reimbursement for return-transportation , workers-compensation , the 3/4 guarantee , and claims that a grower failed to mail the worker 's final-paycheck -- often do not arise until after the worker has returned home . in addition , if the worker is required to be in the united states throughout the course of the representation , the right to legal-assistance would be lost altogether . by law , h-2a workers must leave the country at the end of their contract-period and most such workers are in the united states for only two to five months . the factual-record before the commission demonstrates that the vast majority of the claims of h-2a workers can not be completed while the alien is in the united states . the commission recognizes that representation of agricultural-workers was a central-element in the legislative-crafting of the h-2a program . the commission concludes that this reading of the statute would essentially bar lsc representation of this class of aliens and leave h-2a workers without meaningful-representation on their employment-contract-claims , directly-contrary to congress ' express-purpose . we decline to sanction such a result . conclusion . together , the language , purpose , and legislative-history of the applicable-statutes , and the factual-record before the commission , suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the following-representation : for an alien in one of the unrestricted-categories representation would be authorized so long as the eligible-alien is present sufficient to maintain residence or lawful-immigration-status . under this interpretation , lsc grantees who have begun representation of a permanent-resident-alien may continue that representation should the alien be temporarily outside the united states . grantees may also initiate representation of aliens in the unrestricted-categories who are temporarily outside the united states , provided that they have been present sufficient to maintain and have not abandoned their residence or ina status . lsc grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the united states . for h-2a workers , representation is authorized if the workers have been admitted to and have been present in the united states pursuant to an h-2a contract , and the representation arises under their h-2a contract . lsc grantees are authorized to litigate this narrow-range of claims to completion , despite the fact that the alien may be required to depart the united states prior to or during the course of the representation . lsc grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the united states . i . introduction the erlenborn commission was established to evaluate the scope of permissible-representation for eligible-aliens by lsc grantees . since 1983 , the corporation 's appropriations-act and its regulation on the representation of aliens have required that an alien be '' present in the united states '' to be eligible for legal-assistance from an lsc grantee . neither the appropriations-act nor the corporation 's regulations defines the term `` present in the united states . '' the legal-services corporation board of directors adopted resolution 98-011 , on november 16 , 1998 , providing-authority to establish the commission with the express-purpose of studying the presence-requirement for the representation of eligible-aliens . lsc grantees are permitted to represent several-classes of aliens , including lawful permanent-aliens , refugees , persons granted asylum , and temporary agricultural-workers admitted under the `` h-2a '' program.1 with the sole-exception of h-2a workers , lsc grantees may provide general-representation to aliens on all the same subjects as is provided to citizens . ( these classes will be referred to as `` unrestricted-categories . '' ) the representation of h-2a workers , however , is limited to matters which arise under the worker 's specific-employment-contract in the areas of wages , housing , transportation and other employment-rights . the `` present in the united states '' requirement applies to both the unrestricted-categories and to h-2a workers . the commission has gathered an extensive factual-record . the commission solicited-comments from the public through a notice duly published in the federal register . 64 fed . reg . 8140 ( 1999 ) . the commission sought public-comments on the facts and circumstances surrounding the representation of all eligible-aliens who are affected by the presence-requirement . it placed particular-emphasis on seasonal 2 agricultural-workers -- which includes temporary h-2a workers as well as aliens from the unrestricted 3 categories such as permanent-resident-aliens and special agricultural-workers ( saws ) . the federal register notice asked that comments be directed to the following-questions : ( 1 ) how long are seasonal agricultural-workers typically in the united states ? 1 the program 's name is derived from the subparagraph of the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) that defines the status , 8 u.s.c . § 1101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( h ) ( ii ) ( a ) ( 1994 ) ( an alien `` having residence in a foreign-country which he has no intention of abandoning who is coming temporarily to the united states to perform agricultural-labor or services . . . of a temporary or seasonal-nature '' ) . 2 see 8 u.s.c . § 1160 ( h ) ( 1994 ) . seasonal agricultural-work is defined in the ina as : `` the performance of field-work related to planting , cultural-practices , cultivating , growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables of every kind and other perishable commodities , as defined in regulations by the secretary of agriculture . '' id . 3 see 8 u.s.c . § 1160 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( 1994 ) . an alien is eligible for classification as a special agricultural-worker if he or she has resided in the united states and performed seasonal agricultural-work in the united states for at least 90 man-days during the twelve-month-period ending may 1 , 1986 . -1 ( 2 ) when does the seasonal agricultural-worker normally seek legal-representation ? ( 3 ) what are the common-claims of seasonal agricultural-workers seeking legal-representation ? ( 4 ) when do the claims of seasonal agricultural-workers generally-ripen ? ( 5 ) how long does it typically take to resolve seasonal agricultural-workers ' legal-claims ? ( 6 ) what is the established-practice of lsc-recipients in representing seasonal agricultural-workers ? ( 7 ) what is the likelihood that private-counsel is available to represent aliens who are in the united states under temporary visas or who may temporarily leave the united states ? ( 8 ) under what circumstances do seasonal agricultural-workers commonly leave the united states ? ( 9 ) what are the implications of the presence-requirement on recipient-attorneys ' professional-obligations to their clients ? 4 the federal register notice identified a number of possible-interpretations of the presence-requirement : ( 1 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal-assistance arises ; ( 2 ) an alien must be physically-present when legal-representation is commenced ; and ( 3 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states any time the alien is provided legal-assistance from an lsc grantee.5 this report of the commission identifies the current-interpretation used by lsc grantees and the impact of alternative-interpretations on all categories of eligible-aliens . the commission held-hearings at : ( 1 ) duke university law-school , durham , north carolina on march 27 , 1999 ; and ( 2 ) stanford university , stanford , california on april 10 , 1999 . all requests to provide live-testimony at one of the two public-hearings were granted . 4 64 fed . reg . 8140 , 8141 ( 1999 ) . 5 id . ii . factual-findings the commission has compiled factual-findings that address the questions identified in the federal register notice described above . a . categories of aliens-eligible for lsc-funded legal-services 1 . current-law lsc representation of aliens is limited to certain-classes of aliens who broadly may be described as lawful permanent-residents , prospective lawful permanent-residents and one specific-group of temporary , nonimmigrants.6 `` lawful permanent-resident '' is a term of art under the immigration and nationality act 6 under current-law , lsc-recipients may provide legal-assistance to an alien if the alien is present in the united states and falls within one of several designated categories : ( a ) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent-residence as defined in section 101 ( a ) ( 20 ) of the immigration and nationality act ( 8 u.s.c . 1101 ( a ) ( 20 ) ) ; ( b ) an alien who - ( i ) is married to a united states citizen or is a parent or an unmarried-child under the age of 21 of such a citizen ; and ( ii ) has filed an application to adjust the status of the alien to the status of a lawful permanent-resident under the immigration and nationality act ( 8 u.s.c . 1101 et seq . ) , which application has not been rejected ; ( c ) an alien who is lawfully-present in the united states pursuant to an admission under section 207 of the immigration and nationality act ( 8 u.s.c . 1157 ) ( relating to refugee-admission ) or who has been granted asylum by the attorney-general under such act ; ( d ) an alien who is lawfully-present in the united states as a result of withholding of deportation by the attorney-general pursuant to section 243 ( h ) of the immigration and nationality act ( 8 u.s.c . 1253 ( h ) ) ; [ section 1253 ( h ) was redesignated as section 1231 ( b ) ( 3 ) , restriction on removal , and amended by the illegal-immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iiraira ) ] ( e ) an alien to whom section 305 of the immigration reform and control act of 1986 ( 8 u.s.c . 1101 note ) applies , but only to the extent that the legal-assistance provided is the legal-assistance described in such section ; or ( ina ) , 8 u.s.c . § 1101-1504 ( 1994 & supp . ii 1996 ) , and is defined in the statute as `` the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration-laws . '' 8 u.s.c . § 1101 ( a ) ( 20 ) ( 1994 ) . the group of prospective lawful permanent-residents includes both applicants for permanent-resident-status and likely prospective-applicants based on their current-status in the united states as individuals fleeing-persecution ( refugees , asylees , conditional-entrants and aliens granted-relief from removal by an immigration judge ) .7 there is one category of eligible-aliens , agricultural-workers under the h-2a program , who are aliens only temporarily in the united states . as noted above , representation of h-2a workers is limited to specific-subject matters arising under the h-2a employment-contract . because of the special representational-issues regarding this category of eligible-aliens , we will examine it in detail . 2 . temporary agricultural-workers under the h-2a program h-2a aliens , as the only category of eligible-aliens who reside in the united states temporarily , are particularly affected by the issue before the commission because of their necessarily-short periods of time in the united states . h-2a aliens are non-immigrants , who reside in a foreign-country but come to the united states temporarily to perform agricultural-labor or services for a specified-employer or employers . 8 u.s.c . § 1101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( h ) ( ii ) ( a ) ( 1994 ) . their term of stay in the united states is dependent upon the agricultural-needs of the employer , but by law can not exceed one year . 8 c.f.r . § 214.2 ( h ) ( 5 ) ( iv ) ( 1999 ) . the h-2a program for temporary agricultural-workers is a complex regulatory-scheme devised by congress to meet competing-concerns : the need of agricultural-employers for workers , and the need ( f ) an alien who is lawfully-present in the united states as the result of being granted conditional-entry to the united states before april 1 , 1980 , pursuant to section 203 ( a ) ( 7 ) of the immigration and nationality act ( 8 u.s.c . 1153 ( a ) ( 7 ) ) , as in effect on march 31 , 1980 , because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race , religion , or political-calamity . omnibus consolidated recissions and appropriations-act of 1996 , tit . v , § 101 , pub . l. no . 104134 , 110 stat . 1321 , 1321-55 , as incorporated by district of colombia convention center revenues , pub . l. no . 105-227 , 112 stat . 1515 ( 1998 ) , implemented by 45 c.f.r . pt . 1626 ( 1999 ) . 7further , current-law allows the representation of any alien who herself or whose child has beensubject to domestic-violence . however , the representation is limited to preventing or obtaining relief from the violence . the representation may occur only with non-lsc-funds . eligibility for legal-assistance for this category of aliens is not dependent upon the alien being `` present in the united states .

'' ) . analyzed in light of these canons of interpretation , the corporation 's appropriations-act requires that an alien must be '' present in the united states '' in order to be eligible for legal assistance.12 construing the term `` present '' according to its ordinary-meaning , it is clear that the statute requires the alien to be 13 physically-present in the united states at some point . this conclusion does not end the inquiry , however , because the question before the commission is not whether an alien must be physically-present in the united states , but when the alien must be present in order to be entitled to lsc representation . here , the language provides no express-statement on when an alien must be present in the united states and other familiar-terms of immigration-law , such as `` continuous physical-presence '' are not used . the factual-record and the statutory-scheme in which the language arises , on the other hand , provide an important-context for consideration of the legal-question of when an alien must be '' present in 12 the statutory-provision is implemented in the corporation's alien-eligibility-rule . 45 c.f.r . pt . 1626 ( 1999 ) . 13 the term `` united states '' is defined in the ina and part 1626 as `` the continental united states , alaska , hawaii , puerto rico , guam , and the virgin islands of the united states . '' see id §1626.2 ( h ) ; 8 u.s.c.§ 1101 ( a ) ( 38 ) . the united states . '' as the corporation has noted , the statutory-language may be read alternately to require that ( 1 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal-assistance arises ; ( 2 ) an alien must be physically-present only when legal-representation is commenced ; or ( 3 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states any time the alien is provided legal-assistance from an lsc grantee.14 no single-interpretation , however , is clearly compelled by the statutory-language . for example , nothing in the lsc authorization language keys representation to when the cause of action arises or specifically requires that the alien be present when the representation commences . in particular , the statute does not expressly require that an alien be continuously physically-present in the united states throughout the period of representation in order to be eligible for legal-assistance . consideration of the immediate-context in which the language appears raises further questions regarding the meaning of the presence-requirement . the statute 's application of the presence-requirement to legal permanent-residents , for example , is in some tension with the fact that those aliens are legally entitled to leave the united states temporarily without affecting their immigration-status . see discussion-supra part ii ( c ) ( 1 ) . furthermore , h-2a workers by definition are physically-present in the united states only temporarily . reading `` presence '' in the statute to require uninterrupted , continuous physical-presence would mean that congress , without using such language , intended to deny lsc representation to aliens who engaged in federally-authorized-travel that did not affect their immigration-status . in the case of h-2a workers , the reading would require the conclusion that congress intended to provide h-2a workers with legal-services-representation on claims arising from their employment-contracts only for the very brief-periods that the workers are in the united states -- potentially rendering the promise of legal-representation largely-meaningless . these difficulties support further inquiry into the meaning of the presence-requirement . in short , an examination of the language of the presence-requirement and the statutory-context in which it arises raises a number of interpretive-problems and fails to resolve the question of when an alien must be present in the united states in order to be entitled to legal-services-representation . the commission concludes that the statutory-language is ambiguous on this point . b . legislative-history 1 . origins of the presence-requirement the legislative-history provides assistance in analyzing the presence-requirement . the lsc act of 1974 , as amended , was adopted '' to provide equal-access to the system of justice in our nation for individuals who seek redress of grievances ; . . . to provide high quality legal-assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to afford adequate legal-counsel ; . . . [ and to ] provid [ e ] legal-assistance to those who face an economic-barrier to adequate legal-counsel . '' 42 u.s.c . § 2996 ( 1994 ) . the lsc act itself 14 64 fed . reg 8140 , 8141 ( 1999 ) . includes no restrictions on the provision of legal-assistance by lsc-recipients to aliens . however , in the early-1980s congress began restricting legal-assistance to aliens by lsc-recipients pursuant to provisos in the corporation 's appropriations acts . originally , these provisos permitted the use of lsc-funds for legal-assistance to an alien if the alien was `` a resident of the united states '' and fell within one of the permissible alien-categories , all of which required that an alien was in lawful status.15 see , e.g. , fiscal year appropriations , 1982 , pub . l. no . 97-51 , 95 stat . 958 ( 1981 ) ; fiscal year appropriations , 1983 , pub . l. no . 97-377 , 96 stat . 1830 ( 1982 ) ; and a long series of continuing-resolutions which included the residency-requirement . `` residence '' is a term of art within the meaning of immigration-law and is not synonymous with physical-presence . in re olan , 257 f. supp . 884 ( s.d . cal 1966 ) .16 resident-aliens are allowed to enter and leave the united states temporarily without relinquishing their status . see discussion-infra part ii ( c ) ( 1 ) . thus , prior to fy 1984 , lsc-recipients were authorized to represent aliens who were legal-residents of the united states regardless of whether the alien was absent from the united states during some part of the representation . in drafting the corporation 's fiscal year ( fy ) 1984 appropriations-act , congress for the first time replaced the language `` resident of the united states '' with `` present in the united states . '' departments of commerce , justice , and state , the judiciary , and related appropriations-act , 1984 , pub . l. 98-166 , 97 stat . 1071 ( 1983 ) . the legislative-history reveals no explanation for this change . the phrase `` present in the united states '' appears to have originated in proposed legislation that would have expanded the categories of aliens-eligible for lsc funded representation.17 the shift in language may have been based 15 from before the 1983 amendment until 1986 , the categories of eligible-aliens included : ( 1 ) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent-residence ; ( 2 ) an alien who was either married to a united states citizen or was a parent or an unmarried-child under the age of twenty-one-years of such a citizen and who had filed an application for adjustment of status under the ina ; ( 3 ) an alien who was lawfully-present in the united states as a refugee or who had been granted asylum by the attorney-general ; ( 4 ) an alien who was lawfully-present in the united states as a result of the attorney-general 's withholding of deportation ; and ( 5 ) an alien lawfully-present in the united states as a result of being granted conditional-entry . see e.g. , public-laws 98-107 ( 1983 ) ; 98-166 ( 1983 ) ; 98-411 ( 1984 ) ; 99-103 ( 1985 ) . 16the term `` residence '' is defined in the ina as `` the place of general-abode ; the place ofgeneral-abode of a person means his principal , actual-dwelling-place in fact , without regard to intent . 8 u.s.c.§ 1101 ( a ) ( 33 ) ( 1994 ) . 17 the expanded list of eligible-aliens included : `` ( 1 ) spouses , parents , and unmarried-citizens [ sic ] [ children ] of permanent-residents ; ( 2 ) cuban and haitian-entrants as defined in paragraph ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of § 501 ( e ) of public-law 96-422 , as in effect on april 1 , 1983 ; ( 3 ) persons paroled into theunited states ; and ( 4 ) aliens-eligible for derivative u.s. citizenship under § 212 ( d ) ( 5 ) of the immigration and nationality act . '' h.r . rep. no . 98-206 , at 49 ( 1983 ) . spouses and parents of permanent-residents could only be in the united states , if at all , in temporary , nonimmigrant classification and therefore would not be residents of the united states . -46on the recognition that aliens in some of the proposed categories would not possess `` residence '' in the united states under the meaning of the ina ( for example , parolees and cuban/haitian entrants ) . as noted above , the requirement of `` presence '' is frequently used in immigration-laws to describe categories of aliens within the united states who may not have established '' residence . '' the proposed legislation was defeated , but the phrase '' present in the united states '' replaced the residence-language found in earlier statutes . the new language received virtually no discussion ; nothing in the legislative-history suggests that congress intended to adopt new or more stringent-restrictions on alien-representation . statements in the senate suggest that congress may not have been aware that the presence-language survived the defeat of the amendment.18 in short , the fy 1984 change appears to have been the result of the proposal to expand lsc representation to aliens who were merely `` present '' as opposed to lawful-residents . there is no evidence that congress intended to deprive permanent-resident-aliens of continuous-representation upon their leaving the country . following the statutory-change , lsc issued no new regulations interpreting the language , congress called for no new interpretation , and lsc grantee-practice did not change . 2 . h-2a representation in 1986 , congress passed the immigration reform and control act of 1986 , which expressly authorized lsc-recipients to provide legal-assistance to h-2a workers and special agricultural-workers ( saws ) . immigration reform and control act of 1986 § 305 , 302 , pub . l. no . 99-603 , 100 stat . 3359 ( codified at 8 u.s.c.§§ 1101 note and 1160 ( g ) ( 1994 ) ) . congress avoided having to amend the lsc appropriations-bills by specifically creating in irca the legal fiction that h-2a workers would be deemed lawful `` permanent-resident-aliens '' for the purposes of legal-services-representation under the existing-categories of eligible-aliens . irca § 305 , 8 u.s.c . § 1101 note ; april comments at 55 ( comment of howard l. berman , member of congress ) ; april testimony at 131 ( testimony of romano l. mazzoli , louis d. brandeis school of law , university of louisville ) ; april testimony at 128 ( testimony of mark schacht , california rural legal-assistance foundation ) . because saws and h-2a workers were deemed to be permanent-resident-aliens , they became subject to the presence-requirement in the corporation's appropriations-act . see march comments at 33 ( comment of bill beardall , texas rural legal-aid ) . legal-assistance to h-2a workers was expressly limited to `` matters relating to wages , housing , transportation , and other employment-rights as provided in the worker 's specific-contract . '' irca § 305 , 8 u.s.c . § 1101 note ( 1994 ) . the legislative-history establishes that legal-representation for h-2a workers was a crucial-part of the legislative-compromise that established the h-2a program . the creation of the h-2a program was controversial , given the history of prior-temporary agricultural-programs such as the bracero-program . congress was aware of the problems that had arisen under such programs , and of the special-vulnerability of temporary foreign workers.19 during floor-debate , considerable-concern was expressed about the 18 see 129 cong . rec . s28937 ( oct. 21 , 1983 ) ( statement of sen. grassley ) ; 129 cong . rec . s29836 ( oct. 21 , 1983 ) ( statement of sen. rudman ) . 19the conference-report on irca noted in discussing the saw program that `` the committeewas ever mindful of the reports of abuses that occurred during the old bracero-program . '' see h.r . vulnerability and exploitation of such workers and the need for legal-representation to give meaning to their legal-rights . congressman berman explained on the house floor : part and parcel of that agreement was an understanding that the h-2 workers would be entitled if they otherwise qualified , and only if they otherwise qualified , to legal-services-representation , because without that , the protections contained for those workers , the housing-protections , the domestic , the transportation protections , the piecework-rate and adverse-impact wage rates protections become utterly-meaningless . the fact is the history of the abuses in that h-2 program , which has been documented time and time again , can not be corrected without effective-representation , as you could easily contemplate guest-workers coming here for a short period of time , hoping to come back again , anxious to pick up a wage considerably higher than the wage they might be making in their own country , have no individual-ability and no effective collective-ability to enforce the protections that the u.s. law is supposed to guarantee them . 132 cong . rec . h9866-68 ( oct. 10 , 1986 ) ( statement of rep. berman ) ; see also march comments at 35 ( comment of bill beardall , texas rural legal-aid ) ; april comments at 53-58 ( comment of howard l. berman , member of congress ) . representative schumer agreed : [ y ] ou can give people all the rights you want , but if they have no way to enforce those rights , those rights are meaningless . we all know that ins is terribly-overburdened ; we all know that the department of agriculture , rep. no . 99-682 ( i ) , at 83 ( 1986 ) . the report quoted the following-testimony from the western growers association : the bracero-program has been likened by some to indentured slavery where employer-exploitation was rampant and inhumane . . . . some of the abuses that took place underthe-bracero-program can be directly attributed to the way the program was administered . the most glaring-problem was the contractual-relationship that existed requiring an employee to work for one employer . this , some argue , gave-employers the ability to require more from bracero-workers based on a threat or promise they would be sent back to mexico . . . .

'' 132 cong . rec . h9868 ( oct. 10 , 1986 ) ( statement of rep. morrison ) . the legislative-history of irca makes clear that congress intended for lsc-recipients to provide meaningful legal-representation to h-2a workers on matters arising under the employment-contract . the conference-report to irca explained the provision of legal-services to h-2a aliens as follows : legal-services are to be made available to h-2 aliens with regard to housing , wages , transportation and other conditions of employment under their h-2 contract . . . . it is the intent of the conferees that contractsentered into shall not violate any provision of the immigration and nationality act authorizing the h-2 program or any regulations issued-pursuant to that act . further , the conferees intend that the conference-substitute will secure the rights of h-2 agricultural-workers under the specific-contract under which they were admitted to this country . see h. conf . rep. no . 91-1000 , at 3 ( 1986 ) ; see also march comments at 34 ( comment of bill beardall , texas rural legal-aid ) . the legislative-history contains no evidence that congress believed it was limiting legal-representation of h-2a workers to the period when such workers were physically-present in the united states . neither the proponents nor the opponents of legal-services-representation argued that such a time-limit applied . all the comments made regarding-limitations on lsc representation for h-2a workers focused on the restriction of the subject-matter of such representation to claims arising from the worker 's employment contract.20 in adopting the h-2a provision in irca , congress was aware that h-2a workers were allowed 20representative simpson , for example , stressed that `` [ t ] he legal-services that will be availableto h-2 workers - and they are foreign-nationals . . . - are limited only to housing , and transportation and wages and anything within the terms of the contract , nothing more . . . .the legal-services are strictlylimited to that .

states only temporarily . congress must also be presumed to have authorized the representation with knowledge of the presence-requirement in the corporation's appropriations-act . south dakota v. yankton sioux tribe , 522 u.s. 329 , 118 s.ct . 789 , 801 ( 1998 ) ; united states v. hanousek , 176 f.3d 1116 , 1121 ( 9th cir . 1999 ) . it is unlikely that congress would have added h-2a workers to the categories of eligible-aliens without reviewing the restrictions on representation - including the presence-requirement - that had been included annually in the corporation 's appropriations-act . indeed , congress crafted the provision in irca permitting h-2a representation to be consistent with the language in the lsc appropriations-act . thus , irca deemed h-2as to be `` permanent-resident-aliens '' -a category-eligible for lsc legal-assistance -- for the purposes of receiving legal-assistance from the corporation.21 according to the comment from representative berman provided to the commission , congress was aware of the presence-requirement and intended that the requirement be consistent with the provision of meaningful-representation to the h-2a workers under irca : those of us who actively participated in drafting-section 305 , granting lsc the ability to represent h-2a workers and h-2a eligibility for such services , were very much-aware of the alien-representation-restrictions in the annual lsc appropriations-bills ... congress did not view the present in the united states language in the appropriations-bill as limiting the representation of h-2a workers to the time period during which they remained in the united states . the h-2a workers ' presence in the united states under the temporary-worker-visa entitled them to lsc eligibility . april comments at 55-56 ( comment of howard l. berman , member of congress ) . h-2a workers were to be treated as permanent legal-residents for the limited-purpose of legal-services-representation for claims on their contracts . this legislative-history suggests that congress , with full-knowledge that h-2a workers were only in the united states on a temporary-basis , intended that their rights under their h-2a contracts be protected by being given access to meaningful legal-services . nothing in the congressional-debate discussing the 21 section 305 of irca provided that : a nonimmigrant-worker admitted to or permitted to remain in the united states under section 101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( h ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of the immigration and nationality act . . . for agricultural-labor or service shall be considered to be an alien described in section 101 ( a ) ( 2 ) of such act [ a permanent-resident-alien ] . . .for purposes of establishing eligibility for legal-assistance under the legal-services corporation act ( 42 u.s.c . 2996 et seq . ) but only with respect to legal-matters relating to wages , housing , transportation , and other employment-rights as provided in the worker 's specific-contract under which the nonimmigrant was admitted . limitation of legal-services to rights under the h-2a contract ever suggested that representation could last only as long as the h-2a worker remained in the united states . therefore , we should choose the interpretation of presence that effectuates the congressional-purpose to provide meaningful-representation to h-2a workers under their contracts . 3 . 1996 continuing resolution in the 1996 omnibus continuing resolution , congress revised the restrictions on alien-assistance by applying the restrictions to all funds received by lsc-entities . pub . l. no . 104-134 , 110 stat . 1321 . congress also for the first time explicitly added h-2a workers to the categories of aliens-eligible for legal-assistance under the lsc appropriations-act , although that assistance remained limited to claims under the workers ' employment-contract . the other categories of aliens and the presence-requirement were retained . omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations-act , 1999 , pub . l. no . 105-277 , 112 stat . 2681 , incorporating by reference omnibus consolidated recissions and appropriations-act of 1996 , § 504 ( a ) ( 11 ) , pub . l. no . 104-134 , 110 stat . 1321 . nothing about the application of the `` is present '' language to the alien-categories was altered . the legislative-history of the 1996 revision contains no discussion of the `` present in the united states '' requirement and no indication that congress sought to alter existing-practice regarding the representation of aliens . see march comments at 251 ( comment of alan houseman , center for law & social-policy ) . the mccollum-stenholm-bill , on which the 1996 appropriations were based , did not address the presence-requirement , and the statement accompanying the introduction of that bill noted only that the bill incorporated the provisions from irca into the existing appropriation 's provisions on representation of certain-aliens . see id . thus , the 1996 revision simply brought together in one place the pre-existing-provisions regarding-representation of aliens , and applied these restrictions to all funds of an lsc-recipient . neither the language nor the legislative-history of the statute suggest that congress intended to alter the application of the presence-requirement . in sum , the legislative-history of the presence-requirement confirms that congress intended to provide meaningful-representation to eligible-aliens , including h-2a workers on claims arising from their employment-contract ; and that congress did not understand the presence-requirement to severely alter or restrict this representation . the legal-services act was adopted to provide effective legal-representation to low-income-persons . see april testimony at 9 ( testimony of cynthia rice , california rural legal-assistance-program ) . the presence-language appeared in the lsc appropriations-act as part of an effort to expand lsc representation to aliens other than lawful-residents , and does not appear to have been intended to limit lsc representation to aliens who were continuously physically-present in the united states . similarly , the express-purpose of section 305 of irca was to '' secure the rights of h-2 agricultural-workers under the specific-contract under which they were admitted to this country . '' see h. conf . rep. no . 91-1000 , ( 1986 ) . such representation was intended to prevent the exploitation of foreign h-2a workers and to ensure that the wages and working-conditions of u.s. workers would not be undermined . finally , nothing in the 1996 legislation altered the effect of the presence-requirement on h-2a 's or any other alien category . c. implications of the presence-requirement the factual-record provides an important-context for consideration of the legal-question of the meaning of the presence-requirement for representation by lsc grantees . as noted above , three possible-interpretations of the presence-language were listed in the corporation 's federal register notice : ( 1 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal-assistance arises ; ( 2 ) an alien must be physically-present only when legal-representation is commenced ; and ( 3 ) an alien must be physically-present in the united states any time the alien is provided legal-assistance from an lsc grantee.22 upon careful-consideration of the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative-history , the commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of congress . furthermore , the record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered by the corporation in the federal register notice would contradict congress ' clear-purpose of providing meaningful legal-representation to indigent lawful-aliens and lead to absurd-results . 1 . unrestricted-categories in giving-content to the presence-requirement , it is important to distinguish between the unrestricted-categories of aliens and h-2a workers . the record before the commission establishes that permanent-residents and other aliens frequently leave the united states to visit spouses and children , to address family-problems , and to survive during long periods of unemployment in the united states . the category of permanent-residents includes commuter-aliens , who work in the united states but whose actual-residence is across the border in mexico . all of these aliens are legally authorized to leave and re-enter the united states . as applied to the situation of unrestricted-aliens , the three interpretations of the presence-requirement suggested in the federal register notice would lead to unintended and absurd-results . under an interpretation that the alien must be physically-present when the cause of action commenced , or legal-representation began , an alien who was evicted from her apartment , or against whom divorce-proceedings were commenced while she was temporarily out of the united states to attend a funeral or attend to a family-emergency , would be barred from lsc representation . lsc-attorneys representing-commuter-aliens who migrate daily would be placed in the predicament of representing such aliens only in claims that happened to arise during the portion of the day when the alien was in the united states . under an interpretation that the alien must be physically-present when the representation commenced , an alien who was temporarily outside the united states would be barred from obtaining legal-services-representation on 22 64 fed . reg . 8140 , 8141 ( 1999 ) . any matter during her absence . these interpretations would also invite exploitation by allowing-litigants to simply wait until an alien temporarily departed the united states before cutting off workers-compensation-benefits , initiating-eviction , repossession , divorce or child-custody-proceedings , or otherwise triggering the cause of action or a need for representation . u.s. agricultural recruiters in mexico could willfully misrepresent working-conditions to permanent legal-residents across the border , knowing the alien would be barred from legal-assistance on her federally-protected mswpa claim . requiring a permanent legal-resident-alien to be physically-present in the united states throughout the course of lsc legal-representation would also be unworkable and lead to absurd-results . the record is undisputed that many of the kinds of lawsuits involving permanent-resident-aliens and other unrestricted-aliens take months , if not years , to reach a conclusion , and that permanent-residents and other eligible-aliens regularly travel outside the united states . an interpretation that required the alien to be continuously-present throughout the course of the litigation would confront indigent-aliens with the hobson 's choice of either accepting-representation or visiting their families abroad . moreover , requiring legal-services-attorneys to monitor their clients ' movements and formally withdraw whenever the client left the country would creating extraordinary-burdens for the lsc grantees , the clients , opposing-parties , and the courts . an attorney whose client had to travel to mexico to attend her father 's funeral , for example , would have to withdraw from the case during the client 's absence . see april testimony at 139-140 ( testimony of sylvia argueta , mexican american legal defense and education fund ) . lsc-attorneys representing alien-clients living in border-communities would face the prospect that they could work on a client 's case in the morning when the client was in el paso but not in the afternoon when the client was shopping in juarez . see april testimony at 109 ( testimony of lynn coyle , lawyers committee for civil-rights under law ) . application of this interpretation to the u.s.-mexico border would disrupt access of permanent legal-residents to the legal-system in the poorest region of the united states . see march comments at 155 ( comment of michael wyatt , texas rural legal-aid , et . al ) . it also would provide perverse-incentives to opposing-litigants to drag out legal-proceedings with the expectation that an alien might have to temporarily depart from the country , or engage in other forms of procedural-abuse . see march comments at 74 ( comment of keith s. ernst , attorney at law ) ; march comments at 201 ( comment of jose padilla and cynthia l. rice , california rural legal-assistance ) ; april testimony at 21 ( testimony of cynthia rice , california rural legal-assistance ) . the private-bar and other nonprofit legal-services-providers are neither-available , willing , or able to take over the representation of these populations . as one witness with extensive-experience organizing private pro-bono activities put it , `` the likelihood that private-lawyers will take on clients who would be excluded from lsc representation by the stringent-interpretation of [ the presence ] requirement is zero . '' april testimony at 41 ( testimony of jack londen , attorney at law ) . the legislative-history contains no evidence that congress intended lsc representation of legal permanent-residents and other aliens to turn on the accident of where an alien happened to be at the moment the cause of action arose or the litigation commenced , or to require the alien to be continuously physically-present throughout the course of representation . the commission does not believe that congress intended to force resident-aliens to choose between temporary-trips outside the united states and continued representation in pending-litigation . the commission has not been able to discern any congressional-purpose that would be served by tying the right to representation on movements that have no effect on either the alien 's lawful-immigration-status or her legal-right to pursue her claim in u.s. courts . the commission is unwilling to recommend an interpretation of the statute that produces such consequences , absent an express congressional-intent that such burdens be imposed . 2 . h-2a aliens the factual-record before the commission demonstrates that congress ' purpose of providing meaningful-representation to h-2a workers for claims arising under their employment-contracts can not be accomplished under the original-interpretations offered in the federal register notice . many of the contract-rights that were mandated by congress in irca -- such as reimbursement for return-transportation , workers-compensation , the 3/4 guarantee , and claims that a grower failed to mail the worker 's final-paycheck -- often do not arise until after the worker has returned home . a requirement that the h-2a worker be physically-present in the united states when the cause of action arises or the representation commences thus would deprive h-2a workers of representation on many of the most basic employment-contract protections afforded by congress , directly-contrary to congress ' purpose . as a practical-matter , this interpretation would also bar most other legal-representation for h-2a workers , since the record clearly demonstrates that , due to their fear of losing their jobs , their isolation , lack of resources and language-skills , and vulnerability , h-2a workers often are both unwilling and unable to contact a legal-services-office until after they have left their employment . h-2a aliens are required by law to leave the country within ten days of the termination of their employment , and generally remain in the control of the employer during this period . the interpretations could also create incentives for abuse . an interpretation that the representation must commence while the alien is still in the united states would encourage employers to create even greater obstacles to access to legal-services while the workers are physically in the united states . employers who successfully excluded legal-services-representatives from their labor-camps or intimidated workers into not contacting legal-services during the course of employment could ensure a workforce without access to legal-representation . under an interpretation that the claim must arise while the worker was in the united states , unscrupulous-employers would be able to exploit the system by , for example , failing to mail a final-paycheck or 3/4 guarantee payment after the h-2a worker left the country , with knowledge that the worker would not be entitled to legal-representation on the claim . alternatively , an interpretation of the presence-requirement that required h-2a workers to be present in the united states throughout the course of the representation would eviscerate their right to legal-representation altogether . h-2a workers by definition are required to leave the united states within a year , and the record establishes that most h-2a workers are physically-present in the united states for only two to five months . the record establishes that , with the exception of the most minor and undisputed-claims , none of the employment-claims for which congress authorized representation can be completed during the brief-period that the h-2a worker is in the country , even if the claim arose early during the worker 's stay and the worker was immediately-able to contact legal-services . many of the claims of h-2a workers are legally-complex , and all take months , if not years , to litigate to completion . the contradiction between this interpretation and congress ' purpose of providing meaningful-representation for h-2a workers is patent . the interpretation assumes that congress took from h-2a workers with one hand what it gave with the other . the law will not impute such a purpose to congress . the factual-record , moreover , demonstrates the absurdity of this approach . as the record-shows , it is not uncommon for h-2a workers to contact legal-services for the first time as they board the bus on the way home , and an interpretation that lsc representation is available only while the alien is physically-present creates the prospect that congress authorized legal-services-attorneys to represent such h-2a workers only during the bus-ride to the border . the rule again would invite exploitation . employers could veto a worker 's decision to seek legal-representation by terminating the worker and immediately deporting her . see march comments at 128 ( comment of shelley latin , virginia farmworkers legal-assistance project ) ; march comments at 231 ( comment of melissa a. pershing , legal-services of north carolina ) ; march comments at 272 ( comment of lisa butler , florida rural legal-services ) . employers wishing to avoid paying-workers-compensation could deny coverage until the worker was no longer in the country , or discontinue-payments after the worker had returned home . opposing-litigants and h-2a employers could prolong the legal-process simply by refusing to return legal-service attorneys ' phone-calls or delaying-provision of records to which the worker was entitled to ensure that the h-2a worker left the united states before a dispute could be resolved . see march comments at 231 ( comment of melissa a. pershing , legal-services of north carolina ) ; march testimony at 34 ( testimony of garry g. geffert , west virginia legal-services plan ) . in all of these cases , legal-services would be barred from assisting the worker in these valid employment-contract-claims . in short , the record is clear that h-2a workers are unlikely to raise legal-claims before the end of their employment-contract , that they are required to leave the united states at the end of their contracts , that many of their claims arise after their departure , and that legal-proceedings can not be completed before they depart . furthermore , the availability of legal-services for h-2a workers from non-lsc funded nonprofit-organizations and private-attorneys is extremely-limited ; and government agencies either lack the resources or the legal-authority to enforce the statutory-rights of these workers . the commission recognizes that representation of agricultural-workers was a central-element in the legislative-crafting of the h-2a program . we conclude that a reading of the statute that would bar-representation of an h-2a worker based on the fact that he or she has left the united states would leave h-2a workers without meaningful-representation on their employment-contract-claims , directly-contrary to congress ' express-purpose , and we decline to sanction such a result . iv . conclusion : the meaning of the presence-requirement together , the language , purpose , and legislative-history of the applicable-statutes , and the factual-record before the commission , suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the following-representation : for an alien in one of the unrestricted-categories representation would be authorized so long as the eligible-alien is present sufficient to maintain residence or lawful-immigration-status . under this interpretation , lsc grantees who have begun representation of a permanent-resident-alien may continue that representation should the alien be temporarily outside the united states . grantees may also initiate representation of aliens in the unrestricted-categories who are temporarily outside the united states , provided that they have been present sufficient to maintain and have not abandoned their residence or ina status . lsc grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the united states . for h-2a workers , representation is authorized if the workers have been admitted to and have been present in the united states pursuant to an h-2a contract , and the representation arises under their h-2a contract . lsc grantees are authorized to litigate this narrow-range of claims to completion , despite the fact that the alien may be required to depart the united states prior to or during the course of the representation . lsc grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the united states . as discussed above , this interpretation comports with the language of the presence-requirement in light of congress ' object and purpose . the language and legislative-history of the lsc appropriations acts and the h-2a statute make clear that congress intended to provide meaningful legal-representation to aliens in the designated categories , and there is no evidence that congress considered the presence-requirement to severely restrict this interpretation . to the contrary , the presence-requirement was inserted into the statute for the apparent-purpose of expanding lsc representation of legal-aliens . moreover , as interpreted by the commission , the presence-requirement sustains congress ' clear-goal , since the early-1980s , of restricting lsc representation to aliens with lawful-status . the commission 's interpretation also comports with the consistent-practice of lsc grantees , and the understanding of growers , and of congress . as noted above , lsc grantees have regularly provided legal-assistance to eligible-aliens who have left the united states at some point during the representation . lsc has never taken action against a recipient which continued to represent alien-clients after the client had left the united states . until recently-critics of legal-services-recipients , who had knowledge of the alien-representation-practices of legal-services-recipients , never questioned the legality of a recipient's representation of an alien after the alien had left the united states . it is well settled that a history of practice under a statute can aid in its interpretation , particularly when congress has amended the statute without disapproving of the administrative practice . n.l.r.b . v. hendricks county rural elec . membership corp.,454 u.s. 170 , 177 ( 1981 ) . in this case , the practices of lsc-recipients , of growers , and of congress all support the commission 's interpretation . finally , the commission 's interpretation of the presence-requirement is fully-consistent with the overarching-purpose of the relevant congressional-statutes . the legal-services act was adopted to provide full and effective legal-representation to low-income-persons . in enacting the lsc act , congress declared the need to provide equal-access to the nation 's system of justice for individuals who seek redress of grievances and said attorneys providing legal-assistance must have full-freedom to protect the best interests of their clients in keeping with the code of professional-responsibility , the canon of ethics , and the high standards of the legal-profession . the protections of the h-2a statute were adopted , inter-alia , to ensure that the employment of foreign-workers would not undermine the wages and working-conditions of u.s. workers , and congress provided legal-services-representation `` to secure the rights of h-2 agricultural-workers '' under their employment-contracts . the record before the commission is undisputed that lsc-entities can not provide full and meaningful-representation to h-2a workers and to many other eligible-aliens under the alternative-constructions of the presence-requirement . see march comments at 132 ( comment of shelley latin , virginia farmworkers legal-assistance project ) ; march comments at 143 ( comment of d. michael dale , oregon law center , and janice morgan , legal-aid-services of oregon ) ; march comments at 267 ( comment of lisa butler , florida rural legal-services ) ; march testimony at 41 ( testimony of garry g. geffert , west virginia legal-services plan ) ; march testimony at 51-52 ( testimony of mary lee hall , legal-services of north carolina ) ; march testimony at 107 ( testimony of javier riojas , texas rural legal-aid ) ; march testimony at 148 ( testimony of rob williams , florida legal-services ) . instead , such interpretations would simply promote the exploitation of vulnerable , low-income-aliens . the commission 's interpretation is the only interpretation which comports with the language and legislative-history of the presence-requirement and which permits full and meaningful-representation to aliens-eligible for legal-assistance consistent with congress ' purpose . appendix erlenborn commission members thomas alexander aleinikoff thomas alexander aleinikoff is a professor of law at
