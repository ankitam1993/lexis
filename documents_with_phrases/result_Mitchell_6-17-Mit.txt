postal-worksharing : welfare , technical-efficiency , and pareto optimality presented at the sixth conference on postal and delivery-economics the center for research in regulated industries at rutgers university montreux , switzerland june 17-20 , 1998 robert w. mitchell the author is special assistant to the postal-rate commission , an independent u. s. government-agency , separate from the united states postal-service . the opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent opinions or positions of the postal-rate commission . introduction competition is generally believed to lead to efficiency , be it economic or technical . one method of introducing-competition into postal-systems , without affecting the universal-service-obligation , is through what have been termed `` worksharing '' discounts . one begins with the view that the postal-system is a vertically integrated network involving the collection , sorting , transporting , and final-delivery of mail . under the presumption that the postal-monopoly applies in its clearest form only to the final-delivery process , where scale-economies are likely the greatest , the worksharing-notion is that a discount should be offered to mailers or competitors1 who do portions of the postal-work and then turn the mail over to the postal-service for completion of delivery . as a technical-matter , it should be noted up front that there is no requirement that the mailer or the competitor really perform any particular-piece of work , only that the mail be presented so that the postal-service2 does not have to do that piece of work . in terms of understanding the functioning and effects of the worksharing-process , this distinction will be shown to be a matter of some importance . because simplicity and ease of administration are usually given some weight in rate-setting , the number of worksharing-discounts is limited . such a limitation might not exist in the private sector , where the categories of customers to be served can be prescribed and contract-rates can be tailored to specific-customers or situations , but it is taken as a constraint on broad-based government organizations.3 given this limitation , attention focuses on several obvious-questions : ( 1 ) should worksharing-discounts be offered ? ( 2 ) what are the effects of these discounts on mailers and on the nation ? ( 3 ) how should the size of these discounts be determined ? this paper answers the first primarily in terms of the second . the framework within which these issues will be considered is the existing united states postal-system , about which the author knows a little . 1 the term-competitors stands for private-firms that compete for portions of postal-work , possibly as contractors or agents of mailers or mailing-organizations . 2 the term postal-service is a reference to a country 's dominant or government-run postal-delivery system . references to the united states postal-service will be capitalized . 3 this paper refers almost interchangeably to rate ( s ) and price ( s ) . the former-term is more common in postal-rate-circles and the latter more common in economics . needless to say , these issues involve much more than just the fringes of postal-activity . in the united states , almost-half of the first-class-mailstream is workshared and an even larger portion of standard a4 is either-workshared or has preparation-requirements that involve work the mailer must do . accordingly , the number of dollars involved in worksharing is in the billions and the effects on mailers and the economy are quite-large . also , considerable-sums are spent by the postal-service analyzing the costs associated with worksharing , and mailers/competitors incur considerable-expense litigating their positions on worksharing before the postal-rate commission . although competition and efficiency are important , and may be the bottom line , the movement toward worksharing has been guided by other justifications as well . recognizing that these other justifications overlap and may not all qualify as basic-starting points , it is worthwhile to list them . first , there are those who argue that worksharing is a kind of deaveraging , which brings prices closer to costs , and that deaveraging is both economically efficient and fair . second , there is the view that worksharing-discounts are needed to make the postal-service more competitive , thus helping to stave off threats from competing-carriers and electronic-substitutes . third , there are arguments that worksharing-discounts are needed to send signals to mailers that allow the mailers to decide whether they or their agents can do the work for less than the postal service.5 fourth , there are those who argue that worksharing-discounts are a natural-outcome of traditional '' make or buy '' decisions . that is , businesses commonly-contract out any function that can be done by another firm at a lower cost . fifth , some parties take the efficient-component-pricing ( ecp ) rule as one that should be applied wherever opportunity presents itself . within ecp , there are four possibilities : set the discount equal to the simple-cost-difference between the two categories ; set the discount equal to the average incremental-savings in 4 due to a name-change which is difficult to explain and is confusing , standard-a-mail is the same mail that was formerly identified as third-class . it consists primarily of advertising-mail that is not required to be sent first class . it also includes some mail that might be viewed as community-newspapers or shoppers and some that could be viewed as periodicals . as a formal-matter , standard-a-mail in the united states is broken into two subclasses , one called regular standard a and the other called enhanced carrier-route standard a . this paper will have some implications for this distinction , but will not focus specifically on it . 5 the achievement of having the lowest cost-person do the work is sometimes referred to as an outcome of `` lowest combined cost . '' cost associated with the worksharing-program ; set the price of the workshared-product equal to its marginal-cost-plus the unit-opportunity-cost of the worksharing-program ; or set the discount equal to the savings at the margin.6 finally , there is the notion that it is fair to provide nondiscriminatory downstream-access to the delivery-network . this notion argues that the postal-service should charge competitors the same amount to use the delivery-system that the postal-service-charges itself . since the author has not been able to figure out how much the postal-service-charges itself for delivery , this notion , while sounding-meritorious and politically-correct , will not be mentioned again . these various-approaches sometimes lead to different-discount levels and different associated-sets of effects . also , they sometimes break down in application , when faced with a practical situation that does not align well with the assumptions of the approach . short of that , the information required to apply them can be subject to wide-margins of error and can be costly to develop . this paper has four parts . the first part discusses various kinds of worksharing . the point is that mailers respond to '' worksharing '' discounts in a variety of ways and for a range of reasons , and that these responses need to be understood in order to understand the effects of the discounts . the second part is empirical and discusses various-welfare-aspects of selecting discount-levels for first-class-mail in the united states . the entire-discussion is based on an econometric-model which provides no-shift elasticities,7 discount-elasticities , and , by implication , own-price-elasticities and cross-price-elasticities for basic-mail and workshared-mail . this model is viewed as good for limited-changes in prices and discount-levels . the third-part of the paper takes a broader view and considers welfare , efficiency , and fairness-issues , consistent with the model in part two of the overall worksharing-program for first-class-mail . part iv contains concluding-observations . the focus in all three parts is on real numbers and on how the system is believed by the author to behave . 6 when the workshare-price is equal to the marginal-cost-plus the unit-opportunity-cost , it is often observed that the postal-service is `` indifferent '' to whether the workshare-program is offered . when the discount is equal to the savings at the margin , as much-work as possible will be transferred to the lower cost-provider . part i : aspects of worksharing in the middle-1970s , the rates for first-class-mail and third-class-mail in the united states were very simple . first-class-mail in 1975 paid 10¢ per piece ( plus another 9¢ for each additional-ounce beyond the first ) , regardless of the piece 's shape or processing-characteristics , and regardless of the distance it needed to be carried . similarly , third-class-mail paid 41¢ per pound with a minimum-charge of 7.9¢ per piece . it could be letter-sized , flat-sized , or parcel shaped ; it could go 3,000 miles or across the street ; it could be mixed in a sack with other pieces or it could be in a bundle for a specific 5-digit zip code . in all cases , the rate was the same . now , the situation is quite-different . the rate for the first-class-piece depends on whether it is presorted , on whether it qualifies for an automation-category , on whether it is a letter or a flat within the automation-category , on which of 6-presort-levels it achieves within the automation-category , and on whether it is nonstandard in shape . further , the rate for additional-ounces is considerably less than the rate for the first ounce . the rates for third-class ( now standard a ) are similar but even more complex . one must know whether the piece is a letter or a nonletter , whether it qualifies for an automation-category , whether it qualifies for a carrier-route presorted-category , where it is entered in the system , what its presort-level is , what its weight is , and whether it qualifies as saturation or near saturation . in the latter-case , it must be prepared in what is called the line-of-travel , which is basically the sequence in which the carrier delivers his or her route , and there are other requirements as well . these various-price-differences , all of which are based to some degree at least on studies of actual-cost-differences , send a wide-range of signals to mailers . some of these signals call for a decision on whether to workshare and others do little more than tell the mailer that some pieces cost more to process than others . but whatever their character or however they are viewed , the effects on mailers and on the mailstream have been 7 as will be explained further below , a no-shift-elasticity is an own-price-elasticity under the constraint either that mailers may not shift to and from the workshared-category or that the size of the workshare enormous . mailers are now presorting their mail , barcoding their mail , changing flat-size-pieces into letter-size-pieces , consolidating their mail , and carrying their mail great-distances in order to enter it at specific-locations . presort-firms are collecting the mail , working with their customers on the quality of their addresses and on the machinability of their addresses , sorting the mail , and entering the mail effectively . private trucking-firms have begun operations to do nothing more than carry mail across the country . viewed simply , four specific-discounts are now being offered . the first is for presorting , the second for putting on barcodes and assuring-machinability , the third for drop-shipping , and the fourth for being letter-sized instead of flat-sized . potentially more interesting , however , is to view the discounts in terms of the responses they receive from mailers and the factors associated with those responses . for this purpose , a classification of worksharing types is proposed , with no requirement that the types be mutually exclusive . this will aid in understanding-mailer-responses and in evaluating the benefits of offering the discounts . type-1 worksharing . type-1 worksharing is the simplest kind and is most closely aligned with the plain-meaning of the term '' workshare . '' the discount is given when the mailer or competitor does some of the postal-work and does it in essentially the same way as the postal-service would do the work . for example , a discount could be given for mail presorted into packages , each package being for one 5-digit zip code area . in a type-1 worksharing-situation , the mailer or competitor would sort the mail in essentially the same way that the postal-service would sort the mail . this means collecting the mail and sorting it either by hand or on a sorting-machine . such a machine might have an optical character-reader and might put on a barcode . the purpose here is not to provide reasons or to quantify why the mailer/competitor might be able to do the work for less than the postal-service , despite the likelihood that the mailer/competitor 's scale of operations will be smaller . several possible-reasons , however , are clear . the mailer/competitor might pay lower wages than the postal-service , might succeed in managing and/or scheduling more tightly the sorting-operations , might achieve higher productivity-levels , and might be working with a more discount does not change . uniform and more tightly controlled mailstream . the latter factor exists because postal-systems need to be designed to handle a wide-range of mailpieces , generated by a wide-range of mailers . such operations tend to be higher in cost and may be more difficult to control . a drop-ship-discount might also evoke type-1 worksharing-activity . a mailer sending a quantity of mail to zone 8 might achieve a lower rate if he carries the mail to the destination-mail facility . if he can transport the mail for less than the discount , he will choose to do so . his success in performing the work at a lower cost might be due to an ability to arrange completely-full trucks or to achieve lower-price-contracts with trucking-firms . the latter-possibility might exist if the mailer assumed some risk by placing fewer constraints on the trucking-operator . in pure type-1 worksharing , the analysis of the decision and the benefits is simple . if the mailer/competitor can do the work at a lower cost , he will choose to do it . his welfare-level will be increased by the difference between the discount and his cost of doing the work . the profit-position of the postal-administration depends on how the discount-level is set , an issue that we need not specify here . type-2 worksharing . in a type-2 situation , the mailer/competitor achieves the workshared-result but does the work in a different way from the way the postal-service would do it . the best example of type-2 worksharing involves , again , presort-discounts . either physically or electronically , the mailer may be able to arrange all of his addresses in zip code order . this being done , he can then print together and bundle all of the addresses for one zip code . after this , the addresses in another zip code would be printed . when a worksharing-situation of this kind is faced , there is the potential for the mailer to do the work at considerably less cost than could the postal-service . even if he is sorting the addresses by hand , he has the option of doing the work in a completely different way also , if the same mailing-list is used more than once , or is used again with slight-modification , he can sort once and do many mailings . as a practical-matter , mailers are believed in many cases to be able to do this work for a fraction of the cost the postal-service would face . as a guess , this fraction could easily be in the neighborhood of onequarter to one-eighth . two features of this kind of situation deserve note . first , the mailer may be able to do in one step what the postal-service does in two or more steps . such would be the case if the postal-service requires two sortations to get the mail to the 5-digit level while the computer goes there directly . second , mailers of some volume may be in position to take advantage of this discount without the help of a presort-bureau or mailing-firm . from a welfare-point of view , a type-2 discount situation is extremely-attractive because the potential-gains are large . in effect , the potential exists to achieve the sortation without doing the work ; but if the discount is not offered , none of the benefit will be realized . type-3 worksharing . type-3 worksharing is where the mailer's decision , whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor , is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and his cost of doing the work . the primary-example of this situation is one where the mailer is concerned about the level of service received and finds that taking advantage of the worksharing-discount leads to better service . the most common-service consideration would involve the number of days to delivery , but mailers can also be interested in achieving-delivery on a certain-date or even in reducing the risk that the piece is lost in the mail . two examples of this kind of situation are important . first , a mailer could find that mail presorted and/or barcoded-zips through the system without delay while other mail , which needs more postal attention , is either delayed or is unpredictable . in this situation , the value to the mailer of the improved-service would be considered along with the cost of doing the work.8 second , a mailer considering-drop-shipping could know that mail entered at a destination-facility is always delivered within one or two days while that entered at a distant-location takes much longer and is less predictable . this mailer would clearly consider the value of the improved-service along with the cost of the drop-shipping . 8 some mailers have found that turning the mail over to a presort-firm , which requires time to do the additional-work , results in a 1-day loss in service . in response , some presort-firms provide same-day-entry and some drop ship to nearby-locations . from a welfare-point of view , the situation here also has potential . for example , suppose the discount is 4¢ ( per piece ) and the mailer 's cost of doing the work is 3.8¢ . it would seem on first glance that the gain from having the mailer do the work is only 0.2¢ . but if the value of the improved-service is 1 cent per piece , then the gain from offering the discount is amplified to 1.2¢ . if the discount is not offered , the mailer would clearly not do the work or receive the improved-service . important also is that if the improved-service is not feasible , the mailer could decide to use an alternative to the postal-system . conversely , the mailer could increase his volume if the discount and the associated-service are offered . type-4 worksharing . a type-4 discount situation is where the mailer reduces the work required by changing his behavior in efficient-ways that were either not predicted or that do not seem particularly associated with the nature of the discount . two examples are offered : the first involves drop-ship-discounts and the second involves the letter/flat differential . a drop-ship-discount can be as simple as a price for nationwide mail and a price for mail entered at the destination-office . a mailer in new york could be sending-mail to los angeles . if mailed from new york , he would pay the nationwide-price but if entered in los angeles , he would pay the lower destination-price . if the difference between these two prices is large enough , the mailer could hire a trucking-firm , as discussed above . but there is also the option of having the mail printed by a firm in los angeles , which would make destination-entry quite-natural . without the drop-ship-discount , the mailer will not consider the los angeles printer , even if the printing-cost is the same as in new york . with the drop-ship-discount , the mail might be printed in los angeles and the burden of transportation would be avoided entirely . as a second example , consider the letter/flat differential.9 under such a rate-structure , letter-size-pieces have a lower rate than flat-size-pieces . the discount might be justified on the basis of nothing more than an interest in cost-based-rates , and worksharing might not be an issue . some mailers , however , will convert flats into letters . considering 9 some readers may not view a letter/flat rate-differential as focused on worksharing . i include it here because it is a discount and it can lead to a reduction in postal-work . the cost of delivery and the benefits received by the mailer , the letter-size-piece might be a more efficient-piece for the nation as a whole , but the mailer will not make the change unless a rate-differential is offered . type-5 worksharing . a type-5 situation is one that has worksharing-aspects but which is directed primarily at making the postal-system more competitive . the drop-ship-discount is , again , an obvious-example . suppose a mailer in cleveland has mail that is to be delivered in cleveland . if the postal-service presents him with a rate that does not vary with distance , he may , in effect , be subsidizing other mail . for example , if the average-piece of mail travels 1,000 miles and that is the cost on which the rate is based , mail going over 1,000 miles gets a relative-bargain and mail staying in the office of entry can be viewed as helping to finance the long-distance-mail . now suppose there is a private-delivery-firm in cleveland that is competing with the postal service.10 that private-firm will base its rates on the costs that it incurs , given that it both receives and delivers the mail in cleveland-it will not charge a 1,000-mile rate . if the postal-service-charges only a 1,000-mile rate , with no distance-differentials and no associated drop-ship-discounts , the postal-service will be at a disadvantage and may not be competing effectively . it could easily lose business , even if it is the low-cost-carrier . if the postal-service offers distance-sensitive-rates , it will be more competitive in cleveland . this is the case whether or not any mailers decide on the basis-of-the price differentials to engage in drop-shipping . in short , the rate-structure could be established in order to be competitive or to base the prices on the actual-costs of the mail , and worksharing-activity could occur as a natural-result . section-conclusion . many worksharing-discounts evoke responses based on more than one of the situations described above . for example , presort-discounts have aspects of type 1 , type 2 , type 3 , and maybe some of type 5 . similarly , drop-ship-discounts have multiple-aspects . the reason for delineating these various-types is to emphasize that if the advocacy of offering the discounts is to be analyzed , all of the dimensions need to be considered . 10 the private express-statutes in the united states do not prevent private-firms from delivering-parcels , periodicals , catalogs over 24 pages , or saturation-mail . these firms , however , may not use the mail-boxes . part ii : a specific-model in the docket no . r97-1 rate-case before the postal-rate commission , an econometric-model became available for first-class-mail with the characteristic that basic-mail and workshared-mail are treated separately . the actual-model contains a number of variables.11 for present-purposes , however , interest-centers only on the price-variables and the discount-variables . holding all other variables constant , and integrating their effects into the constant-term , the equation for basic-mail becomes : -0.189 d-0.164 vb = 28.572 pb ( 1 ) and the equation for workshared-mail becomes : -0.289 d0.227 ws = 51.034 pws ( 2 ) where v = volume in billions of pieces , b = basic ( referring to the non-workshared-category of first-class-mail ) , ws = workshare , p = price , and d = discount . the volume-variables are the number of pieces in the category and the price-variables are fixed-weight indexes of the range of prices paid by the mailpieces making up the category . in fiscal year 1996 , the volume of basic ( first-class ) mail was 54.1 billion pieces and the volume of workshared ( first-class presorted ) mail was 39.1 billion . the workshared-mail consists primarily of mail presorted to the 5-digit level , with a small-proportion of carrier-route presorted-mail . some of this mail is also barcoded . the basic-mail consists of all other mail and therefore includes flat-size-pieces as well as letter-size-pieces , and heavy-weight pieces as well as light-weight-pieces . some basic-mail has hand-written addresses but 11 see the direct-testimony of thomas e. thress on behalf of the united states postal-service , usps-t-7 , docket no . r97-1 , u. s. postal-rate commission , pp . 40-41 . mr. thress ' complete-model includes the price of first-class-cards , the price of standard a , the workshare-discount , three lags on these variables , permanent-income , transitory-income , user-costs , certain dummy-variables , and seasonal-coefficients . most is machine addressed . basic-mail also includes some parcels under 11 ounces and some non-standard-pieces . the price-index ( weighted-price ) for basic-mail in 1996 was 39.2¢ and for workshared-mail was 27.6¢.12 the difference between these two is 11.6¢ . this difference , however , reflects much more than just a weighted-average of the discounts available to the workshared-mail . it also includes rate-differences due to weight and to whether the piece is non-standard in shape . the value of d in 1996 was 6.0¢ . this is a weighted-average of the various discounts available for presorting and barcoding . compared to the basic-category , the qualitative-characteristics of the workshare-category are reasonably-uniform . in brief , most workshared-pieces are probably paying a rate of about 27.6¢ . therefore , the similar-pieces which are not workshared , and are not getting the discount of 6.0¢ , are paying a price of 6.0¢ + 27.6¢ = 33.6¢ . we may think , therefore , of the 39.2¢ price for basic-mail as composed of a group of mailers paying 33.6¢ and another group paying , maybe , 45.0¢ . the pieces paying 33.6¢ may be viewed as candidates to become workshared , if the discount is increased . if the prices of all basic-mail were increased , say , 20 % , the 33.6¢ , the 45.0¢ , and the 39.2¢ average would all increase by 20 % . at the new price-level , the ratio of the price of the candidate-mail to the average price of basic-mail would remain the same . if this ratio is designated as g , then : p candidate g = pb ( 3 ) and d = g p b-pws ( 4 ) 12 the variables in the equations are in dollars and in billions of pieces . for ease of discussion , they will be referenced in the text in cents per piece . also , gains and losses in welfare , technical-efficiency , and profits will be referenced in millions of dollars , although certain-graphs may refer to them in billions . the value of g in the situation described above is 0.857 . according to the postal-service 's costing-systems , the per-piece-cost of basic-mail in 1996 was 26.1¢ and the per-piece-cost of workshared-mail was 10.6¢.13 the difference between these two costs is 15.5¢ . these costs are developed primarily to be marginal-costs and will be assumed to be marginal-costs in this paper . this difference of 15.5¢ is due to a range of characteristics which workshared-mail-exhibits . for example , basic-mail has a higher average-weight , with pieces ranging from 1 to 11 ounces , while most workshared-mail weighs in the neighborhood of 1 ounce . also , most workshared-pieces are letter-size and many basic-pieces are flats , which cost more to process . there are other differences as well . the addresses on workshared-pieces are generally thought to be more accurate and are almost always-machine-readable . some basic-pieces have handwritten-addresses , and some basic-pieces are parcels . in order to go much further , we need to know the cost of the pieces that are candidates for moving from the basic-category to the workshare-category . since , in substantial-degree , the rate-setting process in the united states sets discounts equal to associated cost-differences , i am assuming for present-purposes that the current-discount equals the current-cost-difference between the candidate-mail and the workshared-mail . therefore , the cost of the candidate-mail becomes 16.6¢ ( 10.6¢ + 6.0¢ ) . also , i will be assuming that the 6.0¢ cost of the postal-service to take the mail from basic to workshared-condition is constant as limited quantities of mail move back and forth between basic and workshared . this is a simplification of reality , which probably involves a curve with a slight upward-slope . that is , as the discount is increased in steps , the cost to the postal-service of sorting the mail that becomes workshared on step 4 is probably greater than the cost of sorting the mail that becomes workshared on step 3 . this assumption will be relaxed in part iii below , where larger discount-changes are considered . note that since the discount is equal to the savings experienced at the margin as additional-pieces become workshared , the base ( 1996 ) position becomes the efficient-component-pricing ( ecp ) position . in postal-parlance , we would say that the discount equals 100 percent of the cost-avoidance at the margin , or that the passthrough of the avoidance is 100 percent . now that we know the prices , the quantities , and the costs , the total revenue is easily-calculable as $ 31.9988 billion , the total marginal-cost as $ 18.2647 billion , and the contribution to fixed-costs ( or to institutional-costs ) as $ 13.7341 billion . the contribution is defined as the difference between total revenue and total marginal-cost . if this initial-position is assumed to be a breakeven-position , then any other breakeven-position must have this same contribution . note that the demand-equations shown above are somewhat-different from those normally encountered . as shown in equation ( 4 ) , the d term in the vb-equation contains pb , so when pb changes , the discount is affected . the exponent of pb in equation ( 1 ) , then , is not a traditional-elasticity ; rather , it is an elasticity for changes in own-price when the discount remains unchanged , referred to in this paper as a no-shift-elasticity . in order for the discount to remain unchanged when pb is changed , the price of the workshare-category must be changed in an amount exactly-equal to gdpb , as made clear by equation ( 4 ) . note also that equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have the characteristic that ¶vb/¶d = -¶vws/¶d for each observation-point , including 1996.14 as a check , i wanted to have a second model available . the models presented above can be converted for this purpose into more traditional-models , with ordinary-elasticities and cross-elasticities , with the same characteristics at the current-position . substituting-equation ( 4 ) into equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yields : -0.189 ( pb - pws ) -0.164 vb = 28.572 pb ( 5 ) -0.289 ( pb - pws ) 0.227 ws = 51.034 pws ( 6 ) 13 these are the costs as reported by the postal-service . during rate-cases , the postal-rate commission has sometimes made adjustments to postal-service costing . it is doubtful that using adjusted costs would change the nature of the results obtained . 14 this characteristic is a symmetry-condition imposed in the econometrics as the demand-equations were developed . for the own-price-elasticities in a traditional-model , we need respectively : ¶ v pbeb =¶ pb b vb ( 7 ) vp ws ws ws ¶ p v ( 8 ) ws ws for the cross-elasticities ( ce ) in a traditional-model , we need : ¶ vp b ws ceb = ¶pws vb ( 9 ) ¶ v pb ws ce ws =¶ pv ( 10 ) b ws if the partial-derivatives of equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are substituted into equations ( 7 ) - ( 10 ) , we get : eb =-189.0 +-164.0 gpb =-1.1074 g p -p ( 11 ) b ws 227 . 0 p ws ws -= 289 . 0 -- = 3328 . 1 ( 12 ) g-p b ws p ( - ) 164 . 0 ws ceb -= = 7544 . 0 ( 13 ) g-p b ws 227 . 0 cews = pb -p = 2707 . 1 ( 14 ) g b ws putting these into a traditional-model with a constant appropriate to the current-position-yields : -1.1074 pws0.7554 vb = 50.6501 pb ( 15 ) -1.3328 pb1.2707 ws = 23.1120 pws ( 16 ) to those who are conditioned to thinking of the demand for first-class-mail as being rather-inelastic , the elasticity , for example , of -1.1074 may seem high . the reason , however , is clear . if the price of basic-mail is incresed and the price of workshared-mail is held constant , the discount will increase automatically and volume will decline for two reasons : ( 1 ) because the price is higher , some customers will reduce usage and ( 2 ) because the discount is higher , some customers will decide to workshare and will leave basic . in equation ( 15 ) , an increase in pws amounts to a decrease in the discount , causing workshared-mail to stop worksharing and shift to vb . there is clearly a symmetry between changing pws in the vb-equation and changing pb in the vws equation . note , however , that the cross-elasticities stop short of obeying the slutsky-schultz condition . this is because of equation ( 4 ) , which shows that a change in pb and a change in pws do not have the same effect on the discount . we now have two models that are equivalent at the current-position . equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are derived from the testimony of witness-thress and will be referred to as the thress-model or the thress-equations . equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) are the more traditional constant-elasticity equations and will be referred to as the exe ( pronounced e-cross-e ) model or the exe-equations . although built to have the same characteristics at the current-operating-point , they characterize sightly different-behavior as we move away from the current-point . these models represent whatever it is that mailers think about when they decide how much to mail and whether to presort . the mailers know their costs , their options , their preferences , and their other interests , such as service . note that as the discount-increases , more and more mailers workshare . this provides an upward sloping-supply of workshared-mail . in the basic thress-equation , the discount going from its current level of 6.0¢ up to a level of 7.0¢ , with no change in the basic-price , causes the basic-volume to go from 54.1 billion down to 52.7495 billion . thus , a 1-cent increase in the discount causes about 2.5 % of the basic-volume to shift to presort . if anything , at least to the writer , this seems on the small-side . these models have been constructed to represent the system in the neighborhood of the current-operating-point . they should make good-predictions for small or moderate-changes about the current-point . without going too far , the directions of change , the general magnitudes of changes , and the patterns representing the rates of change should be meaningful . two general-kinds of changes will be considered in this part of the paper . the first involves holding the price of the basic-category constant and changing the discount . the second involves keeping the postal-service at breakeven while the discount is changed . in both cases , attention will focus on welfare-levels and technical-efficiency . part iii of the paper will consider changes outside the neighborhood of the current-operating-point . when cross-elasticities are weak or non-existent , welfare changes can be calculated from areas under simple-demand-curves . when cross-elasticities are strong , however , the demand-curves shift . since the models being used here are characterized by strong cross-elasticities , it was necessary to develop a method of dealing with the shifting-curves and with mailers that shift toward worksharing when the discounts-increase . the writer explored several-methods of estimating the effects involved . several decisions had to be made about how various-adjustments would be handled . in most cases , the results are relatively-robust to the decisions made . the approach taken is based on the assumption that mailer decisions on whether to engage in additional-worksharing are based entirely on the absolute-level of the discount . also , the assumption is made that all new worksharing-volume comes from basic-volume . in support of the latter-assumption , it seems reasonable to believe that potential-mailers not now sending-mail are not likely well situated to find worksharing attractive at somewhat higher discount-levels than those at the base-position . another assumption made is that the volume-equations are better able to predict market responses when one variable is changed from the base-position than when both variables are changed . within the framework of these assumptions , three steps are taken . first , the level of the discount is held constant , so that no mailers will change their decision on whether to workshare , and estimates are made for the basic-market . second , the level of the discount is held constant and similar-estimates are made for the workshare-market . third , the discount is allowed to change and estimates are made for the volume that shifts to or from being workshared . note that it is the volume that shifts that can be processed by a higher or a lower cost-provider . therefore , changes in technical-efficiency are based on the shifting-volume . not necessarily in this order , these steps are described in the next two sections . behavior of profits and welfare with discount-changes , basic-price held constant . if the prices of the basic-category were regulated and precluded from going above a certain-level , as might occur under a price-cap arrangement , but the postal-service were given the freedom to adjust the discount and therefore the workshare-price , a natural-question would concern the extent to which the postal-service 's net income ( hereinafter often called profits ) could be changed by changing the discount , and how this change would compare with the welfare-effects on mailers . also , a question can be asked about technical-efficiency-gains and losses as work is shifted to and from the mailers.15 these questions can be answered with both the thress-model and the exe model . the discount is changed directly in the former-model , and by changing the price of workshared-mail in the latter . because it is easier to think about , the discussion will proceed as though the discount were being increased , so that there is more worksharing . all of the equations , of course , apply for both discount-increases and decreases . also , the discussion will focus on the thress-model , with the understanding that similar calculations can be made with the exe model . to simplify the discussion , we will talk about any worksharing as though the mailer were doing it , even though the mailer might turn the work over to another firm ( a firm that might be viewed as competing with the postal-service for portions of the work ) or to a contractor/agent . the first step is to select a range of discounts from 1¢ to 11¢ . this is a large-neighborhood around the current level of 6¢ , but weight need not be given to distant-results . with this done , the workshare-prices ( pws ) can be calculated immediately as g pb -d , where pb remains at the current level of 39.2¢ . next , using equation ( 1 ) , the volume that leaves the basic-category can be calculated as the initial-volume ( 54.1 billion ) less the volume calculated at the current pb and the new discount . graphically , the leaving-shift-volume appears as follows : * vb vb 15 in this paper , technical-efficiency refers to the absolute cost of getting a certain-quantity of work done . getting the work done at a lower cost , regardless of who does the work , is more efficient . technical-efficiency does not related to consumer utility or to consumer-welfare . values at the base ( current ) position are indicated by an * . the leaving-shift-volume * equals vb - vb . a question needs to be answered about whether the above curve is really a demand-curve , since customary-demand curves hold the prices of substitutes constant and this one holds the discount constant . fundamentally , a demand-curve shows how a market responds , given its preferences , to changes in price , when other factors affecting-quantity do not change . i view this demand-curve as showing how the market responds , given its preferences , when other factors affecting-volume do not change , including that no mailer in the market may consider shifting from basic to workshared . the curve , therefore , is customarily-rich in information about the utility the mailers in the market-gain ( or lose ) when the price-changes . the constraint relating to shifting will be relaxed in a separate-step . using workshare-equation ( 2 ) , a new workshared-volume can be calculated using the original-workshare-price and the new discount.16 graphically , the estimation appears as follows : vws* vws 16 in the new position in this exercise , pws will be lower and d will be higher . pws is being held constant at this point in order to focus on the shifting-volume . the difference between vws and vws* is one estimate of the arriving workshare-shift-volume , i.e. , the volume that decided to workshare under the higher discount , left the basic-category , and arrived at the workshare-category . this estimate of the arriving workshare-shift-volume turns out to be larger than the leaving workshare-shift-volume . such , of course , would be expected since the shifting-mailers are getting a lower price . the equation for the basic-category has prices in it , with the understanding that the mailers look at the prices and decide how much-mail to send . as with all demand-functions , the mailers are presumed to understand that they must pay any paper , printing , and preparation-costs associated with their increased use of the mail . the equation for the workshare-category also has prices in it , and may be presumed to model the decisions made by workshare-mailers . in addition to the costs incurred by basic-mailers , however , these mailers incur what are often referred to as user-costs . that is , they must incur costs to accomplish the worksharing , however they do it . the mailers who shift from the basic-category to the workshare-category face an unbalanced-situation with respect to user-cost . specifically , they go from a price requiring no user-cost to a price with a user-cost . therefore , the gain they experience by shifting is not equal to the price-difference ; rather , it is equal to the price-difference less the user-cost they experience . throughout this paper , i assume that the average-user cost for shifting-mail is equal to the original-discount ( under which they chose not to workshare ) plus ½ of the increase in the discount . comparing this estimate of the arriving-shift-volume to the leaving-shift-volume , and assuming the shifting-volume went from the basic-price ( which does not change in this exercise ) to a '' price '' equal to the sum of the new workshare-price and the user-cost , i found that the implied elasticity of the growth of the shifting-volume was generally in the neighborhood of -2.5 to -4.0 . deciding this was unacceptably-large ( in absolute-value ) , i chose instead to increase the leaving-shift-volume with an elasticity of -0.189 , which is the elasticity-thress found for the basic-category when the discount does not change . one could say that we are growing the shift-volume as it moves from its old ( higher ) price-position to its new ( lower ) price-position . for each discount-level , this provides an alternative-estimate of the arriving-shift volumes , based on the leaving-shift-volume and a reasonable attendant-growth . the situation in which the shifting-mailers find themselves can be graphed as follows : * pb pws+ user-cost pws vl va where vl equals the leaving-shift-volume and va equals the arriving-shift-volume . note that the cross-hatched-trapezoid-area is the welfare-gain of the shifting mailers.17 note also that there was no welfare-effect on any other basic-mailers , because they all remained * at the same pb , and then the shift-volume was allowed to leave . the new volume for the workshare-category is taken to be the sum of ( a ) the calculated workshared-volume at the new pws and the original-discount , and ( b ) the arriving-shift-volume . graphically , the situation is as follows : 17 the areas of all trapezoid-like-figures in this paper are estimated by assuming that the right-hand-sides are straight-lines . * vws vi vws where vi ( intermediate ) is the volume of workshared-mail that exists at the new workshare-price and the original-discount , before the shift-volume arrives . the difference between vws and vi is the arriving-shift-volume , va , discussed above . note that the crosshatched-trapezoid-area is the welfare-gain to the workshare-market , given the price-decrease they experience , before the shift-volume arrives . on the question of how much the leaving-shift-volume might grow , there is another effect that needs to be mentioned , although it is not dealt with further in this paper . as worksharing-discounts are given and competitors begin to compete for business and profits , it is often believed that they might succeed in attracting more overall-volume into the system . this is sometimes called a `` beat the bushes '' effect . such would , of course , affect both postal-service finances and mailer-welfare . the basis for believing that volume-growth of this kind might occur is not only that there might be more sales-people and possibly some product-differentiation , but also that these competitors might be able to promote in ways that the postal-service itself can not . in the united states , for example , some competitors are convincing-customers that delivery-service is good , while the same message coming from a postal account-representative might not be as believable . also , there are sometimes-restrictions for policy or appearance-reasons on the ways in which government-enterprises such as postal-services can advertise and promote . one more adjustment is needed . the shifting-volume that leaves the basic-category is in the lower price-range of all the mail in that category . therefore , when the shifting-volume-leaves , the price-index for the basic-category-increases . knowing that the price being paid by the shifting-volume just before it shifted was equal to g times the basic-price , a revised-price-index for the basic-category can be calculated . this revised-price-index must be used to calculate the revenue from the basic-category after the shift-volume-leaves . for each discount , the revenue and the cost at the new position can be calculated . the difference between these two is the gain in profit for the postal-service . the welfare-gain of the mailers is the sum of the welfare-gain of the shifting-volume and the gain of the workshare-market before the shift-volume arrives . both of these areas are cross-hatched above . the technical-gain ( or loss if negative ) for the new position can be calculated as the leaving-shift-volume times the difference between the postal-cost of doing the work and the mailers ' user-cost of doing the work . given our assumption that the postal-service 's cost for doing the work is 6¢ , and knowing that the user-cost is above 6¢ for all discount-increases , we can expect the gain to be negative for all discount-increases . if the discount-decreases from 6¢ , mail which mailers have been sorting for less than 6¢ will shift to the postal-service , and the technical-gain will again be negative . these signs on the technical-gain would be expected for movements from an ecp position . the two graphs on the next-page show the profit-results . the top graph is for the thress-model and the bottom one is for the exe model . several-observations may be made . given a decrease in the discount , with the basic-price held constant , the postal-service profit-increases in both models and appears in the thress-model to reach a peak at a discount of about 2¢ . since 2¢ is rather-distant from 6¢ , however , this result may not be reliable . at a discount of 4¢ , the thress-model shows a profit-increase of $ 563 million and the exe model shows $ 581 million . in these same two cases , respectively , the technical-loss from having the higher-cost-person do the work is $ 37 million and $ 29 million . the technical-losses , experienced in some sense by all mailers , are clearly-small final conference copy thress-model exe model relative to the increase in profit . note also that the slopes of both graphs-decrease in absolute-value as the discount-decreases . several-ceteris-paribus ( one-at-a-time ) changes were then investigated . first , the postal-service 's cost of processing workshared-mail was changed from 16.6¢ to 14.6¢.18 second , the own-price-elasticities in the worksharing-equations were made equal to the corresponding-elasticities in the basic-equations . this removed the finding that the noshift-elasticity of the workshared-mail is greater than that of basic-mail . third , the discount-elasticity in the thress-model was doubled . when any of these changes are made , the corresponding-elasticities for the exe model must be found using-equations ( 11 ) through ( 14 ) . fourth , the discount-elasticity was set equal to zero , with corresponding-zeros in the exe model . the findings are summarized in the following-table . description ( d=4¢ instead of 6¢ ) profit gain ( thress & exe ) tech . gain ( thress & exe ) table 1 at the current-position , which involves a fixed-basic-price and a worksharing-discount of 6¢ , the following-observations may be made , using-figures from the thress-equations . 1 . assuming the postal-service cost of doing the workshare-work is 6¢ , a reduction of 2¢ in the worksharing-discount will cause a profit-increase of about $ 563 million . due to 18 the implication of this 2¢ reduction in the cost of processing workshared-mail is that the postal-service can sort the mail for 4¢ instead of 6¢ . work being done by a less efficient-provider , there would be an associated technical-loss of about $ 37 million , which is relatively-small . 2 . under the same conditions , if the postal-service cost of doing the workshare-work is actually 4¢ instead of 6¢ , the profit gain from reducing the worksharing-discount by 2¢ would be notably greater at $ 637 million , and there would be a technical-gain of $ 37 million . 3 . for discount-decreases , the profits of the postal-service increase much more rapidly ifthe-discount-elasticities ( and associated cross-elasticities ) are low rather than high . 4 . the profit-incentive for the postal-service to decrease the discount is less when the no-shift-own-price-elasticity of the workshare-category is greater than that of the basic-category . the next two graphs , constituting-figure 2 , show postal-service profits and mailer-welfare-gains , as well as the sum of the two . the two models provide results that are similar in magnitude . the curvatures are also similar , with small-differences at points quite distant from the current-discount of 6¢ . the losses in mailer-welfare , which are of course-opposite in sign from the profits , are substantially larger in magnitude than the profits . at a discount of 4¢ instead of 6¢ in the thress-model , the postal-service gain in profit is $ 562 million and the loss in mailer-welfare is $ 945 million . the lines made up of triangles show the net loss or gain of the other two curves . final conference copy thress-model 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 discount in dollars , current=.06 profit in squares , mailer-welfare in diamonds , net in triangles exe model 0 0.02 0.04 0.06

next-step is to relax the constraint that the basic-price is fixed and to allow discount-changes with the requirement that the postal-service remain at breakeven . due to insoluble-algebra , a simultaneous-solution is not possible . short of that , the preference would be to select d , express pb in terms of d and pws , and then express pws in terms of the desired net-revenue ( taken to be the same as the net-revenue at the base position- hence breakeven ) . this , however , is circular and , although convergence was sometimes obtained after a number of iterations , the procedure was found , for the most part , to be unworkable and sometimes unstable . in the alternative , the procedure adopted was to select d , express pb in terms of d and pws , and to use the backsolver-routine provided in lotus 1-2-3 to hunt for the value of pws that yields breakeven . within this approach , a number of steps were needed , as will be explained . given the new discount selected , the leaving-shift-volume can be calculated in the same way as in the above example on profits . the next-step is to recognize that since pb will be changing in this case , to allow breakeven , there will be a change in welfare in the basic-market . the following-graph shows the basic-market , before the shift-volume is allowed to leave . * vb vb this is a demand-curve , conditional on the constraint that the discount remains the same , under which condition no mailers will shift to workshared . the crosshatched-trapezoid is the welfare-loss to these mailers as a market , given that they can not shift . the welfare-effects on the mailers who shift are calculated in the same way as in the above section on profits . the shift-volume is allowed to grow according to an ownprice-elasticity of -0.189 and the user-costs are estimated in the same way . also , the welfare-effects in the workshare-market are calculated in the same way as before . for discount-increases ( and conversely for discount-decreases ) , the net-welfare is the sum of : ( a ) the reduction in welfare of the basic-market , before the shift-volume-leaves , ( b ) the increase in welfare of the shifting-volume , and ( c ) the increase in welfare of the workshare-market , before the shift-volume arrives . the technical-cost-effects , due to the work being done by a party that may do it at a higher cost , are also calculated in the same way as before . that is , the leaving-shift-volume , before it grows , is multiplied by the difference in the cost of doing the work . figure 3 shows the basic-results for the two models . the lines composed of boxes show the welfare-level of all mailers combined and the lines composed of diamonds show the technical-losses ( if negative ) of shifting the work to another party . figure 4 shows the supply-curve of workshare-services . in traditional-form , it has the discount on the vertical-axis . in the united states , considerable-attention is given to setting the worksharing-discounts . two approaches are often discussed . the first is the subclass-approach and the second is the rate-category-approach . in the subclass-approach , the basic and the workshare-category are each given a percentage-markup over cost , in order to obtain their average-rate . as a simple-example , suppose the cost of worksharing is 10¢ and the cost of basic-mail is 16¢ . if each is given a 50 % markup , the average-rate-levels will be 15¢ and 24¢ , respectively . in this case , the rate-difference is 9¢ , which is equal to the cost-difference of 6¢ inflated by the 50 % markup . thress-model 2 4 6 81012 discount , cents/piece , current level = 6.0 welf are in boxes , technical eff . in diamonds exe model 2 4 6 81012 discount , cents/piece , current level = 6.0

billions figure 4 in the rate-category-approach , the difference in the rates for the two categories is based on the cost-difference . assuming 100 % passthrough of the cost-difference , which is 6¢ in this example , the rate-difference would be 6¢ . handled in this way , the rates might turn out to be 17¢ and 23¢ . as discussions concerning-rate setting occur , considerable-attention is given to selecting the passthrough . the ( adjustable ) assumption of this paper is that the postal-service 's cost for doing the workshare-work is 6¢ and that 100 % of this 6¢ is passed through into rates . if the passthrough were over 100 % , a result for which some parties argue , the discount would be larger and we would say that we are moving from rate-category treatment toward subclass-treatment . if the two subclasses were given different-proportionate-markups , rather than the 50 % markups in the example just completed , the comparisons would not be so simple . in figure 3 , it is clear that as the discount-level is increased , implying a passthrough of over 100 % , the general-welfare level-increases , but at a declining-rate . the curves of both models appear to reach a maximum at a discount of about 8¢ . at the 8¢ level , the thress-model shows a welfare-gain of $ 32 million and the exe model of $ 27 million . at the same time , they show technical-losses , respectively , of $ 25 million and $ 29 million . it is interesting to look at the makeup of these welfare-gains . in the thress-model , at the discount-level of 8¢ and the net-gain of $ 32 million , the basic-market incurs a welfare-loss of $ 480 million ( 0.89¢ per piece ) , the workshare-market realizes a gain of $ 487 million ( 1.23¢ per piece ) , and the mailers who shift gain $ 25 million ( 1.0¢ per piece ) . the volume of mail shifting is 2.493 billion leaving basic and 2.507 arriving at the workshare-category . this is about 4.6 % of the basic-volume . at the 8¢ discount-level , the overall-volume in the system , basic plus workshared , increases 0.69 % . peter bernstein , testifying for the united states postal-service in docket no . r971 , prepared-estimates of welfare-gains under more efficient worksharing discounts.19 his analysis left some questions unanswered but pointed to efficient-discounts well above the 8¢ level and to gains on the order of several hundred million dollars . compared to his 19 directt-testimony of peter bernstein on behalf of united states postal-service , usps-t-1 , docket no . r97-1 , postal-rate commission , p. 93. estimates , the 8¢ level seems small , as does the gain of $ 32 million . in fact , the gain of $ 32 million is small by almost any standard . furthermore , achieving it places a burden on basic-mailers of $ 480 million , which is notably-large by almost any standard . in terms of pareto optimality , it appears that a change from the current-position imposes large-losses on some mailers , large-gains on others , and relatively-small net gains . the supply-curves of workshare-services , shown in figure 4 , are less informative . assuming they are valid around the current-discount level of 6¢ , they clearly show a good deal of sensitivity to the discount . at low-discounts , however , they still show more volume than might be expected ; and at high discount-levels , they show-supply-levels which are not as large as might be expected . a matter of considerable-discussion in the united states concerns whether the ( noshift ) own-price-elasticity of workshared-volume is greater than that of basic-volume , as these two categories are now constituted . the thress-model suggests that if the discount remains unchanged , and thus that shifting is not allowed , the elasticity of basic-volume is negative 0.189 and of workshared-volume is negative 0.289 . prior to thress ' work , information of this kind was not available . a natural-question becomes : how sensitive are the results to differences in the two elasticities ? figure 5 shows the basic-curves for a situation where both no-shift-elasticities are the same at -0.189 . it is clear that the efficient-discount moves closer to the cost-figure of 6¢ and that the welfare-gains become much smaller . specifically , in the thress-model , the peak occurs at a discount of 7¢ and the welfare-gain is only $ 6 million . the conclusion , then , is influenced strongly by whether the workshare-category is more elastic . the discussion surrounding-rate-category versus subclass-status often focuses on the strength of the cross-elasticities . in order to shed some light on this question , three special-runs on cross-elasticities were done . figure 6 shows the curves for a situation where the discount and cross-elasticities are zero , figure 7 for when the discount-elasticities are doubled , and figure 8 for when the discount-elasticities are doubled and the two no-shift-elasticities are equal to -0.189 . note that some of the scales on the vertical-axes are different on these plots . thress-model 2 4 6 81012 discount , cents/piece , current level = 6.0 welf are in boxes , technical eff . in diamonds exe model 2 4 6 81012 discount ,

the cross-elasticities are zero , substantial-welfare-gains are available from discounts larger than 6¢ and the optimal-discount appears to be well above 8¢ . as the cross-elasticities become larger , the efficient-discount-levels move closer to the ecp level and the associated welfare-gains available become quite small.20 and , when the no-shift-elasticities of the basic and workshared-product are the same , the gains become even smaller and the peak becomes very pronounced . these models are good only for small to moderate-movements from the current-position . for larger movements , a somewhat-different approach is taken , beginning in the next-section . 20 recall that under the assumptions made in this paper , setting the discount at 6 cents is the ecp position , where 6 cents is the cost-savings at the margin . thress-model 2 4 6 81012 discount , cents/piece , current level = 6.0 welf are in boxes , technical eff . in diamonds exe model 2 4 6 81012 discount , cents/piece ,

viewed in broader perspective from a base equilibrium-position of no worksharing-program being offered . then the question becomes : what would happen if the basic-price were held constant and a worksharing-program were begun ? the previous-section asked only about making-changes to an existing-program , and a well developed one at that . if no worksharing-discounts were being offered , it is possible that some mailers would still workshare . they could feel that the cost of the worksharing is small and that they receive an improvement in service . this could happen in presorting . another possibility is that they are worksharing without doing anything extra , such as in achieving-drop-shipment because they are already located at the destination . consider a program of discounts for presortation . initially , as a conservative-starting-point , suppose the postal-service is at breakeven with no discounts and no presort-volume . since many mailers have computerized-mailing-systems in place and have sufficient-volume , they can do presorting-work at a very low-cost . without hard-evidence , the author believes that a presort-discount of ¾ of a cent might induce as many as 20 billion presorted pieces . this is shown in the supply-curve in figure 9 . beyond ¾ of a cent , one would expect smaller mailers to begin presorting or that some presort-firms would begin to take the mail of highest quality and presort it with optical-character-readers , probably putting on a barcode at the same time . suggestions have been offered in the united states that the most attractive-customers of some presort-firms are being charged a price in the neighborhood of one cent per piece . the graph shows supply increasing up to 30 billion pieces at a discount of 3¢ . beyond 3¢ , less attractive-customers and relatively more difficult-mail would begin to convert to presort . in the neighborhood of 6¢ , the curve must align with the supply-curve found in the previous-part of this paper . the curve shown above is selected to align ( roughly ) with this requirement . as the discount-increases above 6¢ , it is clear from figure 4 that the curve will continue to rise . at some point , however , it is possible that private-industry would rise to the occasion and collect virtually all of the mail , process it , and give it to the postal-service for delivery . the curve , then , would turn nearly horizontal and the postal-industry , short of delivery , would be essentially privatized . these are interesting-possibilities . the other curve shown above , in triangles , is a curve of the cost to the postal-service of sorting the mail that begins to presort . what is shown is that the postal-service would spend approximately 4¢ per piece to sort and barcode the first 20 billion pieces . the postal-service does not have the option of sorting the mail on a computer before the address is printed . it must read the mail , look up the zip code for the address , spray on the barcode , and proceed to do the sorting , probably to the five digit-level . the way to think of the above curves is to begin with a discount , go over to the supply-curve to get a volume , and then go up to the postal-service cost-curve to see how much the postal-service saved on the last few pieces that converted to presort . above the first 20 billion pieces , less attractive-mail begins to presort and the postal-service 's costs at the margin undoubtedly begin to increase . they are shown increasing to 5¢ at a presort-volume of 30 billion and then increasing more slowly . at a presort-volume of 40 billion pieces , the postal-service 's cost-curve goes through the current-operating-point discussed in the previous-part of this paper . no evidence is available about the slope of the postal service's cost-curve at or above the 40-billion-piece level . for purposes of small-changes , it was assumed to be horizontal in the previous-part of this paper . almost undoubtedly , however , it has some positive slope . one reason for it to have a very low-slope is the advent in the united states of what is called remote video encoding . the mail , which can be anywhere from mildly-unattractive to rather difficult is put through a sorting-machine and a picture of it is taken . the picture appears on a computer-screen and an operator reads it and supplies the address to the computer . the computer supplies the zip code and the appropriate-barcode is sprayed on the piece . the piece is handled very efficiently from there on . the cost of this video-operation may function as an upper-limit for most of the mail . if this is the case , the cost-curve would turn almost-horizontal at the cost for this operation . if the above supply and cost-curves are accepted , what are the implications ? one can easily increase the discount from zero and , for each discount-level , calculate several-figures : ( 1 ) the total revenue lost by the postal-service , which is simply-equal to the discount-level multiplied by the presort-volume ; ( 2 ) the total-cost incurred by mailers or by mailing-organizations , which is the area under the supply-curve ; and ( 3 ) the total-savings of the postal-service because it does not have to do the sorting and processing , which is the area under the cost-curve . the difference between no . 3 and no . 1 is the increase in the profit ( net income ) of the postal-service . the difference between no . 3 and no . 2 is the technical-gain from have a lower cost-provider do the work . figure 10 shows the results . the line composed of boxes-shows the profit-position of the postal-service . as the discount-level ( on the horizontal-axis ) gets up to ¾ of a cent , 20 billion pieces become presorted . the postal-revenue-decreases by ¾ of a cent-times the 20 billion pieces , but the postal-cost-decreases by 4¢ time the 20 billion pieces . therefore , the profit-position of the postal-service increases to the tune of about $ 650 million and the technical-gain to the nation goes up to the same $ 650 million . since the basic-price ( for non-presorted-mail ) has not increased , no one has been made worse off . increasing the discount from zero to ¾ cent , then , was a pareto-optimal move . the postal-service is better off , no mailers are worse off , and the excess-money can be used to lower prices for all mailers . figure 10 as the discount is increased beyond ¾ of a cent , the postal-service 's profit-level-declines , but it is still positive . the losses from giving the higher discount to all of the mailers that are already presorting are large and the savings from the additional-presorting are small . according to the graph , the postal-service 's profit-level-declines until it is back at breakeven at discount of about 4.5¢ . additional-work , however , has been transferred to a lower cost-provider , causing a technical-gain of about one billion dollars . this is a substantial-gain from offering a presort-program , and it accrues entirely to the mailers . again , the move from offering no discount to offering a discount of 4.5¢ is a pareto-optimal-move-no one is worse off and someone is substantially better off . as the discount-increases above 4.5¢ , the postal-service falls below breakeven and will have to make up the losses with a price-increase for all mailers , both those who are now presorting and those who have not thus far been affected . a move from offering no presort-program to offering a discount greater than 4.5¢ , then , is not pareto-optimal . note , however , that up to a discount of 6¢ , by the assumption made in this paper , work continues to be shifted to a lower cost-provider , but the total technical-gains beyond a discount of 2 or 3 cents are very small . this is because we are in a range where the cost to mailers ( or their agents ) is approximately-equal to that of the postal-service . as shown in the previous-part of this paper , however , the general net-welfare-level of the nation continues to increase to some discount above 6¢ . what is happening to bring about this net-increase is that some mailers are being made better off and some are being made worse off . further empirical-work along these lines might be difficult . data such as those in figure 9 are not readily-available and would be difficult to develop . it seems clear , however , that substantial gains are available from presort-programs and , by extension , from other worksharing-programs , to a point . beyond that point , many considerations need to be balanced in order to decide on the appropriate-discount-levels . various-statements of the ecp rule can now be reviewed . the first statement suggests that the rate-difference be set equal to the simple-cost-difference . in the model discussed in part ii above , the cost of basic-mail is 26.1¢ and of workshared-mail is 10.6¢ . the difference of 15.5¢ is clearly-due to much more than worksharing and is much larger than any savings . a discount of 15.5¢ would not make sense . the second statement is that the rate-difference should be equal to the average incremental-savings for the worksharing-program . this would lead to the discount of 4.5¢ , which is where the lines cross in figure 9 . the third-statement is that the workshare-price should equal the marginal-cost of the workshared-product plus the unit-opportunity-cost of the program . the size of this figure would depend on how much the shift-volume grows after it leaves the basic-category . no estimate of this is available but if the growth is high , the postal-service-loss for the program could be low , which would yield a discount larger than 4.5¢ . the fourth-statement is to set the discount equal to the savings at the margin . this leads to the current-discount of 6¢ , which is where the lines in figure 9 cross . although the lines in figure 9 appear to cross , based on the models in part ii , it is interesting to consider the possibility that they may not . suppose ecp at the margin could be pursued with full-knowledge of the effects . we might increase the discount to 7¢ and find that we saved 7.3¢ on the volume that shifted . then we might increase it to 8¢ and find that we saved 8.2¢ on the volume that shifted . then we might increase it further . if this process continued , it might lead to a situation where all of the collection , sorting , and transporting of the mail is privatized . the reader is left to consider the desirability of such a result . part iv : some concluding-observations 1 . in the sense that the responses drawn from mailers by worksharing-discounts are based on a wide-range of factors , including the consideration of factors that are not tied in any particular way to the basis for the discount , there are many types of worksharing . assessing the advocacy of offering the discounts should include consideration of these factors . some of the types of worksharing-situations are discussed in part i of this paper . 2 . from the current-position , if the price of the basic-mail service is fixed and the discount for presorting can be varied , there is a powerful-profit-incentive for the postal-service in the united states to reduce the presort-discounts . and , importantly , the associated-losses in mailer-welfare are on the order of twice the increase in postal-profits ( net income ) . 3 . for small to moderate-movements from the current-position in the united states for first-class-mail , the technical-costs associated with not having the low-cost-provider do the work and the net-welfare-gains ( or losses ) appear to be small compared to the associated-welfare-effects , plus and minus , on the mailer groups involved . specific-estimates are provided in part ii . 4 . when cross-elasticities are substantial , the welfare-gains are small for setting worksharing-discounts larger than 100 % of the savings at the margin , which is the traditional ecp position . further , the maximum-welfare-position may not involve a passthrough of much more than 100 % . 5 . the `` make-or-buy-decision '' is not a productive way to look at worksharing-discounts . allowing a discount to be set in this way would allow it to be based on profit-maximization by the postal-service . it is easy to argue that this discount for first-class-mail in the united states might be in the neighborhood of ¾ cent . if large-mailers can `` presort '' the mail for ¾ of a cent and the postal-service saves 4¢ , there is no profit-reason for offering a larger discount . 6 . introducing a presort-program and increasing the discount until a pareto-optimal position is reached will result in a much smaller discount than basing the discount on the savings at the margin . the pareto-optimal discount may be in the range of 4.5¢ , while the savings at the margin appear to be in the neighborhood of 6¢ . 7 . the welfare-findings and the advocacy of ecp are affected strongly by the magnitude of attendant-cross-elasticities and by whether the no-shift-own-price-elasticities of the workshared-product are larger , the same , or smaller than those of the basic-product . it goes without saying that the estimation of these elasticities is difficult and that the ones we have may not be highly-accurate . technical appendix the text of this paper is in microsoft word 6.0/7.0 . with the graphs , the main-file is about 2.4mb . it is most
