united states general-accounting-office executive-guide gao february 2001 maximizing the success of chief-information-officers learning from leading-organizations gao-01-376g preface information technology ( it ) has become integral to providing government-services , and the management of information in the federal government has moved out of the back office and off the mainframe into the home and office and onto the internet . as the federal government fully embraces e-commerce and other leading-edge implementations of it that benefit citizens , leadership in managing the government«s information-resources becomes of paramount-importance . the development of new service-approaches and the enhancement of old ones in this new information-era require the active-participation of information-management-organizations from the beginning . the efficient , effective , and innovative-use of information technology requires a level of leadership and focus that goes beyond what would be provided in a technical-support-function . congress recognized the need for greater leadership in information-management and technology in the clinger-cohen act of 1996 , which mandated the position of chief-information-officer ( cio ) for executive-departments and agencies . this act and other laws define the general-responsibilities of the cio and many of the processes required to manage information in the federal government . virtually all of the major-executive-agencies have appointed cios , and many have taken positive-steps toward the implementation of important-information management-processes specified by law . to reap the full-benefits of information-management-reform , federal-agencies must utilize the full-potential of cios as information-management-leaders and active-participants in the development of agency strategic-plans and policies . the cios themselves must meet the challenges of building credible-organizations , and developing and organizing-information management-capabilities to meet agency-mission needs . this guide is intended to assist federal-agencies in maximizing the success of cios . principles and practices gleaned from the case-studies presented in our guide offer concrete suggestions on what agency-executives can do to ensure the effectiveness of their cio organizations . the guide does not address all of the responsibilities which fall to federal-agency-cios - only those which have parallels in the private sector . moreover , we find that practices used by federal-agency-cios tend to differ from those used by leading-organizations . we did not study the reasons for these deviations specifically , but they likely-result from the context in which federal-cios operate . both operational and structural-aspects of the cio«s environment can vary significantly in the federal-sector versus the private sector . rather than dwell on differences , our study shows that there is much common-ground between public and private cio organizations on which to build efforts for improvement . the specific-key-conditions and strategies described in this guide can be used as suggestions for federal-cios to apply or adapt to their environments , where appropriate . we would like to thank the private sector council and the leading-practice-organizations we selected for our study , which are listed on page 59 , for providing us with the information about their practices and assisting us in producing this executive-guide . we would like to thank members of gao«s executive council on information-management and technology for their comments and suggestions in the development of this guide . we would also like to thank the individuals who provided helpful-comments on the exposure-draft of this guide.1 this guide was prepared under the direction of lester diamond , assistant director , information-technology-management issues , who can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-7957 or

maximizing the success of chief-information-officers ( exposure-draft ) ( gao/aimd-00-83 , march 31 , 2000 ) . contents page federal-information management-reform the rapid-pace of technological-change and innovation in the current-information-age poses wide-ranging-opportunities for improved information management2 and enhanced-performance in achieving-agency-missions and goals . at the same time , however , the proliferation of technology has brought with it a range of thorny issues surrounding managing and integrating complex-processes , computer-equipment , and telecommunications-networks . in its oversight-role , congress has established a series of laws to define the role of information-management in government and to mandate basic-processes to manage the government-information-technology ( it ) investment . this section provides a brief-overview of that legislative-history . the federal government«s management of its information-resources to date has produced mixed-results . consistent with reform-legislation , agencies have taken constructive-steps to implement modern it strategies , systems , and management-practices and policies directed toward achieving-cost-savings , increasing productivity , and improving the timeliness and quality of federal service-delivery . to the extent that the nearly $ 27 billion in annual planned-obligations for information technology can be invested and managed more wisely , federal-programs will operate more effectively and at less cost . for years , congress has been working to increase the effectiveness of information and technology-management in the federal government . an early-effort was the brooks act , enacted in 1965 , which called for centralized-oversight of federal-information-technology acquisitions by the general services administration ( gsa ) . the paperwork reduction act of 1980 ( pra ) applied-life-cycle management-principles to information-management and focused on reducing the government«s information-collection-burden . to help accomplish this , pra designated senior-information-resources manager-positions in the major-departments and agencies with responsibility for a wide-range of functions including-information resource-planning , budgeting , organizing , controlling , training , and ensuring the absence of duplication in information-systems . pra also created the office of information and regulatory affairs within the office of management and budget ( omb ) to provide central-oversight of information-management-activities across the federal government . in the 1990s , congress enacted additional-laws holding-agencies accountable for effective-management of public-information resources . in particular , the chief financial-officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and the government-management reform act of 1994 spelled out an ambitious-agenda to remedy the government«s lack of useful , relevant , timely , and reliable financial information . for the government«s major-departments and agencies , these laws ( 1 ) established-senior-level cfo-positions , ( 2 ) required annual financial-statement-audits , and ( 3 ) set-expectations for more modern-systems to support integrated-management of budget , accounting , and program-information . the government-performance and results act of 1993√ commonly known as gpra or the results act √required that agencies set strategic-goals , measure-performance toward those goals , and report on their progress . effective-implementation of the results act hinges on agencies« ability to produce meaningfully integrated information to manage performance and measure-results . in this guide , information-management refers to all aspects of the management of all information-resources , including-technology , funds , human-capital , and management-processes , as well as the underlying-information . it refers to technology used to support the management of information . further , amendments to the pra in 1995 required that agencies indicate in strategic-information resources management-plans how they are applying-information-resources to improve the productivity , efficiency , and effectiveness of government-programs , including-improvements in the delivery of services to the public . with this increased focus on agency-accountability also came recognition of the need to elevate the agencies« information-management positions to more strategic , executive , levels , comparable to the cfo-positions created in 1990 . the clinger-cohen act of 1996 amended the pra , renaming and elevating former information-resources manager-positions to executive-level cios who report directly to the agency-head and have information-management as a primary-responsibility . the new information-management-leaders are accountable for not only the range of information-management-activities outlined in the pra , but also for more strategic it functions such as developing-architectures , managing-portfolios , and measuring the performance of information technology-investments . among other things , the clinger-cohen act also ( 1 ) required senior-executive-involvement in it decision-making , ( 2 ) imposed much-needed-discipline in acquiring and managing-technology resources , ( 3 ) called for the redesign of inefficient-work processes before investing in technology , and ( 4 ) repealed the brooks act , eliminating gsa«s central-acquisition-authority . primary-procurement-responsibility now rests directly with federal-agencies . together with a number of other laws enacted over the past several years to foster improvements in such areas as financial-management , acquisition , and computer-security , this legislation discussed above composes a statutory-framework for achieving performance-based-management and accountability in not just information-management , but overall federal management.3 ( appendix i provides a list of these key federal-laws affecting-information management . ) as the executive-leaders for information and technology-management , federal-cios have a key role in helping their agencies fulfill many of the provisions embodied in this management-reform-framework . even with the guidance provided by omb for establishing the new information-technology-management leadership-positions , agencies face distinct-challenges in effectively-positioning federal-cios and supporting-organizations to ensure that information-management adds value in their business/mission performance .4 cios in the federal-sector face structural and cultural-hurdles generally not found elsewhere . some of these additional-challenges are described in the final-section of this guide . 3 managing for results : the statutory-framework for performance-based-management and accountability ( gao/ggd/aimd-98-52 , january 28 , 1998 ) and managing for results : the statutory-framework for improving federal-management and effectiveness ( gao/t-ggd/aimd-97-144 , june 24 , 1997 ) . 4 omb guidance on implementing federal cio-positions includes memorandum for the heads of executive-departments and establishments , ƒimplementation of the information-technology-management reform act of 1996 , ≈ m-96-20 , april 4 , 1996 ; and memorandum for the president«s management council , ƒwhat makes a good cio ? , ≈ june 28 , 1996 . overview of fundamental-principles the basis for this guide is the belief that federal-agencies could benefit from examples set by a few leading-organizations whose cio organizations have gained a reputation for outstanding information-management in their enterprises . this work is intended to provide pragmatic-guidance that federal-agencies can consider in determining how best to integrate cio functions into their respective-organizations . our target-audience includes senior federal-executives and managers , although our observations can also provide insights for senior-information management-officials throughout the public and private-sectors . ( appendix ii provides more details on the objectives , scope , and methodology of our work . ) based on interviews with private-sector and state-cios and other research , we have developed a framework of critical-success-factors and leading-principles . the balance of this guide describes this framework and its application to cios in the federal government . cios of leading-organizations we interviewed described a consistent-set of key-principles of information-management that they believed contributed to the successful-execution of their responsibilities . these principles-touch on specific-aspects of their organizational-management such as formal and informal relationships among the cio and others , business-practices and processes , and critical cio functions and leadership-activities . the specific-nature of these principles varied depending on the organization«s mission , size , culture , and other factors , but each underlying key-principle was consistently-observed . the cios interviewed considered these principles instrumental because they address critical organizational and operational-aspects of the cio«s role . notably , the principles address senior executives« responsibility for creating an effective-management context for their cios , as well as the cios« responsibilities for building-credibility and organizing-information-technology and management to meet business-needs . the practices are not new ideas in the general-management of organizations , but rather are the application of well-founded-principles in the maturing-area of information technology and management . these principles are most effective when implemented together in a mutually reinforcing-manner . as ad hoc efforts , each individual principle addresses a single-aspect that is necessary , but is not sufficient for success by itself . the failure to execute a single principle may render the others less effective . further , although there is no precedence among the principles , organizational conditions may make it more feasible to address one principle before another . for example , the chief-executive-officer ( ceo ) may ƒposition the cio for success≈ in advance of hiring a new cio while the other principles await the cio«s attention . figure 1 illustrates the six fundamental-principles described by the cios interviewed during the development of this guide . in addition , for each principle , several key-characteristics of organizations that successfully execute these principles are listed . these key-characteristics can provide insights into what constitutes successful cio organizations . figure 1 : six principles and key-characteristics of cio management in leading-organizations evaluating the intent of the six principles , we observed that they naturally fell into three distinct-sets , which we refer to as critical-success-factors . figure 2 illustrates the six principles and their relationship with the three critical-success-factors and their respective organizational-foci . figure 2 : critical-success-factors and organizational-relationships critical-success-factors principles organizational-foci a coo-chief-operating-officer understanding the six principles in terms of critical-success-factors is particularly-useful because of characteristics that are shared by principles within the same success-factor . following is a brief-description of each critical-success-factor . align information-management-leadership for value creation the principles under the first critical-success-factor , ƒalign information-management-leadership for value creation , ≈ advocate the need to recognize the role of information-management in creating-value and positioning the cio for success ; both of these principles address-issues of senior-executive-support . both principles require that the leaders of the enterprise embrace the critical-role information-management can play in the success of the organization and the leadership-role the cio must play in order for information technology and management to meet its potential . the first principle addresses the acceptance of this premise by senior-executive-management , and the second ensures that the cio has the organizational-legitimacy to execute his or her role . promote organizational-credibility while the first success-factor refers to legitimacy at a strategic-planning-level , this success-factor addresses a more operational-level . the principle that addresses the need to ensure the credibility of the cio organization and the principle that encourages measuring-success and demonstrating-results , if executed successfully , will lead to the confidence of those with operational-responsibility in the enterprise . without credibility , the cio organization will struggle to be accepted as a full-participant in the development of new organizational-systems and processes . execute cio responsibilities the last critical-success-factor , ƒexecute cio responsibilities≈ addresses the need to organize information-resources to meet business-needs and to develop the associated human-capital . these two principles provide the foundation for the cio«s effectiveness in carrying out the cio organization«s specific-responsibilities . once executive-management endorses the centrality of the cio organization and becomes a partner in the development of new systems , the cio organization must execute its responsibilities successfully . the last-section in figure 2 , ƒorganizational foci , ≈ illustrates how both principles within a single critical-success-factor require the same organizational-units to collaborate in their execution . both principles within a critical-success-factor also focus on the same organizational-units as targets of their implementation . for example , in the case of , ƒpromote organizational-credibility , ≈ both principles rely on the collaboration of senior executives and division-heads for success and have as their target the senior management of the enterprise . the common-features within a critical-success-factor can become especially-significant as the cio , and other players , plan the execution of the six principles described in this guide . as this group plans its strategy , it can utilize the commonality among principles to link initiatives and utilize the synergy between related-efforts . for example , while organizing-information resources to meet enterprise-needs and developing human-capital are distinct-initiatives , they share extensive-areas of commonality . executing both principles in page 10 gao-01-376g cio executive-guide conjunction with each other can create opportunities for efficiency and effectiveness not otherwise-available . finally , the organization of principles into critical-success-factors illustrates the extent to which the work of a successful cio must extend throughout the enterprise . in particular , the role that the ceo and other senior-managers play in ensuring the success of the cio should be noted . while it is the responsibility of the cio to execute the specific-responsibilities of his or her position , it became clear to us during our case-studies that the successful cio relies extensively on both vertical and horizontal relationships within the enterprise in order to carry out these responsibilities . this executive-guide includes examples from our case-study-organizations as well as information from selected federal-organizations , which helped us confirm the applicability of our findings to federal-government-experience . at the conclusion of each principle , we provide a case-study to describe the principle in practice at one of the organizations we visited , as well as strategies to consider when implementing the principle . although this guide focuses on fundamental-practices rather than detailed-guidance , the examples illustrate and complement much of the specific-guidance contained in similar and related gao documents cited in appendix iii . the federal cio environment today the cio-position in the federal government is still evolving . agencies are learning how a cio can help improve effectiveness and efficiency and better realize the benefits of their information-resources . current federal-cios are learning how to carry out their responsibilities in the federal-environment with all of the incumbent-expectations and constraints . both the agencies and the cios are working to meet the letter and intent of the clinger-cohen act and associated legislation effectively . the principles offered in this guide are intended to provide insight into what cios at leading-organizations consider critical to their success , and provide advice to federal-cios and senior-agency-management as they work to improve the use of information technology and management in the federal government . the federal cio faces an environment that includes many of the elements encountered by cios interviewed for this guide . at the same time , the federal cio faces additional-challenges as a result of specific legislative-responsibilities ( e.g. , records-management and defined-contracting-requirements ) . the federal cio is also subject to a funding-process that is more complex and uncertain than in most other organizations . the effect of the appropriations-process and the highly distributed management-structures found in several federal-agencies tend to move some of the control of processes having to do with information-management away from the cio . together , these characteristics , among others , differentiate the federal cio environment from other environments . these differences , and their impact on the framework developed in this guide , will be discussed in the ƒusing this guide≈ section . the following-discussion focuses on the common-elements among the private , state , and federal-sectors , and the application of the framework across all three . in a series of one-on-one-interviews with half of the federal cio council , we found that federal-organizations face many of the same issues as their private-sector and state government counterparts . specifically , federal-organizations must overcome the challenges of effectively linking-information-technology and management to agency-missions , positioning and legitimizing information-management-leadership , measuring-performance , and building-capabilities and skills . our meeting with five members of the federal small agency cio council and a number of independent studies provide similar conclusions.5 the six principles that emerged from our discussions with private-sector and state government-cios also describe the general-areas that federal-cios agreed needed to be addressed . however , the specific-approaches to executing those principles tended to differ among the various sectors . the federal chief-information-officer : third annual top ten challenges survey , association for federal-information resources management , november , 1998 ; implementing best-practices , capital-planning and it investment committee , federal cio council , june 1998 ; the impact of change : clinger-cohen act implementation , laying the foundation for year 2000 and beyond , eighth annual itaa survey of federal-cios , grant thornton llp , december 1997 ; and iac/cio task-force draft-report , federal chief information officer«s working-group and industry advisory council , july 9 , 1996 . in three of the principle-areas , the level to which practices of leading private versus federal-organizations have evolved is significantly-different . for example , in principle i , while leading-organizations generally include their cios in executive-business decisionmaking , in the federal government setting-information management is still often viewed as a support-function rather than a strategic-activity . leading-organizations also consider various leadership-models and position their cios at a clear , executive-level , as in principle ii . in contrast , federal cio implementation is in more nascent-stages , lacking-criteria for matching cio types with organizational-needs . further , in principle v , while leading-organizations are flexible in reassigning-staff and structuring capabilities across business and technology-lines , federal-staffing practices and organizational-structures are less flexible in nature . performance-measurement ( principle iv ) and information-management human-capital-development ( principle vi ) are two areas that private , state , and federal-cios all agreed must be addressed in order for the cio and the supporting-organization to be successful . practices used by both the private and public-sectors in the area of performance-measurement are still evolving . in both performance-measurement and human-capital-development , practices used by the federal-cios differed from those of cios in leading-organizations , though federal-cios were actively trying to address the issues . differences in the approaches used probably resulted from specific-constraints in the federal cio environment , including a focus on nonfinancial-program-benefits , rather than financial return on investments . credibility-building , principle iii , is the one area in which cios in both the public and private sector have all adopted similar-practices . the precise-application of the practices depended on the specific-contexts of their organizations , but the approaches were consistent . it may be noted that this is one of the few principles that cios may address themselves , without regard to organizational constraints or ceo support . of course , as stated earlier , the effectiveness of this principle is moderated by the extent to which the other principles have been implemented . the following-table summarizes the practices of our sample organizations in each principle-area and compares them with practices in the federal cio environment . table 1 : comparison of leading-practices and federal cio management-practices in terms of critical-success-factors , federal cio organizations tend to trail the cios interviewed for this guide in the ƒalign information-management-leadership for value creation≈ and ƒexecute cio responsibilities≈ factors . the successful-execution of these two critical-success-factors depends to a great-extent on officials other than the cio . in the first success-factor , the cio depends to a great-extent on the other senior-executive-officers to support the inclusion of the cio in critical strategic-discussions . in the other factor , the federal cio tends to be constrained by organizational-attributes typical of the federal-sector . these attributes include , but are not limited to , relatively-little flexibility in financial-reward-systems and highly distributed organizational-structures in a number of federal-agencies . this is not to say that there are no examples of progress in the federal-sector in either of these two success-factors . the federal response to the year 2000-computing-challenge created an opportunity in many agencies for cio and program-organizations to partner in responding to specific-agency-mission needs . this partnering took place at the senior-executive-level and contributed to the success of the federal y2k effort . in addition , the cio council , the office of personnel-management , and individual-agencies have been working together to develop new approaches to compensating and retaining-information-technology and management-workers . it is interesting to note that the remaining critical-success-factor , ƒpromote organizational-credibility , ≈ is executed about the same within all sectors , since all sectors approach principle iii similarly , and no sector executes principle iv well . as noted , it is within this critical-success-factor that the cio is able to operate with the greatest individual-flexibility . table 1 indicates that a gap exists between the practices of federal-cios and cios of leading-organizations . areas in which gaps exist should be examined carefully to understand the basis for the differences as well as opportunities for greater implementation of the principles . it is possible that the business-context for federal-cios is sufficiently-different from that of cios in leading-organizations that lessons learned may not be applicable . some of these differences are described in the final-section of this guide . at the same time , an understanding of the information technology and management-practices of leading-organizations could contribute to the development of improved cio management-practices in the federal-sector . the following-sections describe each of the general-principles and practices discovered in our work with leading cio organizations . critical-success-factors principles organizational-foci critical-success-factor 1 : align information-management-leadership for value creation the cio and supporting-organization must have active-support and commitment at the very top of the enterprise or they will remain limited and tangential to the business , despite their potential contribution to mission-accomplishment . this first critical-success-factor focuses on the role of the senior-executive of the enterprise in developing a culture that includes the cio in senior-level-decision-making and that assumes the potential of it in creating-value for the enterprise . executive-leadership is essential to the successful-execution of this factor . a common theme among the cios we interviewed was that the message of the importance of it to the organization must be communicated at the highest levels . senior executives must embrace the central-role of technology , and the cio must be a full participating-member at the table with them as business strategy is discussed . this behavior begins with the ceo , who sets the example for senior and mid-level-executives and , through them , the rest of the organization . in addition , the participation of the cio in long-range strategic-planning is necessary to take full-advantage of the opportunities it can provide and to ensure that the technology-infrastructure is in place as business-strategies develop . principle i : recognize the role of information-management in creating-value ƒthe cio«s ability to add value is the biggest single-factor in determining whether the organization views it as an asset or a liability.≈ instituting an effective cio organization does not start with selection or placement of an information technology and management-leader , nor does it begin with establishing a structure for managing-information-resources and activities . rather , it begins with consideration on the part of executive-level-managers of the role of it and how vital it is to accomplishing-mission-objectives . it also entails thinking about ways to incorporate the information technology and management-leader in the executive-level-management structure and create an environment that facilitates business/technology sharing and exchange of ideas . moreover , ceos and governors can set powerful-examples through their own strong relationships with cios . such relationships symbolize the importance of information technology and management within their organizations . key-characteristics senior executives have primary-responsibility for setting the business-context for their cios and formulating-strategies for integrating-information-technology and management into their business-operations . executives of leading-organizations no longer regard-technology-management as a separate-support-function and instead strive to understand how investments in information-resources are made and how they integrate with other investments and the overall-business-vision . these executives also increasingly focus on the management , operations , program and service-delivery benefits , and performance of their major strategic-information systems . ceos have a key role in setting the example for the rest of the agency to follow in seeking to understand information technology and management-concepts and appreciating the strategic role that information technology and management can play in helping to accomplish business-objectives . viewing-information and technology not just as assets to manage , these ceos assign their information technology and management-leaders a prominent-role in business-decision making . recognizing the business-transformation potential of it , these executives also position their cios as change-agents with responsibility for applying-technology to achieve major-improvements in fundamental-business-processes and operations . with ceo support , the cios are in a good-position to have significant impact on not just it , but the entire-business enterprise . following the ceo«s lead , members of the senior-executive-team learn to value the advice of the cio in setting-business-directions and developing-strategies for improving organizational-capabilities and competitiveness . they seek to embrace fundamental-information technology and management-principles and work with their cios to develop a shared-vision of the role of it within the business-context . they engage in dialogue on page 18 gao-01-376g cio executive-guide ways that technology can be incorporated to improve business-processes , outputs , and outcomes . they incorporate information-management as an intrinsic-part of their business-planning and decision-making processes , discussing the benefits and risks associated with specific-strategies for improving-service , reducing cycle-time , or reducing-costs . in leading-organizations , senior-managers make joint-decisions on information-resources , formulate-business-plans , and set performance-expectations . increasingly , managers make it investment-decisions based on the value of the investments to their enterprises , not just to a specific-business-unit or function . by asking strategic and operational-questions at the beginning of the planning and evaluation-period , senior-managers gain a better understanding of the potential-benefits and value of it . information and technology-managers in leading-organizations are also adopting-processes that help them quantify and align projects with their organizations« business-planning and measurement processes . they produce plans that link to overall-business-plans and assign managers to act as liaisons between business units and cio organizations . increasingly , managers also focus on measuring reliability , responsiveness , and customer satisfaction , which in the eyes of senior management are just as important as strictly financial measures . leading-organizations work to create environments that are conducive to sharing-ideas on how information technology can support the businesses and vice versa . they adopt formal-mechanisms and structures that facilitate the ability of their businesses and information technology and management-leaders to understand and communicate one another«s issues and work together to accomplish a shared business-vision . these mechanisms and structures include forums , councils , and boards for discussion and exchange on business and technology-issues . such forums help promote organizationwide-perspective and facilitate the ability to achieve consensus or stakeholder-buy-in to business/technology directions . for example , one state has a strategic-planning-forum that brings together major-stakeholders statewide to identify strategic and tactical-issues , including it issues confronting the state . the state prepares a strategic-planning-document based on this stakeholder-input . this process has helped to integrate information-management into overall-business-planning by aligning it products and services with business-functions and linking-technology to the state«s overall strategic-direction . to further support the business/technology collaboration , leading-organizations adopt a common-business-language , skillfully avoiding technical-jargon and instead using-language that general managers and legislatures can understand . they use analogies , terminology , and processes that help fuse business and technology interests and ideas together . other strategies for business/technology learning include informal-activities such as newsletters , presentations , reports , and service-level-results placed in common-areas to communicate the effectiveness of their cio organizations . leading-organizations further the two-way exchange of ideas and perspectives by bringing in experts from the field to advise or educate managers on recent-trends and developments in both the business and technology-arenas . realizing that attitudes , expectations , and culture seldom change quickly , they plan for whatever time and resources are necessary to create a common-ground and organizational-cohesiveness . their efforts go a long way in shoring up commitment from across the organization to strategies for achieving common-goals . leading-organizations also focus on hiring-managers who bring a hybrid of business and technical-expertise to the organization . one large multinational-corporation uses ƒtechnical facilitators≈ to support its initiatives . in the past , this company had experienced problems in sharing-information-resources . managers in the different-lines of business were unwilling to share information-resources because each felt his or her particular-line of business was unique . because technology was becoming critical to future-success in this business-sector , top-managers were increasingly assigned to support and manage the company«s internal-information management-functions . several of the managers assigned had both business and technology-acumen and had the ability to raise business-issues from a technical-perspective in a nonthreatening manner . in resolving-business-issues , they were sometimes-able to identify more efficient technical-opportunities . case-study : recognizing the role of information-management in creating-value due to changes in market conditions and requirements for increased productivity through using common-components , a large manufacturing-company decided that it needed to make major-changes in the way it managed it to support the business . the company had outsourced its information-management-function , but lacked the infrastructure to provide strategic-direction , discipline , and overall-management of information-management to ensure optimal implementation and cost . given this situation , the company was faced with a proliferation of legacy-systems and inefficient business-processes built around them . the company also met with bureaucratic-business-resistance to change to a common-information systems-environment . by way of improvement , senior executives adopted a new it strategic-direction and focus that tracked back to the company«s business priorities¬ ƒcommon , lean and fast , global , and growth.≈ senior management then hired a cio as a change-agent , reporting to the vice chairman and the company«s senior decision-making council , and gave him responsibility for transforming the it function , thereby making him an enabler of the function and an integral part of the business strategy . the cio recruited an it management team that understood both the business and technical-sides of the enterprise . he instituted a matrix-management-organization , creating a leadership-structure that provided flexibility for meeting future-information-management needs as well as maintaining existing it systems . the new it organization became responsible for such strategic-activities as participating in the development of overall-business-strategies ; prioritizing it requirements ; generating it business-plans ; setting technical and architectural-standards ; managing-user-interfaces , outsourcing-contracts , suppliers , and systems-engineering ; and allocating it resources . to assess performance , the it organization instituted several-sets of measures that link directly to the business-objectives and priorities defined by the ceo in the company«s strategic-plan . the major-steps that the company took to improve , are illustrated in figure 3 , below . figure 3 : steps for transforming business-operations using-information-management • defined strategic-business-priorities including common , lean , fast , global and growth • executive-team shared a challenging-vision of the role of it • implemented a matrix it organization ( functional and operational-alignment ) • established virtual organizational-structure for flexibility and responsiveness strategies to consider instituting-information-technology and management as a support-function separate from the business is an ineffective and outdated model . leading-organizations recognize the role of it in supporting mission-accomplishment and seek to integrate it with business-operations . the following outlines the strategies that senior executives in leading-organizations commonly use to promote information-management-leadership involvement in business-decision making and maximize the benefits from their it investments . focus on efforts to incorporate the cio organization into the overall-business by • ensuring-executive-leadership and commitment for the cio organization , both at the career and political-levels ; • embracing the cio as a full-participant of the executive-management-team ; • developing structured-approaches for exploring the broad-range of opportunities and strategies in information technology available to enhance the business ; and • focusing-technology-initiatives on creating-value and providing the information needed by internal and external customers . provide an atmosphere that supports executive-understanding of it by • creating and using formal and informal-executive communication-channels to make the business-case for integrating-information management into organizationwide-decision-making ; and • emphasizing-returns and metrics that clearly-link information-management with an organization«s business-needs . principle ii : position the cio for success ƒthere is no cookie-cutter-approach , so knowing what fits in an organization is key to finding the right cio to match with the organization.≈ there is no one right way to establish a cio-position . diversities in corporate-missions , structures , cultures , and capabilities prohibit a prescriptive-approach to information-management-leadership . there are nonetheless a number of practices and alternative-strategies that senior executives in leading-organizations use to help define and institute their cio-positions to effectively meet business-needs . this section examines those practices , providing pragmatic-guidance that other organizations can also consider in determining how best to integrate cio functions into their respective-organizations . key-characteristics senior executives in leading-organizations recognize that a one-size-fits-all-solution to establishing-information-management leadership does not exist . rather , they take responsibility for ensuring that their cio-models are consistent with the business , technical , and cultural-contexts of their enterprises . executives do so by examining their internal-environments and asking a series of questions about the problems that need fixing , how information technology and management can help , and how a cio might best-fit within their management-structures to guide technology-solutions . the answers to these questions help them choose from a range of alternative cio approaches . specifically , by defining mission improvement objectives , senior executives determine whether their organization needs a cio who is a networking/marketing specialist , business-change-agent , operations-specialist , policy/oversight manager , or any combination thereof . studying existing it capabilities helps define the structure and responsibilities of the new cio organization . considering the centralized or decentralized-nature of the enterprise helps determine the corporate cio«s authority-level and how the cio shares-responsibility with other managers across the agency . further , appreciating organizational-culture and change readiness helps define the pace and extent to which cios can accomplish business-transformation . business-executives keep in mind that initial cio-models adopted should not be set in stone , but may have to be adjusted over time as their enterprises grow or mature . for example , while a company may need a business-strategist to build a new it capability , over time another type of cio may be better suited to sustaining operations . this evolution in the cio role is also reflected by the introduction of variant-leadership-positions in information-management ( i.e. , chief-knowledge-officers or chief technical officers ) that diffuse-responsibility across several-senior-level managers . for example , one industry-organization that we visited has multiple product line cios . the most senior-information management-executive positioned at a level above these cios asserts that he is not the ƒcorporate cio≈ and does not want to be . with the belief that one person can not embody all the knowledge needed to effectively direct-information-technology and management in an organization , this executive uses an executive-level-technology committee as a forum for building-consensus for it initiatives . in conjunction with determining their cio-models , senior executives clearly define up front the roles , responsibilities , and accountability of their cios for enterprisewide-information management , better enabling their cios to operate effectively within the parameters of their positions vis-à-vis those of their senior-management-counterparts ( i.e. , cfo , coo ) . typically , cios serve as a bridge between top-managers , it professionals , and end-users . cios provide leadership and vision , focusing senior executives on highvalue information-technology-issues , investments , and decisions . they may also serve as business-change-agents , challenging conventional-approaches and developing new methods and systems for delivering-mission-benefits . the case-study at the end of this section provides an example of a cio hired specifically to help transform information-management and business-operations . in this strategic-capacity , cios take the lead-role in integrating-information and technology-management and performance across the entire-information life-cycle . they are responsible for such activities as planning , setting-standards and policies , and designing and managing-architectures to guide introduction of technology-products and services . while not all cios necessarily have hands-on-responsibility , their purview may also incorporate any or all of the operational-elements of information and technology-management , such as data-processing , infrastructure management , and systems-acquisition . senior executives provide their cios with the authority they need to effectively carry out their diverse-responsibilities . executives ensure this by giving the cio a key role in it investment-decision-making , providing-budget-control , or ensuring leadership-backing for information technology and management programs and initiatives . formally documenting or , in the case of public-sector-organizations , legislating , cio roles and responsibilities can help in managing-performance and expectations of both the enterprise and the cio . for example , the position of one state-government-cio that we interviewed was based on a specific-statute establishing the cio at the cabinet-level and assigning clear-cut-responsibilities for funding and overseeing it operations statewide . while there is no single-template for doing so , senior executives in leading-organizations apply consistent-criteria in selecting their cios . the most obvious-criterion is relevant it expertise . rather than being technical-experts specifically , their cios intuitively understand it principles and trends and act as strategists , applying-technology and approaches skillfully to help resolve or overcome daunting-business-challenges . but even while it expertise is important , their cios are business-managers as well , with experience in administrative , financial , and corporate-management . such experience better enables the cios to work with business-managers to build a shared-vision for meeting-mission needs . for instance , one state-government-cio attributed his success to his breadth of experience across a variety of financial , retail , and it units , which facilitates his ability to page 24 gao-01-376g cio executive-guide get buy-in from stakeholders in the state . additional proficiencies-critical to cio-success include leadership-ability , innovation and flexibility , effective-communications-skills , interpersonal-skills , and political-astuteness . the weight that senior executives assign to each of these criteria in selecting a cio depends on the information-management-leadership model and the needs of the enterprise . cios are no longer tied to a single functional unit√i.e. , the ƒit shop.≈ instead , they are positioned as senior executives with the ability to strategically-view and apply it to the best advantage of the enterprise . cios generally report to and partner with their agency-heads , forging-relationships that ensure high visibility and support for far-reaching-information-management initiatives . as active-members of the ceos« executive teams , these cios are well situated to provide advice and direction , integrate it with the business-vision , and take part in high-level decision-making . active-participation in executive-processes and committees facilitates the cios« ability to build effective executive-level working-relationships . case-study : positioning the cio for success in 1996 , this manufacturing-company instituted a cio-position to help build its information-management-capability after deciding to split its former internal it service provider off as an independent business . for years , the manufacturing-company had relied on a wholly owned subsidiary to provide it products and services . with minimal it talent left in the company following the split-off , the cio had to create a new it leadership-staff . the company used a consultant to search for a cio to build the in-house information-management-capability . essentially , the company wanted a cio with it expertise , strong-management-skills , and background-experience in managing large , centralized-companies . the current cio exceeded their requirements . he came highly recommended due to his prior-success in transforming two other companies and his skill in outsourcing , which would be needed to manage the manufacturer«s continued-reliance on information technology-contract-services . the cio accepted the position only after obtaining senior executives« commitment to his vision for transforming not just information technology and management , but processes in the entire-company . senior executives set the cio up to succeed . they positioned him as a member of the senior decision-making-board , reporting to the vice-chairman of the company . they gave him the flexibility to bring in managers from the outside and set up a matrix-management-organization consisting of multiple-business sector cios aligned with functional-cios across the company , all reporting to the corporate-cio . they required that any it initiative include collaboration between a sector cio and a process-responsible cio , as illustrated in figure 4 . senior executives also made the cio the final-authority on all it budget , operations , and process-management issues . during the period from 1996 through 1999 , the cio has been effective in lowering projected annual it costs , for 1999 the total-reduction was over $ 450 million , when taking into account both cost-avoidance and cost-reduction , while enhancing the provision of it services to the company . figure 4 : matrix-management-organization in a leading-organization global-processes and systems strategies to consider in the absence of a single-model for instituting a cio , senior executives take precautions to ensure that their information-management-leadership positions are appropriately defined and implemented to meet their unique-business-needs . the following is an outline of the strategies that senior executives in these organizations use to determine the types of cios they need , select individuals to carry out these roles , and position them as effective and influential-members of the senior-executive decision-making-team . determine the cio model by • examining the current environment and identifying what the enterprise expects to accomplish through information-management before establishing a cio-position to lead improvements ; and • making the cio type ( i.e. , business-strategist , marketing-specialist , policy and oversight-manager , operations-specialist , etc . ) consistent with the enterprise«s mission , history , current environment , culture , and change readiness . define clear-roles and accountability for the cio by • delineating cio roles and responsibilities vis-à-vis those of other senior-managers ; • ensuring that the cio has the authority needed to be effective ; and • documenting cio roles , responsibilities , and accountabilities to help manage expectations and performance . select a cio with the right-skills set by • choosing-someone with information technology and management-expertise and the potential to help in business-transformation , consistent with the cio model selected ; and • ensuring that the individual also has the leadership and communications-skills and other proficiencies needed to effectively carry out the cio-position . make the cio a business-partner by • having the cio partner with other senior-executive managers , • empowering the cio to work with other senior executives to discuss and decide among alternative it products and strategies for meeting-business-needs , and • ensuring that the cio is involved in strategy-discussions at the highest levels so that he or she can lead the enterprise in using-information-management to corporate-advantage rather than merely responding to client-requests . critical-success-factors principles organizational-foci critical-success-factor 2 : promote organizational-credibility the second critical-success-factor focuses on the cio«s ability to establish the cio organization as a central-player in the enterprise . the legitimacy of the cio and the cio organization must be developed for the ceo«s message of information technology and management«s central-role to be accepted and for the cio organization to become a full-participant in formulating corporate strategy . both principles in this critical-success-factor pertain to the demonstration of the cio organization as an entity that can complete critical-projects successfully and contribute to the well being of the enterprise . this effort is largely the responsibility of the cio , and the focus is lateral and downward . the cio must create an environment in which the ability of the cio organization to contribute to the success of the enterprise is recognized . success , to be appreciated , has to be demonstrable and measurable . if the cio is not able to demonstrate that he or she deserves the support of the ceo and makes a valuable-contribution to the corporate-mission , the cio will not be effective as a full-participant in the corporate-decision-making-process . principle iii : ensure the credibility of the cio organization ƒwhile placement of the cio-position at a high level within the organization may carry some weight , the cio generally must earn credibility by making-things happen.≈ instituting a cio-position consistent with organizational-needs and finding a capable-leader to fill the job are no guarantee of cio-success . rather , the burden of ensuring-information-technology and management-effectiveness-shifts from senior executives to the cio and his or her supporting-organization . given the relative newness of the position vis-a-vis the rest of the business , the cio is faced with having to gain the attention and respect of managers at all levels across the organization and build the support and cooperation needed to effectively execute the information-management-leadership role . the following is a discussion of the strategies that cios in leading-organizations use to legitimize their roles and successfully collaborate with their business counterparts to guide it solutions to meet mission-needs . key-characteristics cios in leading-organizations recognize that providing effective-information management-leadership and vision is a principal-means of building-credibility for their cio-positions . cios do this in a number of ways . foremost , they do not manage it in a vacuum , but rather make sure that the information-management-program is well integrated with what senior executives want to accomplish . cios work with their executive-peers to jointly produce a vision educating senior-managers on the strategic-value of it , providing-advice and direction , and setting-expectations of what can be achieved . cios express this vision in business rather than technical-terms , and in such a manner as to generate enthusiasm , buy-in , and motivation for managers to strive together toward the achievement of common-goals . further , cios participate on executive committees and boards that provide forums for promoting and building-consensus for it strategies and solutions . we found this to be true for each of the case-study-organizations that we visited . having achieved senior-management-interest and backing , cios can leverage this support as needed to help ensure cooperation for carrying out information technology and management and business change-initiatives across the enterprise . effective-cios , and their supporting-organizations , do not set out to force their ideas and solutions on their business counterparts . instead , they seek to bridge the gap between technology and the business by networking informally , forming-alliances , and building-friendships that help ensure support for information technology and management . cio organizations then work with rather than for the businesses , getting them involved in projects and driving-ownership and accountability to line-management , rather than to the it shop . for example , in one case-study , the state-legislature placed the cio organization in charge of managing the planning , funding , and implementation of a project to develop a single-telecommunications-network to serve the state«s entire-education-community . rather than a technical-challenge , the project has been a huge-coordination-effort , requiring that the cio organization overcome rivalries and achieve the commitment and cooperation of traditionally autonomous-education-sectors . cios retain the support of their business-colleagues by following through on commitments to effectively-lead business-transformation projects , provide needed it products and services , and train and educate the user-community . through it all , cios strive to maintain open-communications and build trust . they do so by being accessible to the businesses , listening to user-feedback , and focusing on user-needs . cios recognize that balancing short-term-successes with longer-term business change-initiatives is key to keeping their business customers satisfied . in the initial-months of tenure , cios set out to understand their enterprises« needs and tackle tough issues ( i.e. , runaway-projects and crisis-situations such as year 2000 management ) that demand immediate-attention or could pose immediate-obstacles to success . in the short term , they also focus on building-relationships , addressing-business-imperatives ( i.e. , process streamlining and consolidation ) , and demonstrating-success by promptly providing highimpact-products and services ( i.e. , commercial off-the-shelf-software and desktop-equipment ) that allow them to achieve positive and visible-accomplishments fairly quickly . cios recognize that showing interim-results concurrent with more protracted-efforts such as multiyear-systems developments , ƒbig-ticket≈ infrastructure projects , or business-process reengineering can have significant positive impact on cio credibility . often , cios outline-plans of attack or roadmaps to help guide them in effectively implementing their short- and long-term strategies . documenting their courses of action helps them manage schedules and expectations and provides baselines against which to assess progress and performance . these cios are careful not to get caught in the cycle of continual-planning , but take steps to ensure effective-progression from planning to implementation . they return to their plans iteratively , updating them as progress is made and business-needs evolve . finally , cios in leading-organizations recognize that there is too much going on in the area of information technology and management for them to absorb all of the issues alone . rather than allowing their technology-ideas and programs to stagnate , they keep abreast of changes in the fast-paced-environment that might be applied to enhance capability and improve mission-performance in their own organizations . they do so through avid-reading , working with vendors , and following-market-directions . cios also benchmark , partner with , or seek advice from successful-peers and competitors on initiatives that provide opportunities for exchanging-ideas , sharing-capability and expertise , and achieving mutual-benefits in the larger information technology and management-community . for example , one state-cio with whom we met said that he values the gao-01-376g cio executive-guide page 31 guidance received from a cio advisory-board of private-industry representatives , convened by the governor to facilitate learning from business-organizations . this cio also partners with a major it corporation on a project to acquire standard desktop-equipment for all agencies under the governor«s purview . participation in key councils , advisory-groups , and government , trade , and professional-associations such as the industry advisory council and the national association of state information-resource-executives is also useful for exchanging-ideas , sharing-information , and identifying new ways to meet common-challenges . case-study : ensuring the credibility of the cio organization this state«s justice-network ( jnet ) illustrates how implementation of many of the practices discussed in this section has enhanced the credibility of the cio and his supporting-organization . jnet is a highly-successful project started by the cio organization enabling-agencies to jointly develop a single , secure , web-based-system to support administration of criminal-justice across the state . the project responds to the governor«s priority for consolidated-agency-projects , thereby ensuring high-level-support for cio efforts . the cio organization conceived the idea for jnet after receiving multiple-requests from criminal-justice agencies for funding to develop redundant-systems . the organization identified the joint-project as a good-opportunity to save on costs , share information , and reduce redundancy and errors by making it possible to enter new offender-information only once as subjects proceed through the criminal-justice-process . historically , the state«s justice-agencies have been highly autonomous and distrustful of outsiders . prior-attempts to get the agencies to work together failed . it managers recognize that success with the current-initiative goes a long way in increasing cio credibility with the state-agencies . the cio organization launched jnet by bringing together stakeholders from across the state in a series of meetings over the course of 2 months to establish a vision for a shared-system that would also meet individual justice agency-information needs . under executive-order , a senior-level-leadership-committee , including the cio , is responsible for establishing jnet policy , direction , and standards and for authorizing the release of jnet funds . a steering-committee consisting of justice-agency-representatives works with information-management-professionals and consultants to refine project-details . its biweekly-meetings provide a good-opportunity for the cio organization to build relationships with the state-agencies and for agency-representatives to get acquainted and learn about one another«s operations and data-resources . with central responsibility for controlling-contracts and funding drawn from the agencies« budgets , the cio organization is credited with being the ƒglue≈ that holds jnet together . a jnet office , established to administer the project on a day-to-day-basis , also reports directly to the cio . under cio guidance , jnet has been planned as a multiphase , multiyear-development-effort with interim-products and results . the cio organization has helped agencies successfully complete a pilot-phase to prototype initial jnet content and applications , also demonstrating the cio organization«s ability to help deliver on commitments . three additional-phases involve testing the system«s basic-data-sharing-function and adding new capabilities such as data importing , on-line-processing , and document-management . initially , the justice-agencies thought jnet was a bad-idea ; agency-representatives were pessimistic and merely went through the motions of working together . they posed such resistance that at one point , the cio had the lieutenant-governor make a surprise-visit to a steering-committee-meeting to oversee project-progress , demonstrate senior-management-support , and ensure agency cooperation toward meeting common-objectives . once the agencies saw the operational-prototype and the project«s potential , they realized that their individual-sacrifices had paid off . today , jnet continues to grow in scope and popularity . along with it , cio credibility has increased . the cio organization is currently working with several-counties to help link them with jnet . next-steps include instituting jnet at the local-level and ultimately partnering with other states to construct a nationwide justice-network . jnet«s success has served to legitimize and increase the value of the cio function to its business counterparts . now , other agencies , including the departments of health and public-welfare , also want to work with the cio organization on similar cross-functional-information-management initiatives . strategies to consider while senior executives are responsible for creating the environments and positions likely to ensure cio-success , it is the responsibility of the cios themselves to make that success a reality . regardless of all the promising-skills , strategies , and technologies they may bring to bear , no cio can be effective without first building-credibility with business-executives , it professionals , and user-communities alike to ensure commitment and support for their information-management-leadership and initiatives . the following-practices , commonly used by cios in leading-organizations to build credibility , can also be considered and applied by cios in federal-departments and agencies to better legitimize their positions and help ensure success in their individual business/cultural environments . provide information-management-leadership and vision by • ensuring that the vision encompasses senior management priorities , • educating top-managers on the value of information technology and management in helping to accomplish mission-objectives , • articulating the vision in business-terms to facilitate line-management-understanding and achievement of buy-in , and • using senior-management-discussion and decision-making forums as opportunities to build consensus for it programs and initiatives . establish effective working-relationships by • networking informally and forming-alliances with other senior-managers to help defuse potential-opposition and build commitment to new technology-directions ; • getting-managers from the business-side of the enterprise involved and accountable for information-management projects ; • fulfilling-commitments to provide effective it goods and services ; and • establishing open-communications and feedback-mechanisms , such as surveys and questionnaires , as a way to build trust . balance quick-successes with long term-impact by • setting-priorities and distinguishing between short term , high-impact-initiatives and longer term-objectives that require more vested-interest ; and • outlining a plan or strategy for accomplishing these priorities in an efficient and effective-manner . leverage external-information-technology and management-expertise by • keeping-abreast of technological-change and incorporating new products and strategies in the enterprise«s it program as appropriate , • forming-partnerships and building off of the success and expertise of external cio peers , and • networking and participating in forums in the larger community to debate and identify ways to address common-information technology and management-issues and concerns . principle iv : measure success and demonstrate-results ƒmeasurement determines what one pays attention to . the things that are measured become relevant ; the things that are omitted are out of sight and mind.≈ in many organizations the value of information technology and management is considered intangible¬difficult to measure and mired in terms of ƒsoft dollars≈ or ƒstrategic assets.≈ for this reason , in the past , few organizations embarked on programs to measure the effectiveness of it systems . however , it has become increasingly evident that without a measurement-process where results can be demonstrated , not only is information-management at a disadvantage when competing for scarce-resources , but also when making its case in support of efficiency and effectiveness-initiatives . for the cio organization to be viewed as part of the business , a structured process needs to be in place to measure success and demonstrate-results to the organization . this section discusses the approaches that leading-organizations use to measure-performance and results . key-characteristics while there is no standardized-approach to performance-measurement , leading-organizations strive to understand and measure what drives and affects their businesses and how to best evaluate results . these organizations have generally struggled with identifying and adopting-measures to assess the value of it , but have been able to put some measures in place to help demonstrate performance . they use measures for a variety of purposes . the measures are a vehicle for communicating with senior management and stakeholders in the areas the organization deems important . measures also serve as vital-management and decision-making-tools , providing-information that can be used to make improvements in business-outcomes and service-delivery . many managers told us that the measures that capture the most attention from senior management are simple ones¬or at least simple in terms of how they are expressed . in a number of instances , the organizations we visited used uncomplicated-terms to communicate measures , but the underlying-concepts were quite-involved and required a good-understanding of it and business-fundamentals . these organizations collapsed a lot of information into a form that effectively communicated the success or failure of information technology and management-activities and , in the case of the latter , expanded on the issues and supplied additional information . for example , one international-organization , involved in several product lines , measures its performance in line with the following organizational-business-priorities : • maximize performance ( i.e. , improve service and reduce it and management-costs ) • improve business-processes ( i.e. , it projects and e-commerce ) • increase-team-contributions • create a leading-edge electronic-communications process even though these measures seem simple , a considerable-amount of time , effort , and data are involved in amassing and assessing the results tied to these business-priorities . to establish joint-ownership for performance-management , organizations strive to construct measures jointly with their stakeholders , customers , managers , and cio staff . they work together to achieve a common-understanding of goals , metrics , and anticipated-outcomes that are easy to understand but are aimed at adding-value . managers told us that performance-measurement-systems work best when combined with established-measures that reflect customer/stakeholder needs and the activities of employees that are directly involved in information-management . the cio organization«s responsibility does not end with the establishment of measures , nor does the cio organization have sole-responsibility for technological-success . as a practical-matter , those responsible for judging the success of programs and their supporting-functions should agree on the measures used and become involved in monitoring the outcomes . although approaches vary , leading-organizations develop measures with a focus toward improving not only internal it performance but also external-relationships with technology-users and the overall-business . organizations balance various technical-measures to ensure that it products and services are deployed in the most effective and efficient-ways and lead to desired business-results . they focus on monitoring short- and long-term it measures that directly affect business-activities and produce real-business value . this means that it activities must be directly related to company-relationships with customers , clients , and suppliers , and also affect business-results , such as direct-costs or market share . leading-organizations use-performance measures that focus on business-outcomes such as customer-satisfaction-levels , service-levels , and in some instances total-requests satisfied . for example , one state-agency-commissioner requires that his departments develop tactical-plans for all areas , not just it . all executives participate in the planning-process . the performance-measures are broken down to meaningful-levels as a way of holding the ƒit shop≈ and other departments accountable for the services they provide . it goals and objectives are incorporated into the plans and it performance-outcomes are provided to the commissioner and his executive-staff on a quarterly-basis . this exercise has served to build credibility and help demonstrate the value that it adds to the organization . the existence of performance-measures has also made a difference in how agencies behave because the documentation they provide serves to make them accountable . to properly collect and analyze information , leading-organizations develop measurement-systems that provide insight into their it service-delivery and business-processes . the establishment of an information-feedback-system allows organizations to link activities and functions to business-initiatives and management goals . this feedback , in turn , leads to increased it productivity and organizational-effectiveness . one state we visited established an information-services-board to develop statewide-policy-standards and to monitor projects as part of its portfolio-management process . the board , however , has page 36 gao-01-376g cio executive-guide increasingly become more involved in monitoring and making-recommendations on troubled it projects . some of the lessons learned from the board«s project-reviews are that : • the board needs to get involved early in monitoring and overseeing-projects before considerable-funds are spent on the projects ; • long-term , high-cost-projects are no longer-sustainable because sponsors tend to be unable to sustain long-term support ; • projects are best managed in a limited-commitment , phased approach ; and • projects should quickly demonstrate-results . once planning and decision-making-structures are in place and performance-results can be used as part of the decision-making-process , organizations are in a better position to ensure that goals and objectives clearly-link and align with it performance-measures . leading-organizations also assess the readiness of their organizations to use it measures and their receptiveness to data-collection , measurement , and analysis . further , they nurture a philosophy that is positive toward performance-management and measurement , and they view measures as a way to focus on business-value and customer satisfaction . in summary , managers at the organizations we studied cautioned that it performance-measurement is in its infancy and measurement-techniques are still evolving , partly-due to changes in technology . most of the organizations are continually looking for ways to improve their it measurement-systems as a means of supporting achievement of organizational-goals . case-study : measuring-success and demonstrating-results to measure its information technology ( it ) and management-initiatives , one state instituted a performance-measurement-process ( illustrated in figure 5 ) that is driven by an it strategic-plan . the plan sets forth the goals and strategies needed to support the state«s entities in developing it plans , in using-information resources , and in defining it performance-measures . the it strategic-plan also aligns very closely with the state«s strategic-plan , that sets forth four broad-goals for the use of it within the state : ( 1 ) improve service-delivery ; ( 2 ) make information more accessible ; ( 3 ) use it to improve productivity ; and ( 4 ) invest in people , tools , and methods . the it strategic-plan also incorporates stakeholder-involvement by including-perspectives by state-agency executives , legislators , educators , and other stakeholders on the use of the state«s it resources . also included in the plan is information from the state«s biennial it performance-report . this report evaluates the state«s progress toward meeting the last biennium«s it strategic-plan-goals and includes a summary of strategic and operational-performance-measures . these measures , in part , are the result of the state«s previous it strategic-plan and are meant to measure how well it resources are being used to achieve the state«s overall strategic-goals and operational ( technical ) objectives . these results are published in the state«s biennial it performance-report and are used to benchmark the state«s information-management-services . the state-legislature also uses this information to allocate future-funding . figure 5 : performance-measurement framework measured and monitored strategic performance-measures operational-performance-measures • progress made in deploying the state« s educational • number of workload-transactions completed and telecommunications-network telephone-lines installed • increase in state«s use of internet-resources • number of driver«s licenses issued for specific-periods • increase in the number of courts having access to state«s justice information-network . information from the biennial it performance-report is used to develop the it strategic-plan strategies to consider performance-measurement is a critical-step in ensuring-results and success from any project , but especially from information technology and management-initiatives whose value is often-difficult to capture . while performance-measurement is still evolving in principle and in practice , leading-organizations have pinpointed a number of strategies that have proven useful in gauging the impact and benefits of their it investments . these strategies are discussed below . engage internal and external-stakeholders in defining and managing it performance by • ensuring that mission-delivery and it performance-measures are integral to strategic-management and decision-making processes ; and • establishing internal and external-customer-groups to periodically review , validate , and accept it performance-measures . ensure that processes are in place to balance business and technical-measures by • developing specific technical-performance-measures for it products and services and balancing them with business-driven measures , and • demonstrating that the performance-measurement-data generated are reliable and useful . establish an effective-data-collection and performance-feedback process by • developing well-designed performance-data collection methods ; • establishing a limited-set of outcome-based-performance measures that link to mission-outputs and outcomes ; and • utilizing-concise , understandable-performance-reporting tools and techniques and conducting-performance-measurement reviews , as needed . critical-success-factors principles organizational-foci critical-success-factor 3 : execute cio responsibilities the cio and supporting-organization are ultimately-responsible for successfully executing their role in the enterprise«s mission . how central this role is to the strategic-plans of the enterprise will depend on each of the first two critical-success-factors , but support from the top and all efforts to build credibility will be futile unless the cio organization is run effectively . if the cio organization is not able to execute its responsibilities , and if it is not able to play the critical-role for which it has been developed , the corporation will learn to work around it , or it will be replaced . there are many aspects to successfully organizing and running a cio organization . however , this critical-success-factor , as well as the underlying-principles , focuses on the elements that leading-organizations believe are most central to the cio«s responsibility . determination of the cio organization-structure must fall to the cio , as he or she is the senior-executive of that unit . aligning the cio organization with the needs of the enterprise is critical to the satisfaction of those needs . communicating-enterprise requirements to staff and making appropriate-decisions to meet the needs of the enterprise are the responsibility of the cio . as the cio organization«s representative in strategic-decision-making forums , the cio must be the translator of those strategies into cio organization-initiatives . along with technology , human-capital is the central-resource the cio has to execute his or her responsibilities . while the cio is accountable for and reviews-technology-decisions , staff from business-areas may develop most of the investment-proposals . human-capital plans for the information-management and technology-area are seen as the particular-responsibility of the cio . in the current it environment , technology has become a commodity . the human-capital involved in applying that technology to achieve the mission of the enterprise is a resource that requires the cio«s attention . the hiring , retention , and training of information-management and technology-personnel is seen by leading-organizations as a fundamental-principle of good cio practice . principle v : organize information-resources to meet business-needs ƒwhile the cio is important , it is the operating-environment for the entire-organization that will make it successful.≈ developing a cio organization is an ongoing-process that demands a clear-understanding of the organization«s responsibility for helping meet business-needs . this responsibility , along with parent business-processes , market-trends , internal-legacy-structures , and available it skills , drives decisions as to the structure of the cio organization and how the organization is aligned with the rest of the enterprise . ultimately , the ceo controls the assignment of information technology and management-functions to the cio , the cio organization , and other organizational-units . once these decisions are made , the cio organization must provide effective , responsive support through efficient-allocation of resources and the day-to-day-execution of its responsibilities . this principle examines the practices that leading-organizations commonly use in establishing cio organizations to effectively meet their mission-needs . key-characteristics it is the duty of a cio to manage expectations and help ensure that all members of a cio organization have a clear-understanding of their responsibilities . in leading-organizations , evolving business-processes play a key role in determining how these information-management-responsibilities are structured and adapted to meet changing-needs . we found that leading-organizations quickly reallocate and make information-resources available on a routine , sometimes daily or hourly-basis to address changes in business-processes . external-factors , such as market-trends , changing technology , and available-skills as well as internal-legacy-structures and corporate-ventures , also influence how a cio organization is formed , aligned , and adjusted to help support the rest of an enterprise . for example , one organization that we studied had experienced two mergers that required the company to quickly integrate the new businesses and restructure to meet growing-business-needs . human-resources-systems were consolidated and new corporate-structures were quickly defined to ensure continued-support to the enlarged-customer-base . the company remains prepared to restructure to meet ever-changing-business requirements . in lieu of establishing either completely-centralized or decentralized cio organizations , leading-organizations manage their information-resources through a combination of such structures . in this hybrid , the ceo assigns central-control to a corporate-cio and supporting cio organization , while delegating specific-authority to each business unit for managing its own unique-information management-requirements . the corporate-cio and supporting cio organization centrally formulate-policies and standards for all it-related-activities . they also centrally manage architectures and a core-set of infrastructure-components to provide common it services to the entire-corporation . the corporate-cio works with cios or other information-managers in each of the business units to ensure efficient , reliable , and interoperable-technology for the entire-corporation . the following-figure illustrates traditional centralized and decentralized organizational-structures , in comparison with the hybrid-combination used by leading-organizations today . figure 6 : comparison of decentralized , centralized , and hybrid structures leading-organizations decide , as part of a sourcing-strategy , whether to provide specific-information-technology and management services with in-house-staff or external-providers . an organization«s sourcing-strategy is part of a larger human-capital-development strategy , which is discussed in principle vi . the shortage of skilled it workers in the current-market-environment is often a major-reason for leading-organizations to outsource . the cio and decision-making-authorities decide what type of work is appropriate to outsource and what type of work is best performed internally . typically , leading-organizations cultivate long-term skills such as contract-management , project-management , and security-management , while outsourcing short-term-skills such as application-development . for example , one state-capital that we visited is home to over 600-software-companies . it skills are in great-demand which made hiring by the state difficult , so this cio looked for alternatives to in-house software-development and management . it made sense for the state to outsource tactical functions such as help-desks and mainframe-management . on the other hand , there are responsibilities such as it planning and oversight that must remain in-house . as the state contracts out more of its information technology and management-functions , it is also essential that it have good-contract management-expertise . along with effective-allocation of available-resources , leading-organizations execute their information-management-responsibilities reliably and efficiently . technology is highly integrated with the business-processes in these organizations because technology is viewed as an enabler for the business , not just a tool . the organizations make it investment-decisions based on business-case analyses and return-on-investment-projections . consistent with a fundamental strategic-information-management approach , the organizations also focus on continuous-process-improvement . the organizations provide reliable-information management-capabilities on a daily basis , but also look to the future by pursuing new initiatives that show how technology can improve the business of tomorrow . for example , one state-cio that we interviewed said that his role was to identify enterprisewide and strategic-initiatives to improve state-information-management . one initiative involved establishing strategic-direction , guidelines , and standards for instituting electronic-commerce in the state government . electronic-commerce was to be used for such activities as renewing-licenses and paying-taxes . leading-organizations simplify projects by producing incremental-deliverables that quickly show success and demonstrate the impact of effective cio management while still focusing on long-term-objectives . as discussed in principle iii , carrying out successful projects is expected in leading-organizations , and adds to the credibility of the cio and the cio organization . case-study : organizing-information resources to meet business-needs implementing a combination of centralized and decentralized information-management enables leading-organizations to effectively-support their business-operations . one leading-organization implements a combination of centralized and decentralized it and structures to best meet the needs of its three diverse-lines of business√an international-services-division , an international-industry-division , and a retail-division . the organization uses a centralized it infrastructure with decentralized-development efforts to provide efficiency and security for its corporate customers . efficiency is the number one priority of the organization in terms of dollars spent as well as technology performance . the organization has cios in each of its three business units . each business unit makes it investment-decisions based on business-requirements and the technology available to support those requirements . for example , desktop-platforms and software vary among business units depending on the unique-needs of each business area . the work in the business units is all performed in-house and is not outsourced , as business-expertise is considered a core-competency . the business-cios work together to determine how it can be used to reach customers across business-lines . the international services and international-industry-divisions have some common-requirements based on the international-nature of the two divisions . the international-industry-division and the retail-division have common-requirements based on the specific-industry . the cios of these divisions work together , leveraging-opportunities for shared it products and services so that each unit can invest fewer dollars to accommodate common-needs . the corporate it organization«s role is to aggregate-needs across business units and provide solutions that can be integrated to serve the entire-corporation . common-components of each business area include data centers , human-resources , payroll , a financial architecture , and a common-desktop-environment . standard-processes and tools , such as contingency-planning , interdependency identification , protocols , and risk management , are used to coordinate multiple-business-areas . these standard-utilities evolved through two corporate-mergers and are now institutionalized across the corporation . the mergers required that the organization quickly adopt new organizational-structures and address new business-requirements . the standard-processes and policies developed , applied , and improved as a result of the mergers provide this organization with the flexibility it needs to adapt to future-changes in responsibility . this organization is constantly looking to improve its it investment-processes . all technology-investments are justified using business-case analyses . the decision-making-process for establishing-business-cases recently evolved to include competitive-needs . competitive-needs were not considered when this organization initially postponed electronic-commerce-initiatives due to low return-on-investment-projections . the organization fell behind the competition in providing this service and the delay may have cost it customers . as a result , competitive-needs are now considered part of the decision-making-process . strategies to consider an effective cio organization is a dynamic-structure , responding not only to business , mission , and cultural-requirements , but also to rapidly changing-technologies , elusive-skills , and competing resources in the external-market-environment . leading-organizations recognize the myriad-forces driving their it capabilities . the following is an outline of the strategies that these organizations consider in deciding how to effectively-structure , source , and execute their technology-management-operations . create a clear-understanding of responsibilities within the organization by • articulating a common-description of responsibilities to all levels of the cio organization , and • assigning-responsibilities to parts of the organization based on skills and organizational-structure . use a combination of centralized and decentralized organizational-structures by • centrally formulating-policy and standards for all it-related-activities , and providing common it services through a centrally managed-infrastructure ; and • delegating-authority to the business units to manage individual-information management-requirements . create an adaptable organizational-structure by • redeploying internal-resources to quickly address changing-business and customer-requirements . select appropriate sourcing-strategies by • considering outsourcing-noncore-responsibilities to address the shortage of skilled it workers in the current-market-environment , and • keeping core-competencies in-house . execute cio responsibilities efficiently by • providing reliable and efficient it services and products , • making it investment-decisions based on business-case analyses and return-on-investment , projections , and • producing incremental-deliverables to demonstrate-results while still focusing on longterm-objectives . principle vi : develop information-management human-capital ƒproviding good-benefits-packages and building-core-competencies are other ways of attracting , stimulating , and retaining it workers¬ especially among today 's δself-preservation-minded generation-xers.«≈ as is true with the other principles , the business-requirements of an enterprise-drive-decisions related to the specific-types of resources needed to implement technology successfully . external market-forces and internal-legacies influence the types of skills available to a cio organization . given these realities , the cio organization must provide an effective , responsive it workforce to help accomplish missions and goals . this principle discusses the strategies that leading-organizations use to assess their skill-bases and attract , recruit , and retain it professionals . key-characteristics leading-organizations develop human-capital-strategies to assess their skill-bases and recruit and retain staff who can effectively implement technology to meet business-needs . figure 7 provides an overview of the strategy that leading-organizations use to secure information-management human-capital . figure 7 : strategy for securing human-capital in leading-organizations training it u outsource leading-organizations assess their it skills on an ongoing-basis to determine what expertise is needed to meet current responsibilities and support future-initiatives . they can evaluate the skills of their employees using-methods provided by entities such as carnegie mellon university«s software-engineering institute6 and the information curtis b. hefley , w.e . & miller , s. ( 1995 ) . people capability maturity model . [ technical report cmu/sei-95-mm-02 ] . pittsburgh , pa : software-engineering institute , carnegie mellon university . gao-01-376g cio executive-guide page 47 technology association of america . needed skills are compared with existing-capabilities in the organization to determine gaps in the it skills-base . for example , the state-university at one of our case-study-locations had conducted a study revealing continuing gaps in the state«s ability to recruit and retain it workers vis-à-vis industry . in response to the governor«s initiative to expand the state«s it workforce , proposals were made for a program to recruit and fund-college and university-students willing to study-technology-management as a prelude to becoming-part of the state government«s labor-force . strengthening the skills and capabilities of it professionals through training and innovative hiring-practices is part of a formula for building-information technology and management-capabilities . leading-organizations sometimes use surveys that compare missing capabilities with market-availability to determine what skills to acquire through hired professionals . when professionals with the necessary-skills can not be hired , these organizations supplement the existing-workforce with external-information-resources . more specifically , they cultivate expertise in their internal workforces , while outsourcing-skills that are available from multiple-sources at lower cost . leading-organizations may even choose to replace labor with technology when they can not hire the skilled-professionals they need . core-information-management functions include project-management , security-management , and contract-management-practices that can apply to a variety of projects . the various-staffing and sourcing-strategies provide leading-organizations with dynamic-workforces that can quickly carry out these functions to meet changing-business-needs . studies forecast an ever-increasing-shortage of it professionals , presenting a great-challenge for both industry and the federal government . organizations are finding it difficult to retain staff when their competitors can always offer higher salaries . for example , one state-government-cio organization that we studied experienced a 22-percent-turnover in it professionals . despite having higher technology-wages than any other state in the country , the state remains at a disadvantage in competing with industry and must rely on alternative-strategies and incentives to attract and retain skilled-workers . while benefits , recognition , and challenging-responsibilities are also useful in securing-staff , leading-organizations identify training as a major nonsalary-incentive for attracting and retaining skilled it professionals . leading-organizations-dedicate an increasing-percentage of their it budgets to training . sometimes such funds are devoted to retraining existing-nontechnical personnel to supply them with it expertise . for example , one industry case-study organization sponsors a 3-month course to retrain about 2,000 legacy employees in project-management-skills . the company also offers a range of formal-classroom-training , less formal-workshops , and informal-mentoring-programs . given the change-management environment for it in this company , staff always wants and needs to be in a learning-mode . similarly , another industry cio told us that he provides it training through a program that pays new employees 50 percent of their salaries while they attend school . upon completion of training , the employees each earn 75 percent of their salary during an initial-performance-evaluation period , and full-salary at the end of that period . while managers in leading-organizations are accountable for creating-opportunities for their employees« training , individual staff are responsible for taking advantage of those opportunities . in general , leading-organizations provide training as part of a changing high-tech-work-environment that includes state-of-the-art tools and methods allowing skilled it workers to perform their jobs to the best of their ability . we identified additional-strategies that leading-organizations use to enhance their information-management-workforces . specifically , these organizations bring in employees with desirable-skills from across the enterprise to work in conjunction with it professionals , thereby maximizing the capability of their technical resources . these employees make up cross-functional-teams that provide an appropriate-mix of business-expertise and it skills to accomplish the various-tasks of a project . working together , the members reflect the interests of not just information technology and management , but the user-community and the project«s stakeholders , and provide a holistic-blend of technical , project-management , value-management , budget , finance , and procurement skills and capabilities to meet mission-needs . case-study : developing-information management human-capital using a variety of staffing and sourcing-strategies provides leading-organizations with dynamic-workforces that can quickly meet changing-business-needs . one leading company«s cio said that recruiting information-management workers with special-skills in areas such as data-networks and systems-administration is extremely competitive . to be successful in recruiting , his organization has devised different-offer-packages to attract employees . a package might include accelerated-salary-schedules or stock options . once hired , the company sends these employees back to college for it training and invests in them . this cio acknowledges , however , that his company does not spend enough on training . currently , approximately 1 percent of the it operating-budget is devoted to training . this organization also provides training to new employees through a program that pays 50 percent of the employee«s salary while he or she attends school . upon completion of training , the employee enters a performance-evaluation-period during which the employee earns 75 percent of his or her salary . after successfully completing the performance-evaluation-period , the employee then begins earning a full-salary . the organization increased its salary-base to compete with other companies in retaining and attracting talented-information management-workers . besides salaries , company-managers view a good working-environment and awards and recognition as essential for retaining-employees . recently , the cio took over 400 employees and guests to a five-star-hotel for an evening out to celebrate the group«s accomplishments . when senior-managers appreciate business accomplishments , they are willing to spend funds for staff recognition . this cio admits that his it workers are constantly asked to work long hours and undergo a lot of stress though they get little in return for the amount of work they do . this cio believes that money is not the only motivator for it staff . he feels that an important-element to managing-staff is finding-ways to recognize individuals and say ƒthank you.≈ when the thank you comes from inside the organization , it goes a long way . the cio uses different-means to show his appreciation . for instance , his staff publishes a monthly-appreciation-newsletter through the intranet . the cio believes there is big-payoff in these types of activities and the costs are minimal , if any . the cio also views-time off as a good-incentive-bonus because it does not cost the company very much . other incentives his group has undertaken include taking-staff out for lunch or handing out $ 100 american express-checks . in today«s environment , organizations have to be creative . one of the managers created a thank you toolkit to show her appreciation to her staff . the cio states , ƒif you don«t have a lot of money to spend , you have to ask yourself , what are the little-things you can do to show your appreciation.≈ strategies to consider given the increasing-shortage of it professionals in the current-market-environment , securing an effective , responsive-technology management-workforce is a challenging-task for both business and government-organizations alike . leading-organizations have identified the following-strategies that help in assessing their it skills and recruiting , retaining , and utilizing-talent to meet their business-needs . these organizations consider and apply the various-strategies as appropriate within the organizational , financial , and cultural-parameters of their individual-business and government-enterprises . assess the skill-base by • determining-expertise needed to perform information-management-responsibilities , and • identifying-gaps between skills available and skills needed . identify innovative-ways to attract talent by • providing good-benefits-packages , and • building-core-competencies . provide training , tools , and methods to help retain expertise , including • directing an increasing-percentage of the budget to fund training , • evaluating-staff to make sure they are achieving the desired technical-skills , • holding-managers accountable for providing-training opportunities for their staffs , and • providing a high-tech-environment of tools and methodologies for skilled it professionals . employ alternative-methods and sources for supplying-talent , including • outsourcing and supplementing the existing-workforce with external-expertise , • bringing in employees with desirable-skills from across the enterprise to work with and help maximize the capability of information technology and management-professionals , and • replacing-labor with technology . using this guide the principles and practices we developed based on our interviews with leading-organizations in the private sector and state government have enabled us to construct a framework to guide federal cio organizations . in our discussions with about half of the cios of major federal-departments and agencies and five cios of small federal-agencies , we found that they generally agree with the leading-organizations on the fundamental-management-principles for information-management and technology . at the same time , we found that the practices used by federal-cios tend to differ from those used by leading-organizations . we did not study the reasons for these deviations specifically , although some likely-result from the context in which federal-cios operate . both operational and structural-aspects of the cio«s environment can vary significantly between the public sector and the private sector . rather than dwell on differences , it is more useful to focus on the considerable common-ground between public and private cio organizations to build efforts for improvement . the specific-key-conditions and strategies described in this guide can be used as suggestions for federal-cios to apply or adapt to their environments , as appropriate . more generally , the key-conditions and strategies can be thought of as addressing specific-aspects of the six primary-principles , which cios from all sectors agree are critical to the successful-execution of their responsibilities and realization of the potential-benefits of information technology-investments . taken as areas of focus , these aspects may be evaluated by federal cio organizations and tackled using-techniques suited to their situations . recognition of the differences described above , as well as others , should influence the application of advice provided in this guide . but the advice of cios of leading-organizations should remain relevant regardless of the specifics of the situation . the ideas presented in this guide may also provide the foundation for further discussion within the federal cio community . many federal-cios , in the normal-course of their own efforts , have already begun working along the lines of the advice provided in this guide . these cios have gained valuable-insights into applying the practices of leading-organizations to the federal-sector . the cio council , or other organizations of federal-cios , can create an opportunity for sharing these experiences , using the principles described in this guide as an organizing-framework . the challenge of understanding how the federal-context influences the effectiveness of the principle may be best met with support from managers who work in the same context . in addition , the specific-key-conditions and strategies described in this guide will provide insight when considering-areas of future-study . for example , specific-principles may be investigated more deeply and strategies for implementing a principle , such as developing-information-technology human-capital , may be proposed in more detail . or those aspects of the federal cio environment that constrain the federal cio flexibility and hinder the ability to perform effectively may be examined more closely , and specific-strategies to cope with those aspects may be proposed . understanding how cios of leading-organizations approach their work , and acknowledging those aspects of the federal cio environment that limit the ability to implement similar-strategies , may prompt congressional and executive-board-discussions about the need for future-legislation and policy-changes . a few dimensions in which the federal and private sector can differ are described below . these examples largely stem from the nature of the public sector in which federal-cios operate . many of these examples were mentioned by federal-cios interviewed for this guide . however , the extent to which the differences create additional-constraints on the cios depends on how they and agency-leaders respond to them . • senior-executive-management in the federal-sector can differ significantly from the private sector . the agency-head is a political-appointee who often is more focused on policy-issues than on internal-management and operations . this can deny the cio the ƒceo≈ support that is so critical for the successful-integration of information technology into business or mission functions . • the budget decision-making-process used for information technology-projects can present particular-challenges for the federal cio not found in the private sector . for example , legislative-actions , such as tax-law-changes and medicare payment-process changes , may require extensive-system-modifications , and the cio does not have the flexibility to decide whether or not to pursue them . this ties up resources that might otherwise have been expended differently . in fact , mandated projects often must be funded by money that had been planned for other projects . long-term investment-strategies are difficult because agencies are asked to put together-funding-requests 1824 months in advance of funding availability . in addition , it funds may be contained within the appropriations for a specific-program or an overall administrative budget , making them less visible and , if part of discretionary-spending , more subject to volatile-changes in the federal-budget . as a result , the cio may not have control or direct-oversight over much of the it funding within the agency . • personnel-decisions in the federal-sector are often constrained due to work-rules or organizational-factors . current-information management job-descriptions do not match the occupations recognized in the industry-today . training-funds are often limited due to larger budget-considerations . recently , the office of personnel-management ( opm ) found salaries in the federal-government-to be lower than in the private sector . on november 3 , 2000 opm implemented a governmentwide-policy increasing-salaries in several it categories in an effort to make federal-employment more competitive . because this policy was recently implemented , we can not yet assess the impact of these changes on federal-employment practices . • the federal cio may direct an organizational-structure in which duties that would typically be a cio«s responsibility in the private sector are not under his or her direction at all . for example , some federal-cios are in charge of large-policy and oversight-functions with little operational-responsibility . while this may be an appropriate-model , it is critical that any model be matched with the overall-needs of the agency in mind . • the range of responsibilities , as defined by legislation , that accrue to the cio are very broad in the federal-sector , including-areas such as records-management and freedom of information act requirements , for which there is little-parallel in the private sector . while federal-cios often may not have operational-authority for the full-range of responsibilities in the legislation , they and their agencies are still subject to oversight by the congress in many of these areas . though the environment faced by a cio in the federal-sector clearly differs from that of cios in other contexts , the principles that form the basis for this guide remain relevant . the underlying-principles were observed consistently in our sample of leading-organizations , and were cited as being critical to the success of their cios . federal-cios can learn from the successes of these leading-organizations and can apply the principles as appropriate in their own organizations . in addition , agency-heads and other senior-leaders in the federal government can gain an understanding of their roles in executing the critical-success-factors that must be addressed as cios work to meet the letter and intent of the clinger-cohen act and related-legislation . appendix i federal-legislation affecting-information management federal financial-management-improvement act of 1996 ( public-law 104-208 ) ¬ this act requires that agency financial-management-systems comply with federal financial-management-system requirements , applicable federal-accounting-standards , and the u.s. government standard general-ledger ( sgl ) in order to provide uniform , reliable , and more useful financial information . the act requires that auditors for each of the 24 departments and agencies named in the cfo act report , as part of their annual-audits of the agencies« financial statements , whether the agencies« financial-management-systems comply substantially with federal financial-management-systems requirements , applicable federal-accounting-standards , and sgl at the transaction-level . the act also requires that gao report on its implementation annually . clinger-cohen act of 1996 ( public-law 104-106 ) ¬ this law is intended to improve the productivity , efficiency , and effectiveness of federal-programs through the improved acquisition , use , and disposal of it resources . among other provisions , it ( 1 ) encourages federal-agencies to evaluate and adopt best management and acquisition-practices used by both private and public-sector-organizations , ( 2 ) requires agencies to base decisions about it investments on quantitative and qualitative-factors associated with the costs , benefits , and risks of those investments and to use-performance data to demonstrate how well the it expenditures-support improvements to agency-programs , through measurements such as reduced-costs , improved-employee-productivity , and higher customer satisfaction , and ( 3 ) requires executive-agencies to appoint cios to carry out the it management-provisions of the act and the broader information-resources management-requirements of the paperwork reduction act . the clinger-cohen act also streamlines the it acquisition-process by eliminating the general services administration«s central-acquisition-authority , placing-procurement responsibility directly with federal-agencies , and encouraging the adoption of smaller , modular it acquisition-projects . paperwork reduction act ( pra ) of 1995 ( public-law 104-13 ) ¬ pra applies life-cycle management-principles to information-management and focuses on reducing the government«s information-collection-burden . to this end , pra designated senior-information-resources manager-positions in the major-departments and agencies with responsibility for a wide-range of functions . pra also created the office of information and regulatory affairs within the omb to provide central-oversight of information-management-activities across the federal government . government-management reform act of 1994 ( public-law 103-356 ) ¬ this legislation expands the requirement for a fully audited financial-statement under the cfo act to 24 agencies and components of federal-entities designated by the office of management and budget . the act requires the department of the treasury to produce a consolidated financial-statement for the federal government , which gao is to audit annually . federal acquisition streamlining act of 1994 ( fasa ) ( public-law 103-355 ) ¬ this law requires agencies to define cost , schedule , and performance-goals for federal-acquisition-programs ( to include it projects ) and monitor these programs to ensure that they remain within prescribed tolerances . if a program falls out of tolerance , fasa requires the agency-head to review , take necessary-actions , and , if necessary , terminate the program . government-performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993 , public-law 103-62 ¬ gpra requires agencies to prepare multiyear strategic-plans that describe mission-goals and methods for reaching them . the act requires agencies to develop annual-performance-plans that omb uses to prepare a federal-performance-plan that is submitted to the congress along with the president«s annual-budget-submission . the agency-plans must establish measurable-goals for program-activities and describe the methods by which performance toward those goals will be measured . the act also requires agencies to prepare annual-program-performance reports to review progress toward annual-performance-goals chief financial-officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 ( public-law 101-576 ) ¬ the cfo act provides a framework for improving federal government financial-systems . it centralizes within omb , through the deputy director for management and the office of federal financial-management , the establishment and oversight of federal financial-management policies and practices and requires omb to prepare and submit to congress a governmentwide , 5-year financial-management plan . the act also requires the 24 major-agencies to have cfos and deputy-cfos and lays out their authorities and functions . further , the act sets up a series of pilot-audits under which certain-agencies are required to prepare agencywide financial statements and subject them to audit by the agencies« inspectors-general . computer-security act of 1987 ( public-law 100-235 , as amended by public-law 104106 ) ¬ this law addresses the importance of ensuring and improving the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal-computer-systems . the act requires that the national institute of standards and technology develop standards and guidelines for computer-systems to control loss and unauthorized modification or disclosure of sensitive information and to prevent computer-related-fraud and misuse . the act also requires that all operators of federal-computer-systems , including both federal-agencies and their contractors , establish security-plans . federal managers« financial-integrity act ( fmfia ) of 1982 ( public-law 97-255 ) ¬fmfia requires agencies to establish internal-accounting and administrative-controls in compliance with standards established by the comptroller general . the act also requires that omb establish , in consultation with the comptroller general , guidelines that the agencies shall follow in evaluating their systems of internal-accounting and administrative-controls . government information-security reform ( p.l . no . 106-398 , div . a , title x , subtitle g ) -this legislation amends 44 u.s.c . chapter 35 by enacting a new subchapter on `` information-security . '' the security act requires the establishment of agencywide-information security-programs , annual agency-program reviews , annual independent-evaluations of agency-programs and practices , agency reporting to omb , and omb reporting to congress . the act covers programs for both unclassified and national-security-systems , but exempts-agencies operating national-security-systems from omb oversight . the security act is to be implemented consistent with the computer-security act . government-paperwork elimination act ( gpea ) ( p.l . no . 105-277 , div . c , title xvii ) -gpea requires that by 2003 federal-agencies provide , where practicable , for the option of submitting , maintaining , or disclosing-information in electronic-form as a substitute for paper , and for the use and acceptance of electronic-signatures . privacy act of 1974 ( public-law 93-579 ) ¬ the privacy act protects the privacy of individuals identified in information-systems maintained by federal-agencies by regulating the collection , maintenance , use , and dissemination of information by such agencies . freedom of information act of 1966 ( public-law 89-554 ) ¬ this law established the right of public-access to government information by requiring-agencies to make information accessible to the public , either through automatic-disclosure or upon specific-request , subject to specified-exemptions . appendix ii objectives , scope , and methodology the objective of our research was to determine how several leading-organizations have implemented their cio-positions and supporting-management-infrastructures . we were interested in identifying effective cio management-practices used across a variety of organization-types and structures . in doing so , we also sought to develop specific case-study-information on how cios have helped improve the effectiveness of their organizations« business-operations . we have used this information to develop suggested guidance to assist federal-agencies in effectively integrating newly created cio functions into their respective-organizations . we synthesized a great deal of literature and research on cio organizations to provide ideas on effective-practices in information technology and management . this body of knowledge served as a foundation for designing our project-approach . we then conducted-case-studies at a number of private and public-organizations . we have found that case-studies provide an abundant source of information describing-management-practices and the intellectual-background that led to the development of those practices . case-studies also provide the flexibility to pursue particularly rich-avenues of inquiry as they develop during interviews . finally , they are also an excellent-means of communicating the essence of practices that have worked well by capturing the context as well as the specific-practice . we identified-candidate-organizations for our study based on awards and recognition from professional-organizations and publications over the past several years . we conducted-multi-day visits to organizations that agreed to participate in our study to learn • each organization«s approach to selecting , positioning , and defining the roles and responsibilities of its cio ; • techniques for instituting it policies and standards , managing technical-personnel and financial-resources , building customer/supplier relationships , and measuring the performance of it organizations in meeting-business-needs ; and • strategies for promoting and facilitating-business and organizational-change through it . we visited three private and three public-sector-organizations recognized as leaders in successfully managing-information and technology-investments to create value and improve business performance . we selected private-organizations across a range of dimensions , including-type of business , number of employees , and revenues . all private-organizations contacted had received recognition by professional-organizations and publications , corporate-executives , or independent-researchers . our selection of state-organizations was based on recognition by professional-publications , state-cios , and the national association of state information-resource-executives ( nasire ) . in particular , nasire awards-recognition to states whose systems have made important-contributions to the operations of state-governments . the following organizations participated in our study : • commonwealth of pennsylvania • state of texas • state of washington • chase manhattan bank • general motors corporation • j.c. penney we also interviewed the former cio of the state of california and the current cio at u.s. west communications , although we did not conduct comprehensive-case-studies at these entities . we conducted-site-visits to each participating-organization and obtained supporting-documentation , illustrations , and examples . during the visits , we interviewed the cio , members of the senior-executive-team , it managers , and other officials as identified by the host-organization , to obtain their individual-perspectives on information and technology-management-issues . based on the documentation and interviews obtained from our site-visits , we compared practices across organizations to identify innovative-practices used by individual-organizations as well as common practices used across the variety of organizations participating in our study . we subsequently interviewed 50 percent of the federal cio council members as a means of comparing federal cio practices with our case-study-results and ensuring that practices used in the industry and state-organizations also addressed the challenges found in the federal government . we selected a mix of federal-organizations to visit , taking into consideration their various mission-types ( civilian , military , or regulatory ) , centralized and decentralized-structures , and prior gao study-results . further , we met with a panel of cios from five small federal-agencies to determine whether the practices identified are also applicable across diverse organizational-sizes ( based on dimensions such as budget , personnel , etc. ) . these discussions , which are summarized in the section entitled ƒcurrent federal cio environment , ≈ helped us identify similarities and differences in the cio management-practices of federal versus leading-organizations . the discussions have also enabled us to pinpoint areas where federal-agencies can benefit from integrating the practices of such leading-organizations in their respective-organizations . our research was conducted from march through october 1999 and culminated in the issuance of an exposure-draft in march 2000 . since march 2000 we received-comments from a variety of organizations and individuals . based on suggestions from the general-public we have considered and made changes to the text where appropriate . general consensus of those providing-input was that the cio guide represented leading-practices and that the document was insightful and valuable . appendix iii related
