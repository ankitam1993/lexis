the fort worth star-telegram grant to beef up legal-aid-reserves by max b. baker november 18 , 2002 a state-foundation is giving west texas legal-services and the fort worth chapter of the naacp more than $ 1 million to help provide civil legal-services to the poor . the texas equal-access to justice foundation announced that the fort worth-based nonprofit-groups will receive grants from funds it controls , including the interest on lawyers ' trust-accounts , or iolta , program . west texas legal-services , which works with clients in 106 counties including tarrant , lubbock , midland and potter , will get about $ 1.03 million . the legal-aid-group cleared about 8,300 cases last year . `` it is going to help us out tremendously with our program , '' said kathy duncan at west texas legal-services . `` if it was n't for the grant , we could n't continue to do the work we are doing . '' west texas handles such cases as divorces , protective-orders in domestic-violence-cases and land-lord-tenant-disputes . it has a staff of about 100 employees , including-attorneys and support-staff , in 10-branch-offices . the naacp 's fort worth justice project will get $ 49,000 . officials from the group 's legal-assistance-program were not available to comment . created by the texas supreme court , the equal-access foundation has distributed about $ 8 million statewide . besides the iolta program , the money comes from court-filing-fees and a state criminal victims assistance-program . in texas , 4.2 million people qualify for legal-assistance because they make at or below 120 percent of the federal-poverty guideline . in tarrant county , 204,000 people are eligible for legal-aid . the grants come at a time when funding for programs providing attorneys for the poor are in jeopardy from declining-interest rates , cutbacks in federal-funding and legal-challenges . `` it needs to be a whole lot more , '' said betty torres , executive director of the austin-based foundation . `` although the poverty-population in texas has increased , statewide and federal-funding for this vital-work is in decline . '' about $ 4.9 million being distributed this year comes from the iolta fund , which is interest earned on money paid to lawyers as retainers or to cover court-costs . the funds are held in trust-accounts . because of lower interest rates , foundation-officials anticipate having only $ 3.3 million in that fund next year . to make the money go further , the group persuaded 25 banks to waive service-fees of about $ 555,000 . as part of a national-overhaul of the legal-services corp. , the nine legal-aid-groups in texas are being folded into three , creating huge-agencies handling-cases in dozens of counties . on dec. 31 , west texas legal-services will merge with legal-services of north texas , which is in dallas and covers eight counties . renamed northwest texas legal-aid , its headquarters will be in arlington . created by congress in 1974 , legal-services corp. is frequently a budgetary-target . it has been requiring-states to consolidate legal-aid-groups in an attempt to conserve money and improve services . the future of the iolta program is also in doubt . on dec. 9 , the u.s. supreme court will hear arguments about the constitutionality of the iolta program in the state of washington . opponents say the interest earned on the trust-funds belongs to the clients and can not be diverted to charitable-groups without compensating their clients or getting their permission . the 9th u.s . circuit-court of appeals in san francisco ruled that the washington fund is constitutional , while the 5th u.s . circuit-court of appeals in new orleans last year ruled that texas' fund was an improper-taking of assets .
