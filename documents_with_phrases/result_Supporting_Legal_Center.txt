deseret news friday , april 12 , 2002 kudos for supporting legal center by john a. adams the utah state-legislature in the just-completed-session has stepped forward in a year of very difficult financial-challenges and , in honor of their colleague the late sen. pete suazo , appropriated $ 100,000 toward the purchase of a building to create the nation 's first community legal center . sen. suazo , who represented salt lake 's urban and diverse district 2 , was admired by his senate colleagues for his tireless efforts for equal-access to justice for all of utah 's citizens . the community legal center will be located in sen. suazo 's district and is a project of the state 's leading-providers of free civil legal-services to lower-income individuals and families -- the disability law center , the legal-aid society of salt lake and utah legal-services . their efforts , like those of sen. suazo , promote economic and family-stability , fight injustice and help people help themselves . these three agencies , which have a total of 35 lawyers and 84 staff-employees , last year provided legal-advice or represented-clients in disputes in over 21,000 legal-matters . the agencies resolve serious legal-problems for those with no place else to turn -- the poor , ethnic-minorities , seniors and people with disabilities . the building will also house two smaller volunteer-based-programs , the multi-cultural law center and the senior-lawyer volunteer project . each of these not-for-profit legal-service-providers has a specific-mission or client base : utah legal-services focuses legal-assistance to the state 's low-income-residents ; legal-aid society assists clients with domestic-relations and domestic-violence-issues in salt lake county ; disability law center focuses on assistance to people with physical and mental-disabilities ; the senior-lawyer volunteer project assists elderly-individuals with estate-planning and end-of-life-issues ; and the multi-cultural law center provides a variety of legal-aid to utah 's growing ethnic-communities . to their credit , these groups have been a model of cooperation and innovation to improve efficiencies in the delivery of legal-services in our state . several years ago they formed the `` and justice for all '' campaign , which raises money from members of the private utah state-bar . utah 's lawyers and law-firms are among the most generous in the nation ; more than $ 1.5 million has been raised since the campaign began . co-location helps the agencies meet three important-goals . first , `` one-stop-shopping '' will make access to legal-aid and our nation 's system of justice easier for utahns . second , it will allow the agencies to share some staff and services to achieve efficiencies of operation . last , it will provide greater opportunity for volunteer-service by private-attorneys and law-students . it should be noted that two of these agencies also have offices in ogden , provo and cedar city so that legal-needs elsewhere in the state may be served . the former morrison and merrill building located at 205 n. 400 west is the site of the new community legal center . the 30,000-square-foot building was recently refurbished by its prior owner , the olafson group , which generously donated $ 400,000 toward the $ 4 million project . the appropriation of $ 100,000 sends a clear-message that utah's legislators and gov . mike leavitt are willing to lead out and not just give lip-service to helping-utahns obtain access to our legal-system . it is hoped that the example of our political leaders , coupled with the generous-contributions already made by organizations and individuals , including the george s. and dolores dore eccles foundation , the utah bar-foundation , the herbert i. and else b. michael foundation , the cities of salt lake and murray , and the agencies , employees and boards of trustees , will prompt other foundations , businesses and private-citizens to contribute the remaining-funds necessary to pay for the purchase of the building . apart from the capital-campaign that is now under way , utah lawyers are making a major-difference in helping increase access to justice . last year more than a third of the members of the utah state-bar contributed to the `` and justice for all '' campaign , and more than $ 440,000 was raised to help these agencies operate and perform their vital-mission . people pulling together for a common worthwhile-cause makes all the difference , but leadership starts at the top . thanks to our legislature for leading out in difficult financial-times . john a. adams is president-elect of the utah state-bar .
