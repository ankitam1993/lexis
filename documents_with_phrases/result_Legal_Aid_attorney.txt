legal-aid-attorney heeds call to serve december 30 , 2002 depictions of lawyers in american-pop-culture are notoriously-unkind . whether castigating them on the silver-screen , between the lines of pulpy , true-crime-narratives , or in the jokes told around the proverbial-water-cooler , attorneys have been on the receiving-end of many a hackneyed-punch-line . one roseburg-attorney is doing her best to refute the cultural stereotype , however . legal-aid-attorney sharon lee schwartz knew when she entered-law-school at georgetown university that she wanted to use her training to help others . `` a reason i went to law-school was to do social-justice-work , '' schwartz said recently . `` i get paid to make the community a better place for vulnerable-people -- and i like that . '' schwartz grew up in charlotte , n.c. she earned a bachelor 's degree in english literature from davidson college before heading to georgetown for her law-degree , where she finished in 1993 . `` when i was in school i really liked virginia woolf , '' schwartz said of her nascent literary-tastes . `` right now what i read is nonfiction . `` i 've been reading a lot about buddhism , '' she added . `` i just sort of call it my peace-studies-program -- any author that i think has ideas ( as to ) how people can live together without killing each other , that 's what i like to read . '' schwartz replaced former legal-aid-attorney lori rubenstein at the roseburg-office in 1996 , although she initially interviewed for the position in 1994 . during that two-year-interim , she worked for legal-aid on a reservation in south dakota practicing-family , tribal and housing-law . legal-aid is a nonprofit national-organization aimed at providing-low-cost or free legal-aid to those who need it . a south dakota blizzard six years ago prompted her to call the roseburg-office , which , coincidentally , was in the process of trying to find her to fill the vacancy left by rubenstein's departure . schwartz said her job keeps her involved in the community -- and allows her to sleep with a sound-conscience . `` just because there 's so much more demand for our services than we can actually meet , once we actually take a case we always feel like we 're on the right-side , '' she said . for the time being , however , both her sleep and her job may have to suffer some periodic-disturbance . schwartz and her husband , scott cohan , welcomed their first child into their lives last week , sophia clare cohan . `` it 's wonderful , '' said the new mother . `` i mean , it 's really , really-fun . '' schwartz plans to take maternity leave until the end of january . rounding out the attorney 's other full-time-roles as mother to her child and legal-ally to the poor is that of amateur-artist . `` i guess i 've sold a few things , '' schwartz said , but `` mostly i just make things for myself . `` i just finished a stained-glass window that i 've been working on for four years ... i paint the walls of my house all different-colors and patterns and things like that . '' schwartz has also tried her hand at sculpting-clay -- and her welding-torch at sculpting-steel . `` i just want to make things that are interesting to look at , '' she said . `` i ca n't say that my art 's intended to give any particular-message . '' asked how she and her husband manage to juggle so many competing-demands upon their time , schwartz replied , `` we do n't watch tv . '' schwartz tries to limit herself to a normal eight-hour work day , she said , in spite of a heavy-demand for indigent legal-services in the community . `` i figured out early on that i could work around the clock and still meet only a fraction of the need , '' schwartz said .
