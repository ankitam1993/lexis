section-by-section summary of the clear skies act of 2002 the clear skies act of 2002 extends and reorganizes title iv of the clean-air act to establish new cap-and-trade-programs requiring reductions of sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-emissions from electric-generating-facilities . the clear skies act retains existing title iv requirements until the new requirements take effect . further , the clear skies act amends certain-provisions of title i of the clean-air act that currently apply to the combustion-units covered by the new title iv emission-caps . title iv of the clean-air act as revised by the clear skies act , title iv has five parts . part a contains provisions common to the control of all three pollutants . part b contains provisions specifically for sulfur-dioxide-emission reductions . part c contains provisions specifically for nitrogen-oxides emission-reductions . part d contains provisions specifically for mercury-emission-reductions . part e contains performance-standards for affected-units and provisions for research , environmental-monitoring , and assessment . part a . general-provisions section 401 . reserved . section 402 . definitions section 402 is based on the existing-section 402 , modified to include new terms used in parts a through d and to move to subpart 1 of part b the defined terms that are unique to the acid-rain-program . section 403 . allowance-system section 403 is the existing-section 403 , modified to apply to sulfur-dioxide-allowances , nitrogen-oxides-allowances , and mercury-allowances under the new trading-programs essentially the same allowance-system-provisions that apply to sulfur-dioxide-allowances under the existing-acid-rain program . certain-provisions unique to the acid-rain-program are moved to subpart 1 of part b . further , for the acid-rain-program and the new trading-programs , the existing-section 403 is revised to provide that only the signature of the party-transferring-allowances ( not the signatures of both parties to the transfer ) is necessary for the transfer to be effective . the administrator has already issued regulations under the existing-section 403 for sulfur-dioxide-allowances and must issue-regulations within 24 months of enactment governing the issuance , transfer , recording , and tracking of the nitrogen-oxides-allowances and mercury-allowances . the allocations of these three types of allowances , and the determination of the data used in making the allocations , will not be subject to judicial-review . like sulfur-dioxide-allowances , nitrogen-oxides-allowances and mercury-allowances are limited authorizations to emit and are not property rights . owners or operators of units or facilities must hold sulfur-dioxide-allowances , nitrogen-oxides-allowances , or mercury-allowances at least equal to the emissions of sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , or mercury respectively . under the acid-rain-program and the nox sip-call , the owner or operator of each affected-unit must hold allowances at least equal to annual-emissions from the unit . section 403 revises the existing-section 403 to provide for facility-level , rather than unit-level compliance : beginning in 2008 for the sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides and beginning in 2010 for mercury , the owner or operator of each facility with affected-units must hold allowances at least equal to the total annual-emissions of those units . in order to meet the allowance holding-requirements for nitrogen-oxides starting 2008 or for sulfur-dioxide or mercury starting 2010 , the owner or operator of a facility may use-allowances purchased in a direct-sale from the administrator at a fixed-price , i.e. , $ 4,000 for a sulfur-dioxide or nitrogen-oxides-allowance ( covering one ton ) and $ 2,187.50 for a mercury-allowance ( covering one ounce ) . these prices will be annually adjusted for inflation . for the direct-sales , the administrator will use-allowances from future-auctions . if this results in the removal of all allowances from the relevant-auction for three consecutive-years , the administrator must conduct and submit to the congress a study to determine whether revisions to the relevant-trading-program are necessary . section 404 . permits and compliance-plans section 404 is the existing-section 408 , modified to apply to the new sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-trading programs essentially the same permit-provisions that apply to the existing-acid-rain program . certain permitting-provisions unique to the acid-rain-program are moved to subpart 1 of part b or , if expired , are deleted . the requirements of all the trading-programs must be reflected in permits issued to the affected-facilities under this section and title v of the clean-air act . the permits must prohibit ( i ) emissions in excess of the allowances held and ( ii ) use of allowances before the period for which the allowances were issued . each permit-application must include a statement that the owner or operator will meet the applicable-allowance-holding requirements , and such statement serves as the compliance-plan under title v for these trading-programs . the existing-section 408 is revised to provide that a permit-application covering a unit in a particular-trading-program must be submitted to the permitting-authority in accordance with the deadline established under title v , rather than the deadline ( e.g. , twenty-four-months before a new unit-commences operation ) under existing-section 408 . section 405 . monitoring , reporting , and recordkeeping-requirements section 405 is the existing-section 412 , modified to apply to the new sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-trading programs essentially the same monitoring , reporting and recordkeeping-requirements that apply to the existing-acid-rain program . continuous emissions monitoring systems ( cems ) must be installed and operated to monitor emissions from each affected-unit . all units under the new trading-programs must monitor the parameters required under the acid-rain-program ( i.e. , sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , opacity , and volumetric-flow ) , and those units-subject to the mercury-trading-program must monitor mercury as well . the administrator must specify requirements for any alternative-monitoring-system shown to provide information with the same precision , reliability , accessibility , and timeliness as that provided by cems . further , the administrator may specify an alternative-monitoring-system for determining-mercury-emissions to the extent that the administrator determines that cems for mercury with appropriate-vendor-guarantees are not commercially-available . existing-section 412 is revised to provide that , consistent with the requirement of facility-level-compliance in section 403 , the administrator will not require a separate cems for each unit where two or more units utilize a single-stack , unless data for individual-units are required under another provision of the clean-air act . section 405 also sets deadlines for owners or operators of units to install and operate continuous emissions monitoring systems to monitor specified emissions or parameters under the new trading-programs . the deadlines are one year before the unit becomes subject to the relevant-trading-program . the existing-deadline for a unit under the acid-rain-program is retained . this section also retains the requirements in the existing-section 412 concerning the use of substitute-data when emission-data from a cems or an approved alternative-monitoring-system are not available during any period and the owner or operator can not provide information , satisfactory to the administrator , on emissions during that period . the administrator already issued regulations implementing the existing-section 412 and must issue new regulations by january 1 , 2008 for monitoring of mercury . section 406 . excess-emissions-penalty ; general-compliance with other provisions ; enforcement section 406 is the existing-section 411 , modified to address excess-emissions-penalties with regard to emissions of sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury . the excess-emissions-penalties reflect changes from the allowance holding-requirements from unit-level to facility-level-compliance in section 403 . for example , under the acid-rain-program during 1995-2007 , the owner or operator of a unit that fails to hold allowances covering its annual-sulfur-dioxide emissions is treated as having excess-emissions . starting in 2008 for sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides and in 2010 for mercury , the owner or operator of a facility that fails to hold allowances covering the annual-emissions of its affected-units is treated as having excess-emissions . the owner or operator of a facility with excess-emissions must both offset the excess-emissions with an equal-amount of allowances and pay a financial-penalty . in contrast with the existing-section 411 , which imposes a full financial-penalty starting immediately after the deadline for holding-allowances covering-emissions , section 406 imposes a financial-penalty that is graduated , with the penalty increasing the longer the period before the excess-emissions are offset and the financial-penalty is paid . if the offset and penalty-payment are made within 30 days after the deadline for holding-allowances , the penalty per ton or , for mercury , per ounce of excess-emissions equals the clearing-price of an allowance in the most recent-auction . if the offset and penalty-payment are made 31 or more days after the deadline , the penalty is three times the auction-clearing-price . for all the trading-programs and consistent with the existing-section 411 , the excess-emissions-penalty does not preclude imposition , in addition , of civil-penalties for violations . section 406 also includes the existing-section 413 . as under the existing-provision , compliance with title iv does not affect , except as expressly provided , the application of other requirements of the clean-air act . section 406 also provides that no state or political-subdivision thereof shall restrict or interfere with the transfer , sale , or purchase of allowances under this title . section 406 also includes the existing-section 414 and applies to the new sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-trading programs essentially the same enforcement-provisions that apply to the acid-rain-program . like each excess-ton of sulfur-dioxide , each ton of excess-nitrogen-oxides or each excess-ounce of mercury is a separate-violation . section 407 . election for additional-units section 407 provides the option for units that are not otherwise subject to the new sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-trading programs to opt into the programs if certain-conditions are met . the units must vent all their sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-emissions only through a stack or duct and must meet the monitoring and reporting-requirements for those trading-programs , except that each unit must be separately monitored . each unit , to establish its baseline , must monitor and report its emissions in accordance with the monitoring and reporting-requirements under section 405 for one year before entering the programs . the administrator will allocate to an opt-in-unit an amount of allowances equal to fifty percent of : the lesser of the unit's baseline-heat-input or the unit 's heat-input for the year before the year for which the administrator is determining the allocation ; multiplied by the lesser of the unit 's baseline-emission-rate , the unit 's 2002-emissions-rate , or the unit 's most stringent-state or federal-emission-limitation applicable to the year on which the unit 's baseline-heat-input is based . moreover , the allocation is subject to an increasing-reduction each year ( a 1-percent-increase each year for twenty years and a 2.5 percent-reduction each year thereafter ) , with a corresponding-increase in the amounts of allowances auctioned for each year . this is analogous to how allowances and auctions are handled for affected-electricity generating-units ( egus ) under the trading-programs . once a unit opts into the trading-programs , the unit will remain an affected-unit . the only circumstance under which a unit will be withdrawn from the opt-in-provisions is where the unit qualifies as an affected-egu independently of the opt-in-provisions . in that circumstance , the unit remains subject to the trading-programs but is covered by the non-opt-in-requirements that cover all affected-egus . section 408 . clean-coal-technology regulatory-incentives section 408 is the existing-section 415 , which addresses the department of energy 's clean-coal-technology program . section 409 . auctions section 409 requires the administrator to issue-regulations within 36 months of enactment concerning-auctions of sulfur-dioxide-allowances , nitrogen-oxide-allowances , and mercury-allowances . the regulations must specify the procedures , frequency , and timing of auctions . allowances may be auctioned before or during the year for which the allowances are issued , and auctions may be conducted one or more times during a year . the auctions must be open to any person , and there will not be any minimum-price set for the auctions . the administrator may , by delegation or contract , provide for conduct of an auction by another government-agency or non-governmental-agency , group , or organization . the proceeds from all auctions will be deposited in the u.s. treasury . this section also establishes detailed default-procedures for auctions . the procedures will apply if the administrator is required to conduct an auction but has not yet issued regulations establishing-procedures . the default-procedures provide for the sale of all allowances at a single , clearing-price . this contrasts with the auction-provisions in the existing-section 416 providing for a declining-price-auction where winning-bidders-purchase allowances at their bid-prices . section 410 . evaluation of limitations on total-sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-emissions that start in 2018 . section 410 establishes criteria and the process by which the administrator-reviews and makes recommendations to congress as to whether the limitations on the total-amounts of allowances available-starting in 2018 for sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury ( whether through allocation or auction ) should be adjusted . the administrator , in consultation with the secretary of energy , must conduct a study that addresses a number of specific-factors regarding , among other things : the need for further reductions of these pollutants from affected-egus and other sources to attain or maintain the national-ambient-air quality-standards ; whether adjusting any of the limitations would have benefits that would justify the costs of such adjustment ; the relative marginal-cost-effectiveness of the reductions from affected-egus ; and the feasibility of attaining the limitations and any alternative-limitations . in addition , the study must address the most current scientific-information relating to emissions , transformation , and deposition of these pollutants . any documents considered in such a study must be independently peer-reviewed no later than july 1 , 2008 . the results of the study itself must be independently peer-reviewed no later than january 1 , 2009 . the administrator must make any recommendations to congress no later than july 1 , 2009 and may submit separate-recommendations addressing-sulfur-oxides , nitrogen-oxides , or mercury at any time after the study and the peer-review have been completed . part b. sulfur-dioxide-emission reductions subpart 1 of part b retains the requirements of the existing-acid-rain program , with a few relatively-minor changes , through december 31 , 2009 . subpart 2 establishes a new trading-program with a requirement to hold allowances covering-emissions-beginning january 1 , 2010 . subpart 3 establishes a back-stop-trading-program for states in the western regional air partnership . subpart 1 . acid-rain sulfur-dioxide program section 411 . definitions section 411 contains the definitions unique to the acid-rain-program . section 412 . allowance-allocation section 412 includes , with no substantive-changes , certain-provisions from existing-sections 403 and 408 that apply only to the acid-rain-program . the remaining-provisions from existing-sections 403 and 408 , which apply , as modified , to parts b , c , and d , have been retained in part a , sections 403 and 404 . section 413 . phase i sulfur-dioxide-requirements section 413 is existing-section 404 , containing without change the phase i sulfur-dioxide-allocations and modified to set a new deadline for new applications for allowances from the conservation and renewable energy reserve . the existing-deadline ( i.e. , december 31 , 1999 ) for completion of all actions for which allowances from the reserve may be earned has passed . the existing-deadline for entities to submit new applications based on those actions is moved up from january 1 , 2010 to one year after enactment . any remaining-allowances in the reserve at that time will be allocated to existing-units subject to the acid-rain-program . section 414 . phase ii sulfur-dioxide-requirements section 414 is existing-section 405 , which contains the phase ii sulfur-dioxide allocation formulas with no substantive-changes , except to take account of the fact that compliance starting in 2008 will be at the facility ( not the unit ) level . section 415 . allowances for states with emissions-rates at or below 0.80 lbs/mmbtu section 415 is existing-section 406 , which provides additional-formulations for phase ii allocations with no substantive-changes . section 416 . election for additional-sources section 416 is existing-section 410 , modified to reduce the allocations for opt-in-units in the acid-rain-program to 50 percent for applications submitted to epa after january 1 , 2002 . in addition , the provisions requiring-issuance of rules to allow process-sources to opt in and establishing the small-diesel refinery allowance-allocation program ( which ended in 1999 ) are removed . section 417 . auctions , reserve section 417 is existing-section 416 , modified to remove direct-sales of allowances ( which have already been terminated by rule ) and to terminate the private-sales of allowances through the annual-sulfur-dioxide allowance auction . section 417 also reduces the amount of allowances in the annual-auction to account for the fact that sulfur-dioxide-allowances for the year 2010 and beyond will no longer be auctioned under this subpart . section 418 . industrial so2 emissions section 418 is existing-section 406 of the clean-air act amendments of 1990 , which was not previously incorporated into the clean-air act and sets a cap on sulfur-dioxide-emissions from certain industrial-sources . there are no substantive-changes to the existing-section 406 . section 419 . termination section 419 provides that owners or operators , starting january 1 , 2010 , are no longer-subject to sections 412 through 417 of this part . beginning january 1 , 2010 , the requirements of subpart 2 of this part will apply . subpart 2 . sulfur-dioxide-allowance program section 421 . definitions section 421 contains the definitions unique to the new sulfur-dioxide-trading program . the definition of the term `` affected-egu '' establishes which electricity generating-units are covered by the new trading-program . the program covers units in the u.s. and its territories . the program includes existing-fossil fuel-fired-electricity generating-boilers and turbines and integrated-gasification combined cycle-plants with generators having a nameplate-capacity of greater than 25 mw . the program also includes new fossil fuel-fired-electricity generating-boilers and turbines and integrated-gasification combined cycle-plants regardless of size , except for gas-fired-units serving one or more generators with total nameplate-capacity of 25 mw or less . in addition , certain existing and new cogeneration-units are exempt , as well as solid waste incineration units and units for treatment , storage , or disposal of hazardous-waste . section 422 . applicability section 422 provides that the owner or operator must hold allowances for all the affected-egus at a facility at least equal to the total-sulfur-dioxide emissions for those units during the year . compliance with the requirement to hold allowances covering sulfur-dioxide-emissions will thus be determined on a facility-wide-basis . this is reflected in the monitoring and reporting-requirements , which provide that units sharing a common-stack do not need to be separately monitored and must collect sufficient-information to determine compliance . section 423 . limitations on total-emissions-section 423 establishes the annual-caps on sulfur-dioxide-emissions for affected-egus : 4,500,000 tons starting in 2010 and 3,000,000 tons starting in 2018 . during the first year of the new trading-program , 99 % of the allowances will be allocated to affected-egus with an auction for the remaining 1 % . each subsequent-year , an additional 1 % of the allowances for twenty years , and then an additional 2.5 % thereafter , will be auctioned until eventually all the allowances are auctioned . auction-proceeds will go into the u.s. treasury . section 424 . egu allocations section 424 requires the administrator to determine individual egu allocations , which will set on a one-time-basis and therefore will remain the same each year . ninety-five-percent of the total-amount of sulfur-dioxide-allowances allocated each year under section 423 will be allocated based on the amount of sulfur-dioxide-allowances allocated under the acid-rain-program for 2010 and thereafter and that are held in allowance-accounts in the allowance tracking-system on the date 180 days after enactment . in determining the amount of allowances in each unit-account and general-account as of that deadline , the administrator will discount-allowances allocated for 2011 or later at a rate of seven percent per year to reflect the time-value of allowances . the remaining-allowances are allocated to units that do not receive allowances under the acid-rain-program , whether because they are subject to the program and have a zero allocation or because they are simply not subject to the program . three and one-half-percent of the total-amount of sulfur-dioxide-allowances allocated each year will be allocated to such units that are affected-egus under the new trading-program as of december 31 , 2004 and commenced-operation before january 1 , 2001 . one and one-half-percent of the total-amount of sulfur-dioxide-allowances will be allocated to units that are affected-egus as of december 31 , 2004 and commence-operation during the period january 1 , 2001- december 31 , 2004 . allowances will be allocated based on the units ' baseline-heat-input multiplied by standard-emission-rates that vary depending on the fuel combusted by the units . standard-emission-rates are established for three categories of units : coal-fired-units ; oil-fired-units ; and other units . for each of the above three allowance-pools , each facility 's allocation will be adjusted to ensure that the total-amount of allowances allocated does not exceed the applicable-total of allowances available for allocation for the year . the allowance tracking-system for sulfur-dioxide-allowances was already established for the acid-rain-program , and essentially the same system will be used for the new sulfur-dioxide-trading program . however , the administrator must still promulgate-regulations determining the individual-unit-allocations for a given year . in the event that the administrator is unable , for any reason , to promulgate allocation-regulations on a timely-basis , section 424 provides a default-method for distributing the allowances , without promulgation of regulations , in advance of the year for which the allowances are necessary so that owners and operators can plan for compliance . under the default-method , eighty percent of the total-amount of sulfur-dioxide-allowances available for allocation each year will be allocated to acid-rain-program units with coal as their primary or secondary-fuel or residual-oil as their primary-fuel , listed in the administrator 's emissions scorecard 2000 , appendix b ( 2000 data for so2 , nox , co2 , heat-input , and other parameters ) , table b1 ( all 2000 data for all units ) . the allocations will be based on the heat-input of those units as set forth in the emissions scorecard 2000 , which summarizes the emissions-data received by epa for those units for 2000 . in addition , five percent of the total-amount of sulfur-dioxide-allowances available for allocation each year will be auctioned . the remaining fifteen percent of the allowances will not be made available , whether through allocation or auction . section 425 . disposition of so2 allowances allocated under subpart 1 under section 425 , after the administrator allocates allowances under the new trading-program , the administrator will remove from the allowance tracking-system accounts all sulfur-dioxide-allowances for the year 2010 and later that were allocated under subpart 1 of this part . the administrator will promulgate-regulations to allow use of any banked pre-2009 sulfur-dioxide-allowances in the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide program . section 426 . incentives for sulfur-dioxide-emission control-technology section 426 establishes a reserve of 250,000 allowances for affected-egus that combusted eastern bituminous and that , before 2008 , install and operate sulfur-dioxide control-technology and continue to combust such coal . a procedure is established for submission of applications by owners and operators and approval of applications and award of allowances by the administrator . the procedure is designed to ensure that the administrator will approve those qualified-projects that will result in the largest amount of sulfur-dioxide-emission reductions achieved per allowance awarded . subpart 3 . western regional air partnership ( wrap ) this subpart establishes a back-stop-trading-program that will go into effect if the states in the wrap ( i.e. , arizona , california , colorado , idaho , nevada , new mexico , oregon , utah , and wyoming ) are unable to meet the sulfur-dioxide-emission level ( 271,000 tons ) that they established for 2018 for electricity generating-units emitting over 100 tons of sulfur-dioxide per year . in general , if that emission-level is exceeded in 2018 or later , the trading-program , which reflects the back-stop-trading-program already developed by the wrap and is modeled after the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide trading-program , will require a separate set of allowances for affected-egus in the wrap state to be held covering-emissions starting the third-year after the level is exceeded . the wrap and nationwide-programs are separate : sulfur-dioxide-allowances in the wrap program may not be used in the nationwide-program ; and the sulfur-dioxide-allowances in the nationwide-program may not be used in the wrap program . section 431 . definitions section 431 contains the definitions unique to the new wrap trading-program . the definition of the term `` affected-egu '' establishes which electricity generating-units are covered by the new wrap trading-program . the program covers those units covered by the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide trading-program that are located in the states in the wrap and that , in any year starting in 2000 , emit more than 100 tons of sulfur-dioxide and are used to produce electricity for sale . the definition of `` covered-year '' establishes when the new wrap trading-program will begin . generally , the trading-program and the requirement to hold allowances will begin the third-year after the first year ( starting 2018 ) in which the total-emissions of affected-egus exceed 271,000 tons . however , the wrap states may unanimously petition the administrator to determine that the total-emissions of affected-egus are reasonably projected to exceed 271,000 tons in 2018 or a later-year and to make affected-egus subject to the requirements of the new wrap trading-program . based on such a petition , the administrator may by regulation make affected-egus subject to the requirement to hold allowances starting the third-year after the first year ( starting 2013 ) when the administrator makes such a determination . the term `` covered-year '' also includes each year after the year in which the requirement to hold allowances begins . section 432 . applicability section 432 provides that the owner or operator must hold allowances for all the affected-egus at a facility at least equal to the total-sulfur-dioxide emissions for those units during each covered-year . as in the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide trading-program , compliance with the requirement to hold allowances will thus be determined on a facility-wide-basis . section 433 . limitations on total-emissions-section 433 establishes the annual-cap on sulfur-dioxide-emissions for affected-egus of 271,000 tons in each covered-year . section 434 . egu allocations section 434 establishes the procedures for determining-allocations for individual-units that are affected-egus as of december 31 of the fourth-year before the covered-year . the allocations will be set on a one-time-basis and therefore will remain the same each year . allowances will be allocated based on the units ' baseline-heat-input multiplied by standard-emission-rates that vary depending on the fuel combusted by the units . standard-emission-rates are set forth for three categories of units : coal-fired-units ; oil-fired-units ; and other units . each facility 's allocation will be adjusted to ensure that the total-amount of allowances allocated does not exceed 271,000 tons per year . the allowance tracking-system for sulfur-dioxide-allowances was already established for the acid-rain-program , and essentially the same system will be used for the new wrap trading-program . however , the administrator must still promulgate-regulations determining the individual-unit-allocations for a given year . in the event that the administrator is unable , for any reason , to promulgate allocation-regulations on a timely-basis , section 434 provides a default methodology-analogous to that for the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide trading-program for distributing the allowances , without promulgation of regulations , in advance of the year for which the allowances are necessary . eighty percent of the total-amount of allowances available for allocation for the year will be allocated based on heat-input in 2000 to affected-egus that are acid-rain-program units with coal as their primary or secondary-fuel or residual-oil as their primary-fuel , listed in the administrator's emissions scorecard 2000 . five percent of the allowances available for allocation will be auctioned . the remaining fifteen percent of allowances will not be made available . part c. nitrogen-oxides-allowance program subpart 1 of part c retains the requirements , until 2008 , of the existing-acid-rain program for nitrogen-oxides-reduction . subpart 2 establishes , beginning january 1 , 2008 , a new nitrogen-oxides trading-program . two trading-zones are established , and , only allowances allocated or auctioned for a given zone may be used by facilities within that zone to meet the requirement to hold allowances covering-emissions . subpart 3 codifies the budgets and other requirements in epa 's rulemaking ( known as the nox sip-call ) concerning ozone-transport in the eastern u.s. , which requires that certain eastern-states revise their state-implementation-plans to reduce nox-emissions . subpart 1 . nitrogen-oxides emission-reduction program section 441 . nitrogen-oxides emission-rate reduction program section 441 is the existing-section 407 , which includes the emission-rate-limitations and other requirements for nitrogen-oxides under the acid-rain-program . the existing emission-rate-limitations for individual-boilers , which are based on boiler-type , are not changed . section 442 . termination section 442 terminates the existing-acid-rain program nitrogen-oxides provisions in section 441 on january 1 , 2008 when the new nitrogen-oxides trading-program begins . subpart 2 . nitrogen-oxides-allowance program section 451 . definitions section 451 contains the definitions unique to the new nitrogen-oxides trading-program . the definition of the term `` affected-egu '' establishes which electricity generating-units are covered by the new nitrogen-oxides trading-program , which are the same electricity generating-units as are covered in the u.s. and territories by the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide trading-program . section 452 . applicability section 452 provides that the owner or operator must hold allowances for all the egus-units at a facility at least equal to the total nitrogen-oxides emissions for those units during the year . as in the new nationwide-sulfur-dioxide trading-program , compliance with the requirement to hold allowances will thus be determined on a facility-wide-basis . section 453 . limitations on total-emissions-section 453 establishes the annual-caps on nitrogen-oxides emissions affected-egus : 1.562 million tons starting in 2008 and 1.162 million tons starting in 2018 for zone 1 ; and 538,000 tons starting in 2008 for zone 2 . during the first year of the new trading-program , 99 % of the allowances will be allocated to affected-units with an auction for the remaining 1 % . each subsequent-year , an additional 1 % of the allowances for twenty years , and then an additional 2.5 % thereafter , will be auctioned until eventually all the allowances are auctioned . auction-proceeds will go into the u.s. treasury . section 454 . egu allocations section 454 establishes the procedures for determining-allocations for individual-units that are affected-egus as of december 31 , 2004 . the allocations will be set on a one-time-basis and therefore will remain the same each year . allowances will be allocated to a facility in a given zone in proportion to the sum of the baseline-heat-input values of affected-egus at the facility as compared to the total-baseline-heat input of all affected-egus in the respective-zone . thus , the two separate-allowances-pools for the two zones are separately allocated . each facility 's allocation will be adjusted to ensure that the total-amount of allowances allocated does not exceed the applicable-total amount of allowances available for allocation for the zone for the year involved . while the allowance tracking-system for sulfur-dioxide-allowances was already established for the acid-rain-program , the administrator must , under section 403 , establish by regulation the allowance tracking-system for nitrogen-oxides-allowances . further , the administrator must also promulgate-regulations determining the individual-unit-allocations for a given year . in the event that the administrator is unable , for any reason , to promulgate allocation-regulations on a timely-basis , section 454 provides two default methods for compliance , both of which are implemented separately for the two zones . the first default-method , which is analogous to the default under the new sulfur-dioxide-trading program , applies if the allowance tracking-system regulations are timely-promulgated but not the allocation-regulations . eighty percent of the total-amount of nitrogen-oxides-allowances available for allocation each year will be allocated to acid-rain-program units with coal as their primary or secondary-fuel or residual-oil as their primary-fuel , listed in the administrator 's emissions scorecard 2000 . five percent of the total-amount of allowances available for allocation will be auctioned , and the remaining fifteen percent will not be made available . however , if neither the allowance tracking-system regulations nor the allocation-regulations are timely-promulgated , then the second default applies under which each affected-egu is required for the year involved to meet an emission-rate-limit of 0.14 lb/mmbtu for units in zone 1 or 0.25 lb/mmbtu for units in zone 2 . subpart 3 . ozone-season nox budget program section 461 . definitions section 461 contains definitions unique to the nox sip-call . section 462 . general-provisions section 462 provides that the general-provisions in sections 402 through 406 and section 409 of part a do not apply to this subpart . this is because the nox sip-call itself , and the state-implementation-plans approved under the nox sip-call , already include provisions concerning the matters addressed in these general-provisions in part a , such as tracking and transferring of allowances , permitting , monitoring and reporting , and compliance . section 463 . applicable-implementation-plan section 463 requires implementation of the requirements of the nox sip-call beginning in 2004 including-requirements contained in a proposed-rulemaking by epa concerning : the amounts of the state trading-budgets ; the criteria for classifying-cogeneration-units as egus and non-egus ; and the treatment of states that are only partially in the nox sip-call area . section 464 . termination of nox trading-program for clear skies units section 464 terminates the obligation of the administrator to administer the ozone-season nox budget-trading-program under the nox sip-call on january 1 , 2008 . the section allows states to continue , and to administer , such a program in their state implement plans under the nox sip-call for 2008 and thereafter . however , it is intended that affected-units under the new nitrogen-oxides trading-program will generally not be subject to the requirements of the nox sip-call starting january 1 , 2008 . section 465 . carryforward of pre-2008 nitrogen-oxides-allowances section 465 requires the administrator to promulgate-regulations allowing-owners and operators to carry over , into the new nitrogen-oxides trading-program under subpart 2 , any banked pre-2008 allowances under the nox budget-trading-program administered by the administrator under the nox sip-call . part d. mercury-emissions reductions part d establishes a new trading-program for mercury , with a requirement to hold allowances covering-emissions-beginning january 1 , 2010 . section 471 . definitions section 471 contains the definitions unique to the new mercury-trading-program . the definition of the term `` affected-egu '' establishes which electricity generating-units are covered by the new trading-program . the new mercury-trading-program covers coal-fired-units that are covered by the new sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides trading-programs . the definition for `` adjusted baseline-heat-input '' establishes a modified baseline-heat-input value , which , for units with an operating-history , is adjusted by a standard-factor to reflect the types of coal that were combusted . standard-factors are set forth for several-categories of coal : 3.0 for lignite ; 1.25 for subbituminous ; and 1.0 for bituminous or other fuel . section 472 . applicability section 472 provides that the owner or operator must hold allowances for all the affected-egus at a facility at least equal to the total-mercury-emissions for those units during the year . as in the new sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides trading-programs , compliance with the requirement to hold allowances will thus be determined on a facility-wide-basis . section 473 . limitations on total-emissions-section 463 establishes the annual-caps on mercury-emissions for affected-egus : 26 tons starting in 2010 and 15 tons starting in 2018 . during the first year of the new trading-program , 99 % of the allowances will be allocated to affected-units with an auction for the remaining 1 % . each subsequent-year , an additional 1 % of the allowances for twenty years , and then an additional 2.5 % thereafter , will be auctioned until eventually all the allowances are auctioned . auction-proceeds will go into the u.s. treasury . section 474 . egu allocations section 434 establishes the procedures for determining-allocations for individual-units that are affected-egus as of december 31 , 2004 . the allocations will be set on a one-time-basis and therefore will remain the same each year . allowances will be allocated based on the units ' baseline-heat-input , which , for units with an operating-history , is adjusted by a standard-factor to reflect the types of coal that were combusted . each facility's allocation will be adjusted to ensure that the total-amount of allowances allocated does not exceed the applicable-amount of allowances available for allocation for the year . while the allowance tracking-system for sulfur-dioxide-allowances was already established for the acid-rain-program , the administrator must , under section 403 , establish by regulation the allowance tracking-system for mercury-allowances . further , the administrator must also promulgate-regulations determining the individual-unit-allocations for a given year . in the event that the administrator is unable , for any reason , to promulgate allocation-regulations on a timely-basis , section 474 provides two default methods for compliance-analogous to those under the new nitrogen-oxides trading-program . under the first default , eighty percent of the total-amount of mercury-allowances allocated each year will be allocated to acid-rain-program coal-fired-units listed in the administrator 's emissions scorecard 2000 . five percent of the total-amount of allowances available for allocation will be auctioned , and the remaining fifteen percent will not be made available . however , if neither the allowance tracking-system regulations nor the allocation-regulations are timely-promulgated , then the second default applies under which each affected-egu must comply with an emission-limit of 30 percent of the mercury-content ( in ounces per mmbtu ) of the coal and coal-derived-fuel combusted by the unit . part e. national-emission-standards ; research ; environmental accountability section 481 . national-emission-standards for affected-units section 481 establishes performance-standards for all new boilers , combustion-turbines , and integrated-gasification combined cycle-plants that are affected-units under the new trading-programs . `` new '' units are those that commence construction or reconstruction after enactment . these statutory-performance-standards include emission-limits for four air-pollutants : nitrogen-oxides ; sulfur-dioxide ; mercury ; and particulate-matter . the mercury-emission-limits apply only to coal-fired-units . a particulate-matter emission-limit is established for existing oil-fired-boilers that will also reduce emissions of nickel from such units . all units-subject to a performance-standard are required to monitor emissions using continuous emissions monitoring systems and to use averaging-times similar to those under the existing new source-performance-standards . boilers and integrated-gasification combined cycle-plants are subject to a sulfur-dioxide-emission limit of 2.0 lb/mwh , a nitrogen-oxides emission-limit of 1.0 lb/mwh , and a particulate-matter emission-limit of 0.20 lb/mwh . coal-fired-boilers and integrated-gasification combined cycle-plants are also subject to a mercury-emission-limit of 0.015 lb/gwh , but alternative-standards apply in some circumstances . coal-fired combustion-turbines are subject to the same emission-limits as coal-fired-boilers and integrated-gasification combined cycle-plants . ( the term '' coal-fired '' is defined to include units that burn any coal or coal-derived-fuel . ) gas-fired-combustion turbines are subject to nitrogen-oxides emission-limits ranging from 0.084 lb/mwh to 0.56 lb/mwh . combustion-turbines that are not coal- or gas-fired are subject to nitrogen-oxides emission-limits ranging from 0.289 lb/mwh to 1.01 lb/mwh , a sulfur-dioxide-emission limit of 2.0 lb/mwh , and a particulate-matter emission-limit of 0.20 lb/mwh . existing oil-fired-boilers are subject to a particulate-matter emission-limit of 0.30 lb/mwh . the administrator is required , at least every eight years , to review and , if appropriate revise , these performance-standards to reflect the degree of emission-limitation-achievable through application of the best system of emission-reduction which the administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated . however , such review is not required if the administrator determines that review is not appropriate in light of readily-available information on the efficacy of the standard . new affected-units subject to the performance-standards are not subject to standards under section 111 . section 482 . research , environmental-monitoring , and assessment section 482 contains provisions for evaluating and reporting the efficacy of the new sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and mercury-trading programs and conducting scientific and technical-research and development . one of the purposes of these provisions is production of peerreviewed scientific and technology-information in time to inform the review of emissions-levels as specified in section 410 . section 483 . exemption from major-source reconstruction review-requirements and best-available retrofit control-technology-requirements section 483 exempts affected-units under the new trading-programs from the requirements of new source-review ( nsr ) and best-available retrofit-technology ( bart ) . affected-units under the exemption are no longer considered `` major-emitting-facilities '' or '' major-stationary-sources '' for purposes of parts c and d of title i of the clean-air act . permits issued in the past to comply with the requirements of part c and d of title i , however , will remain in effect . to qualify for the exemption from nsr and bart , an existing affected-unit must meet certain-requirements concerning-particulate matter and carbon-monoxide-emissions . where there is a modification of the existing affected-unit ( which is defined as a change that will result in an increase in the hourly-emissions of a pollutant at the unit 's maximum-capacity ) , the unit must comply with either best-available control-technology ( bact ) for that pollutant or the performance-standards for nitrogen-oxides , sulfur-dioxide , mercury , and particulate-matter under section 481 . in addition , new affected-units constructed after enactment will be required to meet the performance-standards under section 481 , and no additional , case-by-case-review of the appropriate-control-technology , such as bact or the lowest achievable-emission-rate ( laer ) , will be required . an affected-unit located within 50 km of class i areas will remain subject to the requirements in part c of title i for the protection of such areas . for example , emissions resulting from the construction of such a new or modified unit may not cause or contribute to the violation of a class i increment unless the federal-land-manager certifies that the emissions from the facility will have no adverse-impact on the air-quality related values of the class i area . further , as provided under section 110 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( c ) , states must still ensure that the construction of a new or modified affected-unit will not cause or contribute to a violation of the national-ambient-air quality-standards ( naaqs ) or interfere with the programs to assure that the naaqs are met . states must provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the impact of the new or modified affected-unit on the naaqs or on any class i areas within 50 km of the unit . title i of the clean-air act section 107 . transitional-areas the clear skies act revises section 107 of the clean-air act to authorize the administrator to designate as transitional an area for which epa-performed-modeling demonstrates that the area will attain the 8-hour ozone or fine-particles naaqs no later than december 31 , 2015 through the controls provided under the clear skies act and any other federal-controls that have been promulgated . in addition , an area may be classified as transitional if the state performs epaapproved modeling demonstrating that the area will attain the 8-hour ozone or fine-particles naaqs by no later than december 31 , 2015 through a combination of reductions achieved through controls established through the clear skies act and any other federal-controls that have been promulgated , together with any necessary local-controls that the state adopts in its state-implementation-plan no later than december 31 , 2004 . areas designated as transitional will not be subject to certain local-planning-obligations that apply to areas designated nonattainment , such as conformity and new source-review . these areas are subject to the new source-program that applies in attainment and maintenance-areas . in addition , these areas need to ensure that growth in emissions following the time of designation does not negatively affect their ability to attain the standard . finally , if an area fails to attain the standard by december 31 , 2015 , the administrator will be required to redesignate the area to nonattainment and the area will then be subject to the nonattainment-planning-requirements , including-conformity and new source-review . in addition , the time-frames for states to recommend , and epa to promulgate , designations for the 8-hour ozone and fine-particles naaqs are revised to align the time-frames for epa to designate areas for these standards . sections 110 , 126 . ozone-transport provisions the clear skies act restricts the applicability of petitions under section 126 of the clean-air act , and the requirements of the state-implementation-plan ( sip ) `` good-neighbor '' provisions of section 110 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( d ) of the clean-air act , to affected-units under the new trading-programs . in general , section 126 authorizes downwind states or political-subdivisions to petition the administrator to find that certain upwind-sources emit air-pollutants in amounts that contribute significantly to the petitioner 's air-pollution-problems . if the administrator grants the finding , the sources must either shut down or implement controls that the administrator may mandate within a specified-period , but no later than three years from the date of the finding . the clear skies act revises section 126 to provide that if any state submits a section 126 petition concerning emissions from an affected-unit , the administrator may not grant any finding prior to january 1 , 2009 , although the administrator must take final-action during january , 2009 on any petition submitted prior to january 1 , 2007 . further , if the administrator grants a requested finding , then the administrator must assure that the compliance and implementation-deadlines are extended beyond december 31 , 2011 . the clear skies act further requires that , in addressing a petition submitted after enactment that requests a finding for any affected-unit under the new trading-programs , the administrator must consider , among other factors , any emissions-reductions required to occur by any applicable-attainment-dates for any relevant-nonattainment-areas . in addition , as conditions for making a finding concerning affected-units , the administrator must determine that the required-emissions-reductions from the affected-units are at least as cost-effective , and will improve air-quality in the petitioners ' nonattainment-areas at least as cost-effectively , as emissions-reductions from each other principal-category of sources in areas-upwind of the petitioner . the administrator must develop an appropriate-peer-reviewed-methodology for making the necessary-determinations by december 31 , 2006 . corresponding-changes are made in the sip-requirements of section 110 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( d ) . the clear skies act makes clear that these changes do not affect the nox sip-call rulemaking concerning ozone-transport in the eastern u.s. , which requires that certain eastern-states revise their sips to reduce nox-emissions . several-corrections are also made to section 126 , including correction of an erroneous-crossreference . section 112 . maximum achievable-control-technology the clear skies act revises section 112 of the clean-air act to preclude-regulation through maximum achievable-control-technology ( mact ) standards of the emission of hazardous-air-pollutants by electric-utility-steam generating-units . the administrator retains the authority to address any non-mercury hazardous-air-pollutants from electricity generating-units in accordance with the regime-set forth under the existing residual risk authority provisions of section 112 ( f ) ( 2 ) through ( 4 ) . title viii of the clean-air act amendments of 1990 section 821 . monitoring the clear skies act revises section 821 ( a ) of the clean-air act amendments of 1990 to retain the existing carbon dioxide monitoring and reporting-requirements for units-subject to the existing-acid-rain program .
