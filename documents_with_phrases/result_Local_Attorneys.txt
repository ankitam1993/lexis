local-attorneys lend a free hand jane d albritton upon admission to the bar , every colorado lawyer must recite the lawyer 's oath , which states in part : `` i will never reject , from any consideration personal to myself , the cause of the defenseless or the oppressed . '' to that end , attorneys are expected , although not required , to contribute 25 hours a year pro-bono - free - for the common-good . however , the 1998 report of the legal services/pre bono committee , of the judicial advisory council found that the ability of low- and middle-income-coloradans to obtain equal-access to the legal-system has been limited by the number of lawyers available and willing to serve them and by the growing-complexity of the law . the law in northern colorado remains as complex as it is anywhere else , but the willingness of attorneys to take on pro-bono-work in defense of the `` defenseless or oppressed '' appears to be exemplary . generally speaking , there are three routes to equal-access for those who can not afford legal-counsel : the public-defender 's office ( for criminal- cases ) ; legal-services ( federally funded ) ; and the local-bar-associations that coordinate pro-bono-work . both legal-services and the bar-associations complement each other in ways that provide a fairly broad-net of support . despite the population-growth in the area and the uneasiness in the economy , the resilience of this net has proven remarkably-strong . `` the advantage of our program is its predictability , '' said amy rosenberg , chair of the pro-bono project for larimer county . `` every wednesday , we have review and intake in fort collins ; every thursday , we have review and intake in loveland . it is always at the same time and in the same place . '' long history in larimer the work by the larimer county-bar-association has been going on for 18 years , and in that time several thousand clients have been served . during the 51-week period between june 2000 and may 2001 , 250 individuals came through intake in fort collins . of those , 150 got the advice they needed and 33 received-attorney-referrals . in loveland , 23 were assigned attorneys . rosenberg explained that the pro-bono project does not take on criminal-cases , bankruptcies , dependent or neglected children , or fee generating-cases such as personal-injury . `` in personal-injury-cases , an attorney can work for a contingency-fee , '' she said . `` most of our cases involve domestic law . this is an area where we have seen an increase in a need for help . '' in addition to the referrals made through the bar-association , larimer county conducts bar-clinics and classes . `` once a month i instruct a divorce-class , and every other month i teach a class in parental-responsibility ( custody ) or the single parent , '' said kris merkel , pro-bono and legal-aid-coordinator for the larimer county-bar-association . `` we provide all the forms and teach people who come how to handle the process pro se , on their own . '' merkel has noticed that there has been an increase over the past year in domestic-cases . she attributes part of this increase to the fact that people have been moving to colorado in hopes of finding the promised land , as outlined in money magazine . what they have found instead is a minimum-wage-job-market and out-of-sight real estate-prices . to make matters worse , the economy has flattened . `` when the economy goes bad , families that are already struggling tend to fall apart , '' she observed . federally funded legal-services , in both larimer and weld counties , have also felt the pressure of increased domestic dissolution . mario rivera , managing-attorney in the greeley-office , noted that his staff of six has handled 100 more cases in 2001 than in 2000 . `` the highest number of cases for us are domestic , '' he said . `` given our resources , we can only handle the most pressing-cases such as restraining-orders . we are also being inundated by bankruptcies , but in those cases we can only take on cases of workers whose wages are being garnished and who ca n't take care of their basic-needs with what they have left . '' rivera pointed out that helping-clients , many of whom are not native english-speakers , becomes problematic as demands increase and funding to the legal-services corp. remains stagnant . `` the reagan administration cut back funding by a third in 1982 , and then the contract with america cut-funds again , '' he said . `` so we continue to work with a budget that is two-thirds of what it was . '' david bye , rivera 's counterpart in larimer county , works with a staff of seven . he faces the ongoing-quandary of seeing a need for more outreach in the community but lacking the resources to implement it . `` if it had not been for warren rudman ( r-new hampshire ) , the legal-services corp. might have disappeared altogether , '' bye said . `` as it is , we are restricted in how we can proceed . we can not bring class-action-suits , and we can not ask for attorney 's fees when we win a case . those restrictions take a big-bite out of our power . '' work often-challenging both rivera and bye added that despite the pinch in federal support , the generosity of their local-bar-associations and the legal-aid foundation keep the neediest in northern colorado well-represented . but representing this group , a group that often lacks education and legal-sophistication , can challenge even the most-dedicated-attorney . some clients have no phone and no other address but the one at the shelter . `` many of those who come to us do not understand the implications of communications from the court , '' said rosenberg . `` so by the time we get the case , it is a crisis . sometimes it is difficult to talk to a client directly . the attorneys who take on these cases often do so on extremely short-notice . '' she also noted that while an attorney might be taking on a case pro-bono , the implications of handling the case poorly remain constant . `` if you handle the case wrong , you are exposed for damages , '' she said . `` and once you 're on a case , you stay on unless you can get the court 's permission to withdraw . very few realize what a service-attorneys volunteer to the community . '' in part , grants from the colorado lawyers trust-account foundation defray some of the costs associated with maintaining a strong pro-bono , program . these funds cover the salary of the paralegal-coordinator ( kris markel in larimer county ) , telephones , office-supplies and malpractice-insurance . `` the work that our attorneys do is remarkable , '' said rosenberg . `` some-times our clients are not the most agreeable in the world , but this year when i put out forms asking for pro-bono-work , they started coming back by fax almost immediately . '' while the will to assist the low-income-population has not abated in northern colorado , those involved with federally funded legal-services must wait to see who president bush appoints to the board of the legal-services corp. and they hope the spirit of warren rudman will prevail .
