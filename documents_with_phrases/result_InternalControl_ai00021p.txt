november 1999 standards for internal-control in the federal government gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 foreword federal-policymakers and program-managers are continually seeking-ways to better achieve agencies ' missions and program-results , in other words , they are seeking-ways to improve accountability . a key-factor in helping achieve such outcomes and minimize operational-problems is to implement appropriate internal-control . effective internal-control also helps in managing-change to cope with shifting-environments and evolving-demands and priorities . as programs change and as agencies strive to improve operational-processes and implement new technological-developments , management must continually assess and evaluate its internal-control to assure that the control-activities being used are effective and updated when necessary . the federal-managers ' financial-integrity act of 1982 ( fmfia ) requires the general-accounting-office ( gao ) to issue standards for internal-control in government . the standards provide the overall-framework for establishing and maintaining internal-control and for identifying and addressing major-performance and management-challenges and areas at greatest risk of fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement . office of management and budget ( omb ) circular a-123 , management accountability and control , revised june 21 , 1995 , provides the specific-requirements for assessing and reporting on controls . the term internal-control in this document is synonymous with the term-management-control ( as used in omb circular a-123 ) that covers all aspects of an agency's operations ( programmatic , financial , and compliance ) . recently , other laws have prompted renewed focus on internal-control . the government-performance and results act of 1993 requires agencies to clarify their missions , set strategic and annual-performance-goals , and measure and report on performance page 1 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) toward those goals . internal-control plays a significant-role in helping-managers achieve those goals . also , the chief financial-officers act of 1990 calls for financial-management-systems to comply with internal-control-standards , and the federal financial-management-improvement act of 1996 identifies internal-control as an integral part of improving financial-management-systems . rapid-advances in information technology have highlighted the need for updated internal-control-guidance related to modern computer-systems . the management of human-capital has gained recognition as a significant-part of internal-control . furthermore , the private sector has updated its internal-control-guidance with the issuance of internal-control - integrated framework , published by the committee of sponsoring-organizations of the treadway commission ( coso ) . consequently , we have developed this standards update which supersedes our previously issued `` standards for internal-controls in the federal government . '' this update gives greater recognition to the increasing-use of information technology to carry out critical-government-operations , recognizes the importance of human-capital , and incorporates , as appropriate , the relevant updated internal-control-guidance developed in the private sector . the standards are effective beginning with fiscal year 2000 and the federal-managers financial-integrity act reports covering that year . we appreciate the efforts of government officials , public-accounting professionals , and other members of the financial community and academia who provided valuable-assistance in developing these standards . david m. walker comptroller general of the united states introduction definition and objectives the following-definition , objectives , and fundamental-concepts provide the foundation for the internal-control-standards . internal-control is a major-part of managing an organization . it comprises the plans , methods , and procedures used to meet missions , goals , and objectives and , in doing so , supports performance-based-management . internal-control also serves as the first line of defense in safeguarding-assets and preventing and detecting-errors and fraud . in short , internal-control , which is synonymous with management-control , helps government-program-managers achieve desired results through effective-stewardship of public-resources . internal-control should provide reasonable-assurance that the objectives of the agency are being achieved in the following categories : • effectiveness and efficiency of operations including the use of the entity 's resources . • reliability of financial-reporting , including-reports on budget-execution , financial statements , and other reports for internal and external-use . • compliance with applicable-laws and regulations . a subset of these objectives is the safeguarding of assets . internal-control should be designed to provide reasonable-assurance regarding-prevention of or prompt-detection of unauthorized-acquisition , use , or disposition of an agency 's assets . fundamental-concepts the fundamental-concepts provide the underlying-framework for designing and applying the standards . internal-control is a continuous built-in-component of operations internal-control is not one event , but a series of actions and activities that occur throughout an entity 's operations and on an ongoing-basis . internal-control should be recognized as an integral part of each system that management uses to regulate and guide its operations rather than as a separate-system within an agency . in this sense , internal-control is management-control that is built into the entity as a page 5 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) internal-control is effected by people part of its infrastructure to help managers run the entity and achieve their aims on an ongoing-basis . people are what make internal-control-work . the responsibility for good internal-control rests with all managers . management sets the objectives , puts the control-mechanisms and activities in place , and monitors and evaluates the control . however , all personnel in the organization play important-roles in making it happen . internal-control provides reasonable-assurance , not absolute-assurance management should design and implement internal-control based on the related-cost and benefits . no matter how well designed and operated , internal-control can not provide absolute-assurance that all agency-objectives will be met . factors outside the control or influence of management can affect the entity 's ability to achieve all of its goals . for example , human-mistakes , judgment-errors , and acts of collusion to circumvent control can affect meeting-agency objectives . therefore , once in place , internal-control provides reasonable , not absolute , assurance of meeting-agency objectives . internal-control-standards presentation of the standards these standards define the minimum-level of quality acceptable for internal-control in government and provide the basis against which internal-control is to be evaluated . these standards apply to all aspects of an agency 's operations : programmatic , financial , and compliance . however , they are not intended to limit or interfere with duly granted authority related to developing-legislation , rule-making , or other discretionary-policy-making in an agency . these standards provide a general-framework . in implementing these standards , management is responsible for developing the detailed-policies , procedures , and practices to fit their agency's operations and to ensure that they are built into and an integral part of operations . in the following-material , each of these standards is presented in a short , concise-statement . additional information is provided to help managers incorporate the standards into their daily-operations . control-environment a positive-control-environment is the foundation for all other standards . it provides discipline and structure as well as the climate which influences the quality of internal-control . several key-factors affect the control-environment . one factor is the integrity and ethical-values maintained and demonstrated by management and staff . agency-management plays a key role in providing-leadership in this area , especially in setting and maintaining the organization 's ethical-tone , providing-guidance for proper-behavior , removing-temptations for unethical-behavior , and providing-discipline when appropriate . another factor is management 's commitment to competence . all personnel need to possess and maintain a level of competence that allows them to accomplish their assigned duties , as well as understand the importance of developing and implementing good internal-control . management needs to identify appropriate-knowledge and skills needed for various-jobs and provide needed training , as well as candid and constructive-counseling , and performance-appraisals . page 8 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) management 's philosophy and operating-style also affect the environment . this factor determines the degree of risk the agency is willing to take and management 's philosophy towards performance-based-management . further , the attitude and philosophy of management toward information-systems , accounting , personnel functions , monitoring , and audits and evaluations can have a profound-effect on internal-control . another factor affecting the environment is the agency's organizational-structure . it provides management 's framework for planning , directing , and controlling-operations to achieve agency-objectives . a good internal-control-environment requires that the agency 's organizational-structure clearly define key areas of authority and responsibility and establish appropriate-lines of reporting . the environment is also affected by the manner in which the agency-delegates-authority and responsibility throughout the organization . this delegation covers authority and responsibility for operating activities , reporting-relationships , and authorization-protocols . good human-capital-policies and practices are another critical environmental-factor . this includes establishing appropriate practices for hiring , orienting , training , evaluating , counseling , promoting , compensating , and disciplining-personnel . it also includes providing a proper-amount of supervision . a final-factor affecting the environment is the agency's relationship with the congress and central-oversight-agencies such as omb . congress mandates the programs that agencies undertake and monitors their progress and central-agencies provide policy and guidance on many different-matters . in addition , page 9 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) risk-assessment inspectors-general and internal senior-management-councils can contribute to a good overall-control-environment . a precondition to risk-assessment is the establishment of clear , consistent-agency-objectives . risk-assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant-risks associated with achieving the objectives , such as those defined in strategic and annual-performance-plans developed under the government-performance and results act , and forming a basis for determining how risks should be managed . management needs to comprehensively identify risks and should consider all significant-interactions between the entity and other parties as well as internal-factors at both the entitywide and activity-level . risk identification-methods may include qualitative and quantitative ranking-activities , management-conferences , forecasting and strategic-planning , and consideration of findings from audits and other assessments . once risks have been identified , they should be analyzed for their possible-effect . risk-analysis generally includes estimating the risk 's significance , assessing the likelihood of its occurrence , and page 10 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) control-activities deciding how to manage the risk and what actions should be taken . the specific risk-analysis methodology used can vary by agency because of differences in agencies ' missions and the difficulty in qualitatively and quantitatively assigning-risk-levels . because governmental , economic , industry , regulatory , and operating-conditions continually change , mechanisms should be provided to identify and deal with any special-risks prompted by such changes . control-activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that enforce management 's directives , such as the process of adhering to requirements for budget-development and execution . they help ensure that actions are taken to address risks . control-activities are an integral part of an entity's planning , implementing , reviewing , and accountability for stewardship of government-resources and achieving effective-results . control-activities occur at all levels and functions of the entity . they include a wide-range of diverse-activities such as approvals , authorizations , verifications , reconciliations , performance-reviews , page 11 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) examples of control-activities maintenance of security , and the creation and maintenance of related-records which provide evidence of execution of these activities as well as appropriate-documentation . control-activities may be applied in a computerized-information-system environment or through manual-processes . activities may be classified by specific-control-objectives , such as ensuring-completeness and accuracy of information-processing . there are certain-categories of control-activities that are common to all agencies . examples include the following : page 12 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) top-level-reviews of actual-performance reviews by management at the functional or activity-level management of human-capital controls over information-processing management should track major-agency-achievements and compare these to the plans , goals , and objectives established under the government-performance and results act . managers also need to compare actual-performance to planned or expected-results throughout the organization and analyze significant-differences . effective-management of an organization 's workforce-its human capital-is essential to achieving-results and an important part of internal-control . management should view human-capital-as an asset rather than a cost . only when the right-personnel for the job are on board and are provided the right-training , tools , structure , incentives , and responsibilities is operational-success possible . management should ensure that skill-needs are continually assessed and that the organization is able to obtain a workforce that has the required-skills that match those necessary to achieve organizational-goals . training should be aimed at developing and retaining employee skill-levels to meet changing organizational-needs . qualified and continuous-supervision should be provided to ensure that internal-control-objectives are achieved . performance evaluation and feedback , supplemented by an effective-reward system , should be designed to help employees understand the connection between their performance and the organization's success . as a part of its human-capital-planning , management should also consider how best to retain valuable-employees , plan for their eventual-succession , and ensure continuity of needed skills and abilities . a variety of control-activities are used in information-processing . examples include edit-checks of data entered , accounting for transactions in numerical-sequences , comparing-file totals with control page 13 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) physical-control over vulnerable-assets establishment and review of performance-measures and indicators segregation of duties proper-execution of transactions and events accounts , and controlling-access to data , files , and programs . further guidance on control-activities for information-processing is provided below under `` control-activities specific for information-systems . '' an agency must establish physical-control to secure and safeguard vulnerable-assets . examples include security for and limited-access to assets such as cash , securities , inventories , and equipment which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorized-use . such assets should be periodically counted and compared to control-records . activities need to be established to monitor performance-measures and indicators . these controls could call for comparisons and assessments relating different-sets of data to one another so that analyses of the relationships can be made and appropriate-actions taken . controls should also be aimed at validating the propriety and integrity of both organizational and individual-performance measures and indicators . key-duties and responsibilities need to be divided or segregated among different-people to reduce the risk of error or fraud . this should include separating the responsibilities for authorizing transactions , processing and recording them , reviewing the transactions , and handling any related-assets . no one individual should control all key-aspects of a transaction or event . transactions and other significant-events should be authorized and executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority . this is the principal-means of assuring that only valid transactions to exchange , transfer , use , or commit resources and other events are initiated or entered page 14 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) accurate and timely-recording of transactions and events access-restrictions to and accountability for resources and records appropriate-documentation of transactions and internal-control into . authorizations should be clearly communicated to managers and employees . transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in controlling-operations and making-decisions . this applies to the entire-process or life-cycle of a transaction or event from the initiation and authorization through its final-classification in summary-records . in addition , control-activities help to ensure that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded . access to resources and records should be limited to authorized individuals , and accountability for their custody and use should be assigned and maintained . periodic-comparison of resources with the recorded accountability should be made to help reduce the risk of errors , fraud , misuse , or unauthorized-alteration . internal-control and all transactions and other significant-events need to be clearly documented , and the documentation should be readily-available for examination . the documentation should appear in management-directives , administrative-policies , or operating-manuals and may be in paper or electronic-form . all documentation and records should be properly managed and maintained . these examples are meant only to illustrate the range and variety of control-activities that may be useful to agency-managers . they are not all-inclusive and may not include particular control-activities that an agency may need . furthermore , an agency 's internal-control should be flexible to allow agencies to tailor control-activities to fit their special-needs . the specific-control-activities used by a given agency may be different from those page 15 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) control-activities specific for information-systems general-control • used by others due to a number of factors . these could include specific-threats they face and risks they incur ; differences in objectives ; managerial-judgment ; size and complexity of the organization ; operational-environment ; sensitivity and value of data ; and requirements for system-reliability , availability , and performance . there are two broad-groupings of information-systems-control - general-control and application-control . general-control applies to all information-systems-mainframe , minicomputer , network , and end-user-environments . application-control is designed to cover the processing of data within the application-software . this category includes entitywide security-program planning , management , control over data-center-operations , system-software acquisition and maintenance , access-security , and application-system-development and maintenance . more specifically : data center and client-server-operations-controls include backup and recovery-procedures , and contingency and disaster-planning . in addition , data-center-operations controls also include job-set-up and scheduling-procedures and controls over operator activities . application-control • system-software control includes control over the acquisition , implementation , and maintenance of all system-software including the operating system , data-based-management-systems , telecommunications , security-software , and utility programs . • access-security-control protects the systems and network from inappropriate-access and unauthorized-use by hackers and other trespassers or inappropriate-use by agency-personnel . specific-control-activities include frequent-changes of dial-up-numbers ; use of dial-back-access ; restrictions on users to allow access only to system-functions that they need ; software and hardware `` firewalls '' to restrict access to assets , computers , and networks by external persons ; and frequent-changes of passwords and deactivation of former-employees ' passwords . • application-system-development and maintenance-control provides the structure for safely developing new systems and modifying existing-systems . included are documentation-requirements ; authorizations for undertaking-projects ; and reviews , testing , and approvals of development and modification-activities before placing-systems into operation . an alternative to in-house development is the procurement of commercial-software , but control is necessary to ensure that selected software meets the user's needs , and that it is properly placed into operation . this category of control is designed to help ensure completeness , accuracy , authorization , and validity of all transactions during application-processing . control should be installed at an application 's interfaces with other systems to ensure that all inputs are received and are valid and outputs are correct and properly distributed . an example is computerized-edit checks built into the system to review the format , existence , and reasonableness of data . page 17 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) general and application-control over computer-systems are interrelated . general-control supports the functioning of application-control , and both are needed to ensure complete and accurate-information-processing . if the general-control is inadequate , the application-control is unlikely to function properly and could be overridden . because information-technology-changes rapidly , controls must evolve to remain effective . changes in technology and its application to electronic-commerce and expanding-internet applications will change the specific-control-activities that may be employed and how they are implemented , but the basic-requirements of control will not have changed . as more powerful computers place more responsibility for data-processing in the hands of the end-users , the needed controls should be identified and implemented . information and communications for an entity to run and control its operations , it must have relevant , reliable , and timely-communications relating to internal as well as external-events . information is needed throughout the agency to achieve all of its objectives . program-managers need both operational and financial-data to determine whether they are meeting their agencies ' strategic and annual-performance-plans and meeting their goals for accountability for effective and efficient-use of resources . for example , operating-information is required for development of financial-reports . this covers a broad-range of data from purchases , subsidies , and other transactions to data on fixed assets , inventories , and receivables . operating-information is also needed to determine whether the agency is achieving its compliance-requirements under various-laws and regulations . financial information is needed for both external and internal-uses . it is required to develop financial statements for periodic external-reporting , and , on a day-to-day-basis , to make operating-decisions , montinor-performance , and allocate resources . pertinent-information should be identified , captured , and distributed in a form and time frame that permits people to perform their duties efficiently . effective-communications should occur in a broad-sense with information flowing down , across , and up the organization . in additional to internal-communications , management should ensure there are adequate-means of communicating with , and obtaining-information from , external-stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals . moreover , effective-information technology-management is critical to achieving useful , reliable , and continuous-recording and communication of information . monitoring internal-control should generally be designed to assure that ongoing-monitoring occurs in the course of normal-operations . it is performed continually and is ingrained in the agency 's operations . it includes regular-management and supervisory-activities , comparisons , reconciliations , and other actions-people take in performing their duties . separate-evaluations of control can also be useful by focusing directly on the controls ' effectiveness at a specific-time . the scope and frequency of separate-evaluations should depend primarily on the assessment of risks and the effectiveness of ongoing-monitoring procedures . separate-evaluations may take the form of self-assessments as well as review of control-design and direct-testing of internal-control . separate-evaluations also may be performed by the agency inspector-general or an external-auditor . deficiencies found during ongoing-monitoring or through separate-evaluations should be communicated to the individual responsible for the function and also to at least one level of management above that individual . serious-matters should be reported to top-management . monitoring of internal-control should include policies and procedures for ensuring that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved . managers are to ( 1 ) promptly evaluate findings from page 20 gao/aimd-00-21.3.1 ( 11/99 ) audits and other reviews , including those showing-deficiencies and recommendations reported by auditors and others who evaluate agencies ' operations , ( 2 ) determine proper-actions in response to findings and recommendations from audits and reviews , and ( 3 ) complete , within established time-frames , all actions that correct or otherwise resolve the matters brought to management 's attention . the resolution-process begins when audit or other review-results are reported to management , and is completed only after action has been taken that ( 1 ) corrects identified deficiencies , ( 2 ) produces improvements , or ( 3 ) demonstrates the findings and recommendationsdo not warrant management-action . ordering-information the first copy of each gao report
