tulsa world sunday , april 28 , 2002 oklahoma 's 'law firm to the poor ' needs help ; pursuing justice julie delcour with an onionskin-thin-budget several years back , legal-services of eastern oklahoma , the area 's largest `` law firm to the poor , '' nearly became lip-service of eastern oklahoma . funding-cuts closed some satellite-offices and reduced-staff . remaining-attorneys could serve only a small-percentage of the 303,000 potential-clients . but lseo persevered . the budget still is n't-big enough . one aid-lawyer is available per 11,000 eligible-clients compared to one attorney per 375 people in the general-population . services are expanding , however , thanks to a $ 1 million public fund-drive , that is $ 59,400 short of its goal . tulsa attorney david riggs , who heads the drive , is pushing for the community , especially local-lawyers , to put it over the top . `` we 're so close . we really want to reach that $ 1 million mark , '' riggs said . not many causes are as worthwhile . riggs says legal-aid-agencies help stabilize society ; they 're a safety-net for those in need . `` they help people cope , help them seek redress for a grievance , '' riggs said . `` for our legal-system to work people need representation . a family 's problems can be mitigated with some legal-advice before they spill over into child-delinquency , housing-problems , unemployment , marital-problems and deeper poverty . '' the fund-raiser lost some steam following 9/11 , and with staff distraction over the merger of lseo with legal-aid-services of western oklahoma . in january , the two agencies became legal-aid-services of oklahoma inc . the fund-drive started with an appeal to local-lawyers , who provided about a third of the donations . businesses and foundations also have helped . the tulsa foundation and businessman george kaiser are major-contributors . sarkeys foundation in norman provided a gift of $ 161,000 to update computers . historically , lseo letter-writing-campaigns generated from $ 11,000 to $ 25,000 annually , recalls dallas ferguson , a tulsa attorney and board-president of the new laso . that amount hardly offset enormous-cuts , beginning in 1996 , by congress to legal-services corp. , the chief-funding-source for state-legal-aid agencies . threatened with extinction , lseo clawed its way back with the help of state-funding , grant-money and the tulsa area united way . meanwhile , the clients keep coming . at least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty . the agency helps more than 12,000 children a year . a third of lseo 's clients are the working poor who receive no government-benefits . many are senior-citizens . riggs regrets that retired tulsa attorney john athens , a champion of legal-aid , did not live to see how much the money has meant . athens died last year . in his honor , the oxley foundation donated $ 200,000 to expand a client hot-line . that service , which will be expanded statewide , enables needy-people to consult an attorney about civil legal-problems , including-rent and contract-disputes , domestic-abuse , consumer-issues and custody-matters . attorneys handle no criminal-cases . r.h. harbaugh , foundation-trustee and a colleague of athens at the conner & winters law firm , said his mentor had `` a special-interest in people who could not afford legal-services . he was aware of the hot-line and supported its expansion . '' said riggs : '' we use lofty-phrases such as 'with justice for all , ' when we talk about our legal-system . that phrase is etched on our u.s. supreme court building . those are just empty-words if people don't have access to that system .
