b285663 facility-design review area discussed in the study , as well as the efforts that have been made by federal-agencies to address the conditions covered in the study . results in brief according to the ffc study , opportunities exist to significantly reduce total-project cost ( tpc ) by conducting an effective-design-review process . the study found that effective-design-review practices result in less rework on the part of the construction-contractor , fewer change-orders to correct design-errors and omissions , and lowering the cost of belatedly adding-project-upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original-design . ffc reported that , historically , 30 to 50 percent of all construction-change-orders result from errors in the design-documents directly related to improper-interfaces between design-disciplines ( civil , structural , architectural , electrical , and mechanical ) . the ffc study notes that attention should be focused on review of designs during the conceptual-planning and design-phases , where the ability to influence ultimate-functionality and cost of the project is the greatest . the study states that the potential savings resulting from conducting effective-design-reviews range from a minimum of 3 percent to as much as 20 percent of tpc , and even higher when indirect-savings are taken into account . the ffc study concludes that , in the end , effective-review of designs maximizes the probability that a mission or operational-requirement will be successfully supported by a facility that was conceived , designed , constructed , and placed into operation efficiently and effectively . the study identifies 18 best-practices that federal-agencies and other facility-owners can use to manage and/or oversee design-reviews throughout the facility-acquisition-process . it organized the best-practices into five categories related to ( 1 ) the role of the owner , ( 2 ) teamwork and collaboration , ( 3 ) advance-planning , ( 4 ) process , and ( 5 ) benchmarking . background ffc ( formerly the federal construction council ) is a continuing activity of the board on infrastructure and the constructed environment of the national research council ( nrc ) . it is a cooperative-association of 20 federal-agencies with interests and responsibilities related to all aspects of facility-design , acquisition , management , maintenance , and evaluation . ffc is convened under the aegis of nrc , the operating-arm of the national academies . its mission is to identify and advance-technologies , processes , and management-practices that improve the performance of federal-facilities over their entire-life-cycle , from planning to disposal . the federal-agencies that sponsored the facility-design review-study , which was produced as an element of the ffc 's 1999 technical activities program , included the • department of the air force , office of the civil-engineer ; • department of the air force , air national guard ( ang ) ; • department of the army , assistant chief of staff for installation management ; • department of energy ( doe ) ; • department of the navy , naval facilities engineering command ( navfac ) ; • department of state ( dos ) , office of foreign buildings operations ; b285663 • department of veterans affairs ( va ) , office of facilities management ; • food and drug administration ; • general services administration ( gsa ) , public-buildings service ; • indian health service ( ihs ) ; • international broadcasting bureau ; • national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , facilities engineering division ; • national institutes of health ( nih ) ; • national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , building and fire research laboratory ; • national science foundation ; • smithsonian institution , office of facilities services ; and • u.s . postal-service ( usps ) . ffc 's study discusses the results of a questionnaire-survey of nine federal-agencies that acquire , maintain , and operate a significant-inventory of buildings and other constructed facilities in supporting their mission.2 questionnaires were answered by agency-headquarters senior facilities engineering program-directors and fieldactivitylevel-project-managers . in addition , ffc used the results from research done by the business roundtable ( tbr ) , nrc , u. s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) , construction-industry institute ( cii ) ,3 and other ffc efforts , as well as others , to augment the study . a literature-search was used to identify facility-acquisition-practices and industry-trends , as well as best-practices and technologies being used to provide adequate-management and oversight of design-reviews . supplemental-information was obtained through interviews with various-public agencies , private sector facility-owners , trade and professional-organizations , and a/e firms in order to characterize the current-state of the art from a broader perspective . the federal government , the nation 's largest building-owner , acquires buildings and other structures to support specific-functions and missions and the general-conduct of its business . it spends more than $ 20 billion a year for facility-design , construction , and related-services . owners , the government included , traditionally have maintained some level of internal facility-planning and design-oversight-capability to ensure that new facilities acceptably balance the factors of cost , schedule , quality , and performance . over the last decade , as a result of efforts to reduce the size of government , agencies have downsized their design and engineering-staffs and relied more on outside-consultants for technical-expertise . although agencies have generally retained their design-oversight responsibilities , fewer staff-resources are now devoted to reviewing-facility-designs . the changes in the facilities acquisition-environment led ffc to conclude that a review of issues , practices , and methods related to the design-phase of the acquisition-process would be beneficial . 2 the report was authored by ralph s. spillinger in conjunction with the ffc standing-committee on organizational-performance and metrics . mr. spillinger is a retired federal-official with 30 years experience in planning , design , and construction of federal-facilities with the navy and nasa . 3 cii 's membership includes several federal-agenciesgsa , usace , navfac , nasa , dos , nist , and the tennessee valley authority . b285663 ffc findings the core-issues of the ffc study-concern the value added by design-review-processes and the appropriate-role of facilities-owners , particularly federal-agencies , in such processes . in developing a detailed scope of work for its study , ffc found that no two of the sponsoring-agencies defined the design-review-process and its elements in exactly the same way . nor was a common-start or end-point identified for design-review . in view of the lack of commonly accepted definitions of the elements , duration , and substance of the design-review-process , ffc decided to focus on practices for reviewing-facility-design over the entire-facility-acquisition process . the study viewed-design-review as a multiphased-process not limited to the reviewing of designs during the design-phase of the acquisition . the objective of the study was to identify a range of best-practices and technologies that could be used by federal-agencies and other owners to provide adequate-management and oversight of design-reviews throughout the facility-acquisition-process . briefly , the ffc study presents five key-findings on design-review-processes . • effective-design-review processes add value by saving time and money over the entire-facilities-acquisition process . effective-design-review processes result in the preparation of more comprehensive and accurate-design and construction-documents that , in turn , result in lower project-construction-costs . areas of savings include less rework on the part of the construction-contractor , fewer change-orders to the owner for correction of design-errors or omissions , and a lowering of the cost of belatedly adding-project-upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original-design . indirect-cost-savings can be realized by avoiding-costs associated with loss of productivity during constructiondelayed-facility-startup , and with litigation . in short , effective-review of designs maximizes the probability that a business-requirement will be successfully supported by a facility that was conceived , designed , constructed , and placed into operation efficiently and effectively . • the team responsible for design-oversight should include representatives of all project-stakeholders : owner , user , a/e , construction-contractor , operation and maintenance-staff , and major-equipment vendors . the team should participate in and contribute to designrelated activities associated with each phase of the facility-acquisition-process , from conceptual-planning through startup . • the use of metrics by federal-agencies to measure the value added by design-review-processes is not well established . although research has been done by the construction-industry institute and other organizations to identify metrics that may be used to measure both the efficiency and the effectiveness of each phase of the facility-acquisition-process , the extent to which individual federal-agencies measure design-review-processes and analyze results is highly-variable . b285663 • to provide effective-oversight of design-review-processes , the owner 's interests are best served when the inhouse-staff can fulfill the functions of a `` smart-buyer . a smart-buyer is one who retains an inhouse-staff who understands the organization 's mission , its requirements , and its customer-needs , and who can translate those needs and requirements into corporate-direction . a smart-buyer also retains the requisite capabilities and technical-knowledge to lead and conduct teaming-activities , accurately define the technical-services needed , recognize value during the acquisition of such technical-services , and evaluate the quality of services ultimately provided . as long as the owner retains the inhouse-capabilities to operate as a smart-buyer of facilities , there does not appear to be any greater risk from contracting out a broad-range of design-reviewrelated functions , so long as such functions are widely-available from a competitive-commercial marketplace . if the owner does not have the capacity to operate as a smart-buyer , the owner-risks project-schedule and cost-overruns and facilities that do not meet performance-objectives . • the ongoing-revolution in information technology and communications offers opportunities to improve design-review-processes . examples include audio and video-teleconferencing , immediate and widespread-data-distribution via the internet , computeraided-design and drafting , and a wide-range of project-management-software . emerging-technologies , such as the use of holographic-projection-techniques to create threeand fourdimensional-models of project-designs , guarantee a continuing-stream of future-enhancements . the ffc study identifies 18 best-practices for the review of designs , which it summarized as follows : role of the owner • be a smart-buyer . • develop a scope of work that clearly and accurately defines the owner 's expectations regarding-cost , schedule , performance , and quality . • avoid the temptation to micromanage the design-review-process . teamwork and collaboration • use teambuilding and partnering-techniques . • ensure that all interested parties participate in design-review-processes . • use the same a/e throughout the process . • use senior , experienced-staff to evaluate the evolving-design and guide the review-process . • commit for the duration of the activity . • participate in a design-awards-program . b285663 advance-planning • focus attention at the front-end during the conceptual-planning and design-phases , where the ability to influence the ultimate-cost of the project is the greatest . • do not start the final-stage of design until the preliminary-engineering is complete . process • tailor the review-approach to project-specifics . • keep up the pace of the process to maintain momentum . • pay special-attention to civil , structural , architectural , electrical , and mechanical-interfaces . • exploit technology . • conduct a postoccupancy-evaluation to develop a lessonslearned-document . benchmarking • measure-results achieved by the design-process . • document both unusually-good and bad-performance . ffc 's study identifies four areas where it was felt that additional-cooperation , research , and discussion could lead to either fundamentally new approaches or significant-improvements to current-practices . these areas are • establishment of a seniorlevel advisory-group on federal-facilities issues ; • identification of a set of metrics that could be used to measure-performance across all phases of the facility-acquisition-process ; • evaluation of current-practices of federal-agencies with regard to the standards , guidelines , and policies supplied to a/es in support of facility-acquisition-activities ; and • study of the potential-benefits of establishing a peer-review-process for agency design-review-practices . the study also identifies a number of federal-agency-initiatives related to the design-review-process . these initiatives are included in the enclosure to this letter , which provides a more detailed-presentation of pertinent-information extracted from the ffc study relating to the changing-facilities-acquisition environment confronting federal-agencies-today , facility-acquisition-practices and trends , and best-practices . government/industry forum on may 24 , 2000 , ffc sponsored a government/industry forum on best-practices for reviewing-facility-designs . approximately 120 individuals from 30 federal-agencies registered to attend the forum . the major-participants were gsa , all branches of the department of defense , dos , doe , nasa , and the smithsonian institution . the forum highlighted identified best-practices and tools that can be used by federal-agencies and other facility-owners to manage and/or oversee design-reviews throughout the facility b285663 acquisition-process . the findings and 18 best-practices highlighted in the ffcsponsored-study were presented to the forum-participants by ffc . government and industry-practitioners discussed best-practices , tools , and processes they have used or seen used to review facility-designs , and suggested how federal-agencies could use such tools and processes to foster quality design . in addition , presentations were made on three systems that have been developed to support different-aspects of the design-review-process . these design-review-tools were the army 's drchecks software-program for documenting , collecting , distributing , and archiving design-review comments ; the construction-industry institute 's ( cii ) project-definition rating index for preproject-planning ; and the redicheck interdisciplinary-coordination-system for design-reviews-the first system designed specifically to correct the interdisciplinary-coordination-discrepancies that account for about half of the construction-change-orders involving errors and omissions . ffc comments on may 24 , 2000 , we asked both the ffc staff director and the primary-author of the ffc study to review and comment on a draft of this letter and enclosure i . both concurred with our presentation of the information . in her letter dated june 7

support specific-functions and missions and the general-conduct of its business . confronted with a requirement to acquire a building or other constructed facility , owner-organizations , both public and private , traditionally participate in a multiphased-process involving conceptual-planning , design , procurement , construction , and startup . throughout this process , owners usually maintain some level of design-oversight to ensure that the acquired facility is an acceptable-balance of cost , schedule , quality , and performance . until the 1990s , federal-agencies often maintained an inhouse facilities-engineering-organization , comprised in part of architects and engineers , responsible for both the technical-aspects and the oversight of the planning and design-phases of the acquisition-process . as a result of executive and legislative initiatives to reduce the size of the government , federal-agencies have downsized their design and engineering-staff . agencies are increasingly using outside-consultants to provide technical-expertise for the planning and design-phases of both new projects and major-renovations of existing-facilities . although oversight responsibility for the facility-planning and design-phases generally remains within the agencies , fewer staff-resources are being devoted to the effort than in the past . concurrent with downsizing , procurement-regulations have been modified to allow agencies greater flexibility and choice in selecting-contracting-methods for acquiring-facilities . as recently as 5 years ago , the designbidbuild-method of facility-acquisition was used almost exclusively . today , agencies increasingly rely on designbuild , construction-management , and program-management contracting-methods . further , advances in computeraided-design and other technologies are occurring defining design-review simultaneously with process-changes in federal-agencies , increasing the importance of technology-support in the design-process . prior to developing a detailed scope of work for the study , the sponsor-agencies shared-information on their own design-review-processes and the design-review-processes of some private-sector-organizations with which they were familiar . analysis of this information revealed that no two of these organizations defined the design-review-process and its various-elements in exactly the same manner . nor was a common-start or end-point identified for design-review as an element of the facility-acquisition-process . for some organizations , design-review was limited to reviewing a consultantprepared-schematic-design to ensure that it met the owner organization 's functional-requirements for floor-area , functional adjacencies and connections , and budget . for other organizations , design-review primarily involved reviewing a more detailed-facility design prepared by an inhouse-design-team or a private a/e firm under contract . the level of the review and the elements reviewed-for-example , architectural-reviews , mechanical and electrical interface-reviews , or constructability1-reviews-also varied . some processes were formal , incorporating-design-reviews at specific-design-milestones ( such as at 15 , 30 , and 60 percent of design-completion ) . others were less formal , relying on periodic-meetings between the owner and the design-team to review the progress being made toward preparation of final construction-contract plans and specifications . the core-issues of the ffc study concerned the valueadded of design-study purpose and review-processes and the appropriate-level of oversight for owners of objective-facilities , particularly federal-agencies , in such processes . ffc 's objective was to identify a range of best-practices and technologies that can be used by federal-agencies and other owners to provide adequate-management and oversight of design-reviews throughout the facility-acquisition-process . specifically , it sought to provide answers to the following-questions : • what is the valueadded of design-review-processes ? • how do ( and how can ) federal-agencies measure the valueadded ? 1 in constructability-reviews , experienced-construction-managers look for such items as inappropriate-materials , physical-barriers , and complex-interfaces that will unnecessarily complicate the construction-phase . page 9 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews • what is the role of inhouse-staff , and what value do they add to design-review-processes ? • what functions are being ( and should be ) contracted to outside-consultants ? • what skills and resources do federal-agencies need to provide effective-oversight of design-review-processes ? • what risks and liabilities do federal-agencies face in outsourcing most or all of their design-review functions ? • how can new and emerging-technologies be integrated into design-review-processes ? the process of acquiring a facility usually includes five phases that can be generalized as conceptual-planning , design , procurement , construction , practices and industry and startup . the contracting-method used will determine whether the five phases occur in sequence or if some phases occur concurrently . the contracting-method can also affect who is involved at each phase ( a/e , construction-contractor , etc. ) . for example , using the designbidbuild-contract-method , the five phases generally occur in sequence with the a/e involved in the design-phase and a construction-contractor in the construction-phase . a designbuild-acquisition , in contrast , will use the same contractor for the design and construction-phases , thus allowing some phases and activities to occur concurrently . regardless of the contracting-method used , the acquisition of a facility will necessarily involve activities and decisions related to all five phases . during the conceptual-planning-phase various-feasibility-studies are done to define the scope or statement of work based on the owner 's expectations for facility-performance , quality , cost , and schedule . several alternative-design-solutions can be considered during this phase , leading up to the selection of a single preferred-approach . the preferred-approach may be a schematic that includes functional-requirements , such as square-footage-estimates for various-functions and adjacencies or connections to functions that are desirable or required . the design-phase usually starts once the statement of work and preferred-design-approach have been developed . from the schematic , the design matures into final-construction-documents comprising the plans and specifications from which equipment-procurement and construction-bids can be solicited . estimated-facility-cost and schedule-issues receive increasingly intense-review during the design-phase so that the owner has a high level of confidence prior to bid that the performance , quality , cost , and schedule-objectives defined during the conceptual-planning-phase can be met . complex-facility-projects usually include a procurement-phase in order to expedite the purchase , manufacture , and delivery of longleadtime-equipment , such as unique-process-machinery , large electrical and mechanical-equipment , and sophisticated architectural-components . such equipment-procurement may proceed in parallel with construction-phase-activities , so that the owner ultimately is able to furnish longleadtime-equipment to the construction-contractor in a timely manner , thus avoiding construction-delays attributable to late-equipment-delivery . early in the construction-phase a formal-construction-management plan is developed describing the intended-sequence and method of construction-activity as well as the relationships , responsibilities , and authorities of all involved-parties ( owner , user , a/e , construction-contractor , specialty-contractors , and relevant-consultants ) . the biggest challenge during the construction-phase is managing-changes resulting from such sources as scope of work-changes by the owner , errors and omissions in the construction-documents , and unknown or changed-site-conditions . the construction-phase is considered complete when the owner accepts occupancy of the facility , although final-completion of construction may continue for months ( or even years ) until all discrepancies have been identified , resolved , and mutually agreed upon . the startup-phase , sometimes called commissioning , begins with occupancy of the facility by its user . building-components are tested individually and then together with other components in order to measure and compare their performance against the original-design criteria . facility-operation and maintenance-plans are implemented , tested , and refined as appropriate . during the last 20 years , change has been particularly pronounced with downsizing of facility regard to how corporate and government-owners manage the acquisition engineering-organizations of facilities and other projects . as noted by tbr in a 1997 white-paper , '' virtually all major-firms have reduced the size and scope of work performed by engineering-organizations . many firms are drifting because they are uncertain about the appropriate-size and role of their inhouse capital projects organization . nearly every owner 's engineering and project-management-organization in the u.s. has been reorganized , sometimes repeatedly , without achieving a satisfactory-result in many cases . `` 2 since 1970 , owner-engineering-downsizing has resulted in increased use of contractors to perform design and construction functions . graphs published by tbr , based on data compiled by independent project 2 the business-stake in effective project systems ( washington , d.c. : tbr , 1997 ) . analysis ( ipa ) of reston , va , for more than 2,000 projects from a variety of industries , show a decline in the percentage of major projects designed by owners ' inhouse-staff from about 30 percent during 19701975 to about 25 percent during 19811985 , to less than 10 percent after 1991 . many owners originally identified the project-definition activity as a core competency.3 however , ipa 's data indicate that project-definition , too , is increasingly being outsourced . data compiled through 1997 by cii , closely correlates with tbr data.4 fortunately , an increasingly-competitive , productive , sophisticated , and capable-facility-design and construction-industry is capable and willing to take on this increased-workload . unfortunately , this trend has not reduced owners ' overall-engineering costs as a percentage of tpc.5 the engineering-share of tpc has increased over the past 20 years from 13 to 20 percent . the interpretation of this increase is controversial : it is not clear if the increase reflects an increased cost of outsourced engineering or simply the cost of increased intensity of engineering required by today 's technologydriven-projects and more sophisticated-design and construction-practices . since 1993 , federal-regulations have been modified to allow agencies contracting-methods greater flexibility and choice in the contract-methods used for acquiring-facilities . downsizing and the increased outsourcing of design and construction-services have provided the impetus for selecting-methods other than the traditional-designbidbuild contract-method . although there are many variations , current-practice recognizes four basic-categories of contract-types that apply to several facility-acquisition-systems : • general-contract , • construction-management , • designbuild , and • program-management . 3 core-competency is defined as an essential-skill that should be retained within the organization in order to perform effectively . 4 benchmarking and metrics summary for 1997 , benchmarking and metrics committee ( austin , texas : the university of texas at austin , 1998 ) . 5 tpc is defined as the sum-total of all costs associated with a project 's planning , development , design , construction , outfitting , and startup , not including-land-costs . page 12 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews general-contract-approach construction-management-approach • • designbuild-contract-approach the general-contract-approach assumes that the owner-contracts individually for all engineering and construction-services required to acquire a facility . this is the traditional-approach that most largescale-owners ( both public and private ) used to design and construct their facilities until the relatively-recent growth of interest in outsourcing of design and construction-services . it is illustrative of the designbidbuild-contract-method used by federal-agencies . under this approach , the owner manages individual-contracts with all design , engineering , and construction-service-providers , implying that the owner must also manage all interfaces between service providers . interface management becomes critical because assessment of accountability for problems incurred during the project 's evolution is difficult due to the variety and separation of individual-contracts . to succeed , such a process requires a relatively-large and experienced-facility-design , engineering , and management-staff within the owner 's organization in order to protect the owner 's interests . under the construction-management-approach , the owner-contracts with an outside-firm to manage the construction of a project . the construction-manager ( cm ) may function either as an `` agency '' cm , or as an `` atrisk '' cm . agency cm : the owner holds all individual-construction contracts , and the cm functions as the construction-contract administrator , acting on behalf of the owner and rendering an account of activities . the cm is typically not responsible for construction means and methods , nor does the cm guarantee construction-cost , time , or quality . atrisk cm : the actual-construction work is performed by trade-contractors under contract to the cm , who then becomes responsible to the owner for construction means and methods and delivery of the completed facility within the owner 's scope of work for cost , time , and quality . under this approach , the owner typically retains responsibility for managing all preconstruction a/e services , and therefore must address all interface-issues between service providers . the designbuild-contract-approach represents a much larger step toward outsourcing of traditional-owner-functions than occurs with the abovedescribed cm contract . under this approach , an owner prepares a project-scope-definition and then engages a single entity that will provide all services necessary to complete the design and construct the facility . generally , the scope-definition-package represents a design that is between 15 and 35 percent complete , although variations may begin much earlier , often with a performance-specification , or much later with perhaps a 65 percent design package . project-success under this approach is primarily-dependent on the owner 's ability to produce a comprehensive , welldefined , and unambiguous-scope of work upon which all subsequent-designbuild activity will be based . once the designbuild-contract has been awarded , changes to owner-requirements will generally incur heavy penalties to the project-cost and schedule . the owner is therefore well advised to ensure that preparation of the project-scope-definition package accurately and clearly expresses expectations for project-performance , quality , cost , and schedule . use of the designbuild-approach for project-delivery is growing dramatically in both public and private-organizations ; navfac , gsa , and usps have become particularly strong-proponents of this approach , but not without controversy . the program-management contract-method represents the ultimate step in outsourcing of the owner 's project-management-functions . the program-manager ( pm ) is engaged by the owner to exercise oversight of the entire-facility delivery process for a multitude of projects . similar to the construction-management-approach , the pm can serve in either an `` agency pm '' or `` atrisk '' capacity . program-management contract approach owner as a `` smart-buyer '' american-business has regained its competitive-edge by reengineering its business-practices to improve their effectiveness and , in the process , downsize their inhouse-staff . however , competitive-pressures caused many organizations to approach staff downsizing without adequate-planning . mistakes were made : reductions were insufficient , or too extensive , or made in the wrong-area . the loss of technical-competence through downsizing was sufficiently-pervasive that ffc , in conjunction with tbr and the navfac , conducted the `` government/industry forum on capital facilities and core-competencies '' in march 1998 . a fundamental finding of this forum was that owner-facilities-engineering organizations need to identify and retain core-competencies-the essential technical and managerial-skills that can not be outsourced without serious-risk to an organization 's ability to conceive and acquire necessary-facilities . the forum-participants recognized the advisability of the owner performing as a `` smart-buyer '' of outsourced-services . a smart-buyer is one who retains an inhouse-staff capable of • understanding the organization 's business or mission , its requirements , its customer-needs , and who can translate those needs and requirements into corporate-direction or mission ; • accurately defining the technical-services to be contracted ; • evaluating the quality , performance-effectiveness , and value of technical-work performed by contractors ; and • managing the interface between technical-service contractors and the owner 's lineofbusiness-managers who will ultimately benefit from services provided . these functions are intrinsic to the entire-facility-acquisition process and underscore the need for the owner 's inhouse-staff to be intimately involved in these aspects of the process , particularly the leadership-role . it should be intuitive that poor-planning and design-practices result in cost-implications of facility-acquisition-practices increased tpc . these cost-growth-drivers include • construction-change-orders required to correct errors and omissions in the design-documents ; • ownerdriven construction-change-orders required to incorporate desirable-features overlooked during design ; • inefficient-construction resulting from a failure to incorporate constructionenhancing-features during design ; • rework resulting from unclear-construction documents ; • standby-costs incurred while construction is either stopped or slowed to incorporate changes ; • litigation ; • delayed completion of the facility ( i.e. , lost-business revenue , staff-standby , nonproductive capital investment costs ) ; and • a poorly performing-facility . numerous-research-reports have been published characterizing cost-growth resulting from poor-planning and design-practices . the following are a few of the key-statistics contained in documents abstracted by ffc : 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 6

tpc ( in addition to design-costs discussed above , includes planning , development , and project-management-costs ) . • project rework-costs average 12.4 percent of tpc . eighty percent of this rework results from errors and omissions in the design-documents . the remaining 20-percent-results from poor construction-practices . • fifty percent of construction-change-orders result from errors in the design-documents directly related to improper-interfaces between design-disciplines ( civil , structural , architectural , electrical , and mechanical ) . these change-order costs contribute anywhere from 0.8 to 3.4 percent of tpc . • comprehensive-review of project-document-development during the design-phase of acquisition should cost from 0.2 to 0.5 percent of tpc . properly done ( i.e. , using best-practices discussed later in this study ) , such activity should drive down the cost of construction-change-orders by an average of 3 percent of tpc . • to evaluate the value of thorough-concept-definition a ciiled-review of 62 projects compared final tpc against the estimated tpc at time of project-approval for construction . the 21 projects with the highest degree of

conducted by redichek associates , an a/e firm specializing in outsourced-design-review , indicates that the single biggest source of construction-change-orders ( approximately 50 percent ) is errors

discipline interface design-review is approximately 0.1 percent of tpc , with a resultant-reduction of rework-cost ranging from 0.8 to 3.4 percent of tpc . the estimated-payback-ratio here ranges from

conclusions interface design-review-activity . the implication of these statistics is that opportunity exists to significantly reduce tpc by conducting an effective-design-review process . the potential-savings-range from a minimum of 3 percent to as much as 20 percent , and even higher when indirect-savings are taken into account . intuitively , good design-review-practices result in the preparation of more comprehensive and accurate-construction documents , which in turn result in lower project-construction-costs . areas of savings include less rework on the part of the construction-contractor , fewer change-orders for correction of design-errors or omissions , and the cost of belatedly adding-project-upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original-design . by reducing-changes that are required during the construction-phase , good design-review-practices also generate significant indirect-cost-savings by avoiding-costs associated with loss of productivity during constructiondelayed-facility-startup , and litigation . during the 1980s and 1990s , a number of business-practice-studies were conducted by construction-trade-associations , professional-societies , and academic-groups to better understand which practices produced better results in terms of facility-performance , quality , cost , and schedule . these studies concluded that quality design yields buildings that perform well throughout their service lives.11 quality design resulted when all interested parties ( owner , user , a/e , construction-contractor , and specialty-consultants ) in the facility-acquisition-process worked together in an intense , collaborative , complex , and multiphased-process beginning with conceptual-planning and concluding after the startup-phase . these business-practice-studies also found that decisions made during the conceptual-planning-phase will establish initial constraints limiting future design flexibility . these early decisions thus have a disproportionately greater influence on a facility 's ultimate-performance , quality , cost , and schedule than decisions made later in the process . the conceptual-planning-phase should therefore be the phase when the review of designs is most intense , with the primary-focus upon ensuring the appropriateness , accuracy , and thoroughness of the owner 's expectations regarding facility-performance , quality , cost , and schedule . this will be especially-true when using the designbuild and program-management contract-methods when 11 improving the design quality of federal buildings , nrc , committee on improving the design quality of federal buildings , building research board ( washington , d.c. : national academy press , 1989 ) . page 17 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews the owner 's involvement in design-reviews declines after the conceptual-planning-phase . if design-review-activity during the conceptual-planning-phase has resulted in a clear-scope of work regarding the owner's expectations , design-reviews during the design-phase are greatly simplified . those parties involved should focus upon ensuring that the evolving-facility-design incorporates high standards of professional-engineering-practice , with regard to architectural , civil , structural , electrical , and mechanical-systems and their interfaces . formal-reviews may be scheduled periodically during the design-phase , at approximately the 35 , 60 , 90 , and/or 100 percent design-completion-milestones ( although these milestones may vary significantly depending on the individual-project 's size and complexity ) . such structured-formality helps ensure the widest possible-participation of interested parties during the review , including-specialists and consultants who bring expertise in such areas as value-engineering , constructability , biddability,12 operability , maintainability , and environmental-compliance . during the procurement-phase , the review of designs can continue to contribute to overall-project-success by monitoring-progress made in ordering the various-items of longleadtime-equipment . it is not unusual for suppliers to detect errors in the ordering specifications , or to make substitution-recommendations for either greater economy or performance-enhancement . the review-team should evaluate the impact of these changes on facility-performance , quality , cost , and schedule . it is almost-inevitable during the construction-phase that scope of work-changes by the owner , errors and omissions in the plans , unknown or changed-site-conditions , and creative-initiatives on the part of construction-staff will result in recommended changes to the facility-design . design-reviews in this phase should focus on assessing the impact and advisability of changes on facility-performance , quality , cost , and schedule . design-reviews should continue into the startup-phase . at this juncture , it is important to document the results achieved by conducting what is commonly referred to as a postoccupancy-evaluation , whose purpose is to record lessons learned for future-reference . facility-performance , quality , cost , and schedule actually achieved should be objectively measured and compared with the owner 's original-expectations . lessons learned during in biddability-reviews , procurement-specialists look for conflicts , errors , omissions , and lack of clarity in the construction-documents that could create confusion on the part of prospective-equipment-suppliers or construction-contractors . page 18 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews the five facility-acquisition-phases concerning-design-strengths and weaknesses should be recorded for use in improving-future similar-project-activities . and perhaps most important , the facility-users ' subjective-satisfaction with both the acquisition-process as well as the completed facility should be noted . based on industry-research by cii , nrc , ffc , and similar-organizations , interviews conducted for this study , and the author 's experience , it can be concluded that an effective-design-review process will be structured to address all of the topics included in table i.1 . topic key question to be addressed owner-satisfaction does the constructed facility meet the owner 's expectations as originally defined by the project-scope-definition or statement of work ( i.e. , performance-characteristics , architectural-statement , level of quality , cost , schedule , and any relevant ownerpublished-standards and/or policies ) ? sound professional-practice is the approach taken in each of the specialty-areas ( architectural , civil , mechanical , and electrical ) commensurate with professional-standards ? code-compliance does the design comply with all applicable codes , such as fire-protection , life-safety , and access ? architectural-statement is the overall-presentation representative of established architectural-standards ? value-engineering are there any less expensive-methods or materials that could be used in the design without impacting project-quality or performance ( or lifecycle-costs ) ? biddability are the construction-documents sufficiently-clear and comprehensive so construction-contractors will have no difficulty developing an accurate-bid with minimal-allowance for contingency ? constructability does the design impose any unnecessarily difficult or impossible-demands on the construction-contractor ? operability does design of the facility-operating-systems ensure ease and efficiency of operation during the facility 's useful lifetime ? maintainability does the facility-design allow for easy and costeffective-maintenance and repair over the useful-life of the facility ? lifecycle engineering does the design represent the most effective-balance of cost to construct , cost to start up , cost to operate and maintain , and ( perhaps most important ) the user 's cost to perform the intended function for which the facility is being acquired over the useful-life of the facility ? postoccupancy-evaluation based on a review of the construction , startup , and ongoing-functioning of the facility , could any unexpected-difficulty have been avoided by a different-design approach ? source : federal-facilities council technical report # 139 . federal-facilities comprise a portfolio of significant , durable-assets that have been acquired to support specific-functions and missions and the practices in federal general-conduct of the government 's business . it is estimated that the agencies government spends about $ 20 billion per year for new facilities and major-renovations of existing-facilities . even a relatively-small agency such as ihs is a major-player , with over $ 265 million of construction-activity in planning , design , or construction as of 1999 . at the other end of the spectrum are the truly capitalintensive-agencies , such as the department of the navy with a $ 2.5 billion annual-construction budget . as missions , priorities , and situations change , agencies may experience wide-fluctuations in the scope and budget for their facility-acquisition-programs . for example , a recent-program to upgrade federal-courthouses around the country has added billions of dollars to gsa 's construction-activity . dos is facing a similar situation . following the 1998 bombings of embassies in africa , legislation requiring rapid and extensive-upgrade of embassy security-features-worldwide was enacted which could require several billion dollars to execute . given the size of the government's expenditures on facilities , it is important that federal-agencies have effective-design-review processes that result in buildings that perform well throughout their service-lives . like private-sector-corporations , federal-agencies ' facilities engineering-staffs have been considerably downsized in the past 1015 years . a 1987 report of ffc noted that `` due to budget-cuts , agencies have had to reduce the number of project-managers , design reviewers , inspectors , and field-supervisors they employ . '' procurement-specialists trained primarily in contract-negotiation and review rather than design and construction have been playing increasingly greater roles in facilities development.13 the federal-downsizing-trend accelerated after 1991 as a result of a changed global-environment , a shift in focus toward smaller and more costeffective-government , and a number of legislative initiatives . in the nine federal-agencies that responded to the questionnaire associated with this ffc-report , facilities engineering-staffs have been reduced on the order of 20 to 65 percent , with the average at about 50 percent . as a consequence of the loss of technical-staff , particularly-architects and engineers , federal-agencies are increasingly outsourcing-design and constructionrelated-functions . downsizing of federal-facilities engineering-organizations designreviewrelated-trends in nine federal-agencies the ffc 's standing-committee on organizational-performance and metrics developed a twopart-questionnaire focused on design-review-processes and distributed it to ffc sponsor-agencies . part one was sent to senior facilities engineering program-directors at the headquarters-level and focused on agencywide-policy-issues . part two was sent to randomly selected project-managers at the field-activity level and focused on 13 on the responsibilities of architects and engineers and their clients in federal-facilities development , nrc , committee on architectengineer-responsibilities , building research board ( washington , d.c. : national academy press , 1994 ) . page 20 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews how are agency facility-engineering-functions organized to carry out their missions ? what has been the extent of downsizing on agency facility-engineering organizations ? how are agency facilities-engineering-organizations responding to mitigate the impacts of downsizing ? individual-project review issues . the nine federal-agencies that answered the questionnaires were ang , doe , dos , gsa , ihs , nasa , nih , navfac , and va . the ffc-report included a summary and analysis of questionnaires returned by each of these agencies that described the agency's design-review-practices at the time of the study . the following-discussion compares and contrasts the responses contained in the 44 questionnaires that were returned by the 9 federal-agencies listed above . there is no single organizational-model for federal-agency facilities-engineering-organizations . doe 's facilities are governmentowned but contractoroperated . some agencies , like the va , have moved to fieldbased-design-review and a mix of fieldbased and headquartersbased-project-management . others , like nasa , have a centralized-program-policy and oversight-office , with all program and project-management-functions conducted at the field-activity level . the majority of the responding-agencies maintain multiple regional project execution offices . seven of the nine responding-agencies ' facility-engineering organizations experienced significant downsizing between 1994 and 1999 , on the order of 20 to 50-percent-reduction of inhouse-staff positions ( the va 's reduction has been estimated at 65 percent ) . as of august 1999 , only dos and ang have been able to maintain a relatively stable-situation with regard to staff-size . during the early-stages of downsizing , the responding-agencies simply tried to do more with less . however , this adaptation became untenable at a certain-point . agencies then began to reengineer their facility-engineering-processes and practices . intensity of this reengineering varies among the responding-agencies , reflecting the fact that the speed and extent of downsizing has varied greatly from one agency to another . impactreducing-strategies reported by various-agencies include the following : • augmenting inhouse-staffing-voids through personal-service-contracts . personal-service-contracts allow agencies to add contractor-staff to inhouse-staff on a temporary-basis to fill voids in specific-disciplines , or to address unusual-peaks in workload . procurement-policies vary among agencies with regard to allowing-use of personal-services-contracts . • outsourcing functions previously accomplished inhouse . nearly all facility-acquisition-functions except agency-policy development and oversight have been considered for outsourcing by one agency or another . • reducing the intensity of oversight-activities such as design-review and construction-inspection by either contracting such functions to third parties , or by including the functions within the scope of the design and/or construction-primary contracts . • eliminating some activities entirely . one navfac field-office reported that it has eliminated formal-design-reviews on many smaller projects , holding a/es responsible for instituting a selfreview-process . similarly , a gsa region reported that it generally only requires a single formal-progress-review during design . • using project-delivery contracting schemes that shift more responsibility for design and construction-oversight to the contractor , such as designbuild , construction-management , and program-management . indeed , navfac reports that designbuild is now the favored-contracting-strategy and the traditional-designbidbuild strategy has become the least favored . why and how do federal risk management , compliance with user expectations , and reductions of agencies approach the practice change-orders were cited as the primary-reasons for conducting design of design-review ? reviews . the least cited-reason was to maintain inhouse-core competencies . all nine responding-agencies report participation in a design-review-process . significant-differences were noted , however , as follows : • all responding-agencies reported that they participated in design-reviews , although not at every field-office ( a few field-offices of decentralized agency engineering-organizations reported no or minimal design reviews- they rely on a/es to selfreview their work ) . also , the degree to which agencies and their field activities varied the intensity of the design-review-process between simple and complex-projects varied greatly from one agency to another . • design-review functions identified as having the greatest valueadded were scope and budget-compliance , constructability , and compliance with client-design-guides . functions identified as adding the least value were the discipline-reviews-architectural , electrical , mechanical , and structural ( although the responses did not support the idea that these functions could be dropped from the review-process without risk . ) • nearly all responding-agencies reported conducting formal-design-reviews at the 30 and 90 percent project design milestones . only two ( nasa and gsa ) reported conducting formal-reviews routinely earlier than the 30-percent-milestone . • the primary-criteria used to determine the intensity of design-review are project-value , complexity , and the project-delivery method . conversely , these criteria had little-impact on the decision to review with inhouse or outsourced-resources . that decision rested primarily on inhouse-staff availability . • when elements of design-review are outsourced , all responding-agencies still use inhouse-staff to review project-scope and budget-compliance . the most consistently outsourced-elements included constructability , value-engineering , and compliance with building-codes . • nearly all responding-agencies exploit technology-tools to support their design-review-activities , including-computeraided or assisted design-software , internet and intranet-communication links , and computer-software word processing and project-management programs . • fewer than half of the agencies measure-performance of their design-review-processes . how have federal-agencies eight of the nine responding-agencies reported that they have changed changed their approach to their approach to design-reviews since 1994 . the primary-reasons cited for design-review ? change are staff downsizing , changes in contract-methods , and business-process reengineering . the most frequently reported changes included • consolidation of agency-design-guides and standards for simplification , • increased outsourcing of either parts or all of the design-review-activity , • exploitation of technology to assist the process , and • reduced frequency of formal-design-reviews . several-questions related to outsourcing of design-review functions . opinions and experience on this issue were varied , and no conclusions could be reached from the data provided . the following were typical-comments : • '' outsourcing results in a loss of core-design-capability . this in turn-results in a lack of ability to be a smart-buyer . at some point , we would n't even have enough-expertise to hire a contractor to conduct design-reviews . '' • '' outsourcing poses no risk , as long as the contractors are liable for performance . '' • '' outsourcing poses a very significant-risk , particularly on renovation-type-work . and it is very difficult to have technically competent-contractors in specialty-areas . '' • '' outsourcing is our present way of doing business , and we have experienced little-risk . '' looking to the future , about onethird of the responding-agencies reported that they are considering further outsourcing of design-review functions . during the course of interviews and an extensive-literature search , a interesting-initiatives number of innovative-practices were noted that may have broader implications . these practices are discussed below . partnering and teambuilding although this practice is achieving widespread-recognition , some training-programs have proven more effective than others . usace and cii have both been recognized for their particular-programs , and both offer formal-training . inhouse-training programs agencies have developed inhouse-training programs specializing in program and project-management practices for federal-agencies . among the oldest are schools run by usace and navfac . more recently , nasa has developed two 1week short courses of facility-engineering management-practices . review comment usace 's latest software-program used for documenting , collecting , documentation distributing , and achieving-design review comments is called dr cheks . it runs on a desktop-computer and uses the internet for communication among design-review-participants . perhaps most important , it has features to aid-followup of actions taken in response to review comments , which is a particularly troublesome-area . project-management center of gsa recently established the gsa project-management center of expertise expertise . the center has been staffed by gsa 's most senior and competent-project-managers to serve two functions : • actively manage all of gsa 's uniquely-large , complex , or highvisibility-projects , regardless of location . • provide mentoring , counseling , and training-services in the area of project-management in support of all of gsa 's regional-offices . international-standards some large a/e firms have secured iso 9000 certification as a quality organization ( iso ) 9000 control activity . among federal-agencies , several usace 's district-offices certification have received iso 9000 certification for their design and construction programs . other agencies , including nasa and nih are working toward iso 9000 certification for their facility-engineering activities.14 it should be noted that iso 9000 does not guarantee a quality-product . rather , it guarantees that the process that produces the product ( good or bad ) has been carefully structured , documented , and measured . organizations have 14 subsequent to the issuance of the ffc-report , nasa received iso 9000 certification for its headquarters-office and each of its centers . also , nih received-certification for the design and construction-branch of its division of engineering services . page 24 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews conceptual or advance-planning design-review lessons learned a/e historical performance database nih contractor-performance system found that the process of securing iso 9000 registration has been a valuable-experience in understanding just what they do and how they go about it . most projects that fail to meet their planned-objectives do so because of faulty or inadequate-predesign-development . cii has recently developed a comprehensive preproject-planning approach that allows organizations to measure whether they have adequately addressed all predesign-requirements . cii also has developed a training module intended to assist organizations in adopting this recommended approach to preproject-planning . problems identified in the design-review-process can become a powerful-tool to improve performance . va uses a method of documenting and publicizing such lessons learned in an innovative-program called procats . its purpose is to identify recurring problems that result in change-orders , claims , and delays and then to take positive-steps to avoid such problems in the future . the system is the first of its kind in the federal government and was a 1996 winner of the vice-president 's hammer award . usace has , for many years , maintained a database containing historical-evaluations of a/e performance on past-projects . this database , the acass , can be queried by any federal-agency interested in a particular a/e 's past-performance . nih has developed a multiple-agency , shared-file-system that allows all authorized users to have access to the completed contractor-performance-evaluations of all subscribing-agencies via the internet . a separate-module for each subscribing-agency is developed with a unique url , allowing each agency-control of agency data and access-authority . planned future-enhancements include automated construction and a/e forms , electronic-storage of contractors ' rebuttal and comments , electronic and encrypted transmittal of evaluations to contractor , and ad hoc reporting . during the course of the study , a literature-search was conducted , industry experts and practitioners were consulted , and federal-agencies were valueadded of design surveyed . the findings of this report as they relate to the original-questions posed about the valueadded of design-review-processes and the role of facilities-owners are addressed in this segment . design-reviews are an essential-component of the facility-acquisition what is the valueadded of process . an effective-design-review process helps to unify and align all design-review-processes ? interested parties to a common objective and integrate their knowledge , page 25 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews experience , and skills throughout all phases of the facility-acquisition-process ( conceptual-planning , design , procurement , construction , and startup ) . in the end , effective-review of designs maximizes the probability that a business-requirement will be successfully supported by a facility that was conceived , designed , constructed , and placed into operation efficiently and effectively . effective-design-review practices result in the preparation of more comprehensive and accurate-design and construction-documents , which in turn result in lower project-construction-costs . areas of savings include less rework on the part of the construction-contractor , fewer change-orders to the owner for correction of design-errors or omissions , and the cost of belatedly adding-project-upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original-design . by reducing-changes required during the construction-phase , effective-design-review practices also generate significant indirect-cost-savings by avoiding-costs associated with loss of productivity during constructiondelayed-facility-startup , and litigation . the nine federal-agencies that responded to ffc 's questionnaire indicated that they currently measure the valueadded of design-review-processes primarily from a broad-context : their insight is both subjective ( is the user reasonably-happy with the completed facility ? ) as well as objective ( how close did the completed facility come to the original-cost and schedule-objectives ? ) . sufficient-industry-research has been conducted in recent years to identify metrics that can be used to measure both the efficiency and the effectiveness of each phase of the facility-acquisition-process and compare the results to established-benchmarks . the extent to which individual federal-agencies currently take such measurements and analyze results varies widely . howdo ( andhow can ) federal-agencies measure the valueadded ? what is the role of inhouse-staff , and what value do they addtodesignreview-processes ? within most federal-agencies , acquiring-facilities is a means to support the agency 's mission rather than the mission itself . the agency 's inhouse-facility engineering-staff exist to support the agency 's mission . first and foremost , the inhouse-staff should be able to identify facility-requirements in the context of their impact on the agency 's mission-success and , in so doing , to act as a smart-buyer . the staff should be capable of leading a strategic-planning-process involving-representatives of the agency 's facility user-community where give and take decisions are made balancing the facility 's ultimate-performance , cost , and schedule . during the tactical facility-acquisition phase , inhouse-facility engineering-staff should be capable of providing the overall process-leadership , ensuring that all activities proceed in the best interest of the owner . what functions are being ( and should be ) contracted to outside-consultants ? toward this end , the owner 's interests are best served if the inhouse-staff can also perform in the role of a `` smart-buyer '' of the necessary technical-services . a smart-buyer is one who retains the requisite technical-knowledge to accurately define the technical-services needed , recognizes value during the acquisition of such technical-services , and can evaluate the quality of services ultimately provided . individual and often uncontrollable-circumstances have resulted in nearly all facility-engineering-functions , from conceptual-planning to project-startup , being contracted to outside-consultants at one time or another . today 's general-practice among federal-agencies is to outsource design-development and , to a lesser extent , certain specialized technical-review-functions , such as shop drawing-reviews , value-engineering , and constructability . as long as sufficient-skills are retained inhouse to meet the smart-buyer-approach discussed above , there does not appear to be any greater risk from contracting out a broader range of design-review functions , including such services as construction-document discipline-reviews and code-compliance-checks , so long as such functions are widely-available from a competitive-commercial marketplace . the exception occurs when complex-projects include unique and specialized features of high mission-relevance and limited-skill-availability in the commercial-marketplace ( examples would include nasa wind-tunnels , va medical-research-facilities , and highsecurity military-facilities ) . agencies are well advised to retain such unique specialized skills inhouse as core-competencies , with design-review a primary-inhouse-responsibility . industryrelated-research and the author 's interviews with public and what skills and resources private-sector-practitioners suggest that agencies should retain the do federal-agencies need capabilities inhouse to to provide effective-oversightofdesignreview • define facility-requirements in relation to the agency 's mission , assess facilityrelated-mission-impacts , and conduct facilityrelated strategic processes ? planning-activities ; • lead and conduct teaming-activities involving participants from various interested parties ( owner , user , a/e , construction-contractor , specialty-consultants , etc . ) ; • develop , implement , and maintain overall-policy and direction of the agency 's facility-engineering-function ; and • perform as a smart-buyer of outsourced technical-services . the risks and liabilities will vary depending on whether an agency what risks and liabilities maintains the inhouse-capabilities to perform the design-reviewrelated do federal-agencies face functions listed above . if an agency does not retain such inhouse in outsourcing most or all resources and capabilities , agencies risk the following consequences : of their design-review • consultant-access to agency-decision-makers may be limited , resulting in functions ? difficulty understanding the owner 's project-performance expectations . • project-schedule may be compromised at key-decision-points due to lack of owner-insight . • a design-review-process with little or no owner participation may become ineffective without the owner being aware of the developing-process-deterioration . an owner with little or no participation in design-reviews is less likely to become aware of any breakdowns in the process ; the owner mayfind out toolate toremedy the problem or tosave the project-schedule , and this may result in cost-overruns . • consultants may find it difficult to communicate with owner-staff regarding technical-issues and problem solving . in the case of unique or unusual-facilities , consultants may have limited-access to unique-skills , potentially resulting in naïve and inappropriate technical-solutions . how can new and emerging-technologies be integrated into design-review-processes ? the ongoing-revolution in information technology and communications offers unlimited-opportunities to improve design-review-processes . examples range from relatively-simple practices , such as effective-use of audio and video-teleconferencing to improve meeting-flexibility , to emerging-technologies using holographic-projection-techniques to create threeand fourdimensional-models of project-designs in order to visualize the impact of proposed-changes . the internet and computeraided-design and drafting can be used for fast , comprehensive , paperless communication between reviewers , managers , and a/es . benchmarking offers one tool to identify which technologies offer the most return for the investment made . agencies can identify similar-organizations that have successfully incorporated desirable-technologies and adopt those practices that offer significant-improvements in process , cost-savings , time , or resources . agencies can also consider joining any of the many trade and professional-organizations that assist their membership in identifying and implementing appropriate-technologybased-practices . it is important to recognize that some of the technology-practices will cause major-changes to established-routines , require new equipment and software , and require mastering new sets of skills . effective-design-review processes require work , some of it obvious and some of it quite-subtle . the following-list of 18 best-practices relies heavily on research conducted by cii , tbr , nrc , ffc , and similar-organizations . the best-practices are organized into five categories related to the role of the owner , teamwork and collaboration , advance-planning , process , and benchmarking . 1 . be a smart-buyer . facility-acquisition-processes ( including review of role of the owner designs ) work best when the owner has sufficient-inhouse expertise to qualify as a smart-buyer . a smart-buyer is one who retains an inhouse-staff that understands the organization's mission , its requirements , and its customer-needs and who can translate those needs and requirements into a corporate or strategic-direction . a smart-buyer also retains an inhouse-staff that includes technical-experts who can articulate the nature of technical-services being bought , recognize good-value during the negotiation of such services , and evaluate the quality of the services as they are provided . 2 . develop a scope of work that clearly and accurately defines the owner 's expectations regarding-facility-cost , schedule , performance , and quality . the owner 's standards , more than those of any other entity involved in the acquisition-process , will set the tone for all aspects of design-review-activity . the owner 's scope of work should be used as the yardstick against which to measure-performance . 3 . avoid the temptation to micromanage design-reviews . a/es are selected based on their experience and expertise ; they should be given wide-latitude to bring that expertise to fruition . 4 . use teambuilding and partnering-techniques to build good working teamwork and collaboration and communicative-relationships among the participants , as well as to align all participants toward common-objectives and expectations . 5 . ensure that all interested parties participate in design-reviews from the planning and design-phases , so that all perspectives are represented as the design-evolves . broad participation creates early-project-endorsement or `` buyin , '' reducing the potential of later-disagreement or need for changes . at a minimum , involve representatives of the owner , the user , the a/e , construction-management-staff , maintenance and operations staff , and special-staff such as procurement , safety , and advance-planning fire-protection . where possible and appropriate , include the construction-contractor , permitting-agency-staff , and independent specialists for value-engineering and independent-review . err on the side of excess-participation-it is costeffective-protection against subsequent unexpected and expensive-fixes and oversights . 6 . use the same a/e throughout the facility-acquisition-process to maximize continuity and allow participants to build and apply their experience-baseline . using the same a/e for conceptual-planning , detailed design , construction-support-engineering services , and startup takes advantage of the a/e 's intimate understanding of both the owner and his project-needs , and supports continuity of personnel involved . 7 . use senior , experienced-personnel who understand the relationship of a facility to meeting the agency 's overall-mission and who can effectively evaluate the evolving-design and guide the review-process . 8 . participants should commit for the duration of the activity to ensure continuity . changing-participants from any of the organizations involved in reviewing the design can disrupt the work-flow and threaten the stability of good teaming relationships . 9 . participate in a design-awards-program in order to recognize and motivate excellence . nothing succeeds like success ! recognition of a job well done gives visibility to a successful process and motivates all of the participants to continually improve . 10 . focus attention on the review of designs during the conceptual-planning and design-phases , where the ability to influence the ultimate-functionality and cost of the project is the greatest . effective-design-review processes start out being very intensive and proactive , with an intensity that declines through the procurement , construction , and startup-phases of the acquisition-process . 11 . do not start the final-stage of design-preparation of the construction-plans and specifications-until the preliminary-engineering has been completed . to do otherwise could significantly slow the overall-design-activity due to frequent-interruption and rework caused by incomplete-project scope definition . 12 . tailor the design-review-approach to project-specifics . project process complexity , cost , mission-criticality , visibility , method of contracting , page 30 gao/ggd00172r study on facility-design reviews benchmarking and schedule are just a few of the variables that can drive aspects of the design-review-approach such as frequency , intensity , and reliance on outsourced-experts and consultants . 13 . keep up the pace to maintain momentum and keep the facility-acquisition-process on schedule . the review of designs at each phase of the process should not impede progress toward a completed facility . a stopstart or prolonged process impacts the acquisition in many ways , perhaps the most critical being the increased potential that organizations will reassign participants . 14 . pay special-attention to the civil , structural , electrical , and mechanical-interfaces . historically , 3050 percent of all construction-change-orders result from interference-fit problems between trades . is the power-supply appropriate to the specified mechanical-equipment ? does the hvac ( heating , ventilating , and air-conditioning ) ducting interfere with structural-members ? 15 . exploit technology . the technological-revolution has provided many tools to enhance design-review-processes , including-computeraided design , threedimensional-modeling , data-collection and distribution-software-programs , and rapid-communications systems , including the internet . 16 . conduct a postoccupancy-evaluation to develop a lessonslearned-document for future-reference . after facility startup , the design-review-team should document objective-results ( how did final-cost and schedule compare to planned ? ) as well as subjective-results ( is the user pleased with facility-performance ? ) . the postoccupancy-evaluation should also relate approaches taken during the various-phases of the facility-acquisition-process with the final-results . 17 . measure-results achieved by design-review-processes in order to assess their level of performance . a process can not be managed if it is not measured . successful-benchmarking requires an organization to identify relevant-performance-characteristics , measure them , and compare results against either established industrial-norms or against similar measured characteristics of other organizations recognized for their excellence . 18 . document both unusually-good and bad-performance for future-reference . even better , find a way to share such information with other organizations and federal-agencies . enclosure ii comments from the director , federal-facilities council see footnote 14 on p. 24 . enclosure iii comments from mr. ralph spillinger , primary-author of the ffc
