boone legal-service for needy may end kix paul monday , december 23 , 2002 boone , ia . -poor and elderly-people may soon go without legal-representation in boone county . boone county legal-aid , which for 31 years has provided legal-services to those who could n't afford them , will close in february if a $ 10,000 grant from prairie meadows racetrack and casino is not awarded . the legal-service is one of the few programs in iowa that offers legal-representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services . `` it is a very sad-situation , but that 's the fact , '' said alan schroeder , city-attorney and supervisor of boone county legal-aid . for the past two years using-money mostly from the city and county , schroeder has upheld the outfit alone , taking on about 60 clients a year , and settling-cases that range from domestic-abuse to bankruptcy . he also has a private-practice . if the legal-service closes , he 's unsure where his clients will go . the city of boone gave schroeder $ 6,300 in july to resolve pending-cases , said kathy berg , boone 's finance-officer . without that , the program might already be closed . `` all governments are having problems with finances , '' boone mayor george maybee said . `` no one else stepped in . the county did n't . the state did n't . '' donovan olson , chairman of the county board of supervisors , said the board quit funding the legal-service in july because it felt the county did n't need it . drake university ended its funding after the 2000-spring-semester `` for a variety of reasons , '' suzanne levitt , the law-professor who oversaw the program , said via e-mail . olson said schroeder must prove prairie meadows is the primary money-source for the board to grant the program any more money . schroeder ran the program without the help of law-students or drake , which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years . olson and the board did not want to be the main-money source . schroeder told them he would apply for grants , but he received none . schroeder may not hear from prairie meadows until march , but he believes he can last until then .
