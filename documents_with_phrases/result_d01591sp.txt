78 text-box 4.2 : government-saving when reducing publicly held federal-debt is not an option 84 text-box 4.3 : individual-development-accounts for low-income-savers 102 abbreviations preface the term `` saving '' is used both when people discuss their own finances and when policymakers and economists discuss `` national-saving . '' for people and for the nation , saving-means forgoing-consumption-today so they can enjoy a better standard of living in the future . national saving-the-portion of a nation 's current-income not consumed-is the sum of saving by households , businesses , and all levels of government . national-saving represents resources available for investment to replace old factories and equipment and to buy more and better capital-goods . higher saving and investment in a nation 's capital-stock contribute to increased productivity and stronger economic growth over the long term . saving-today-increases a nation 's capacity to produce goods and services in the future and , therefore , helps to increase the standard of living for future-generations . since the 1970s , combined saving by households and business has declined . for much of that time , the federal government did not contribute to saving ; instead it was a borrower , its deficits absorbing a share of the saving-pool available for investment . for the nation as a whole , saving has rebounded somewhat from its low point in the early-1990s but remains relatively-low by u.s. historical-standards . in fiscal year 1998 , the federal government began to contribute to the pool of saving by running its first surplus since 1969 . federal-budget-surpluses now are projected for at least the next decade . but even with the advent of federal government-saving in the late 1990s , national-saving available for new investment remains relatively-low , in large part because personal-saving has dramatically declined . the u.s. has been able to invest more than it saves by borrowing from abroad , but economists question whether this is a viable-strategy for the long term . personal-saving plays a dual-role , ensuring both individuals' retirement-security and the nation 's economic-security . while social-security provides a foundation for retirement-income , saving through pensions and by individuals on their own behalf contribute substantially to retirement-income . even as more people are accumulating-balances through employer-sponsored 401 ( k ) saving-plans and individual-retirement-accounts , personal-saving-which does not reflect gains on existing-assets-has declined . the personal-saving-rate has plunged , with american-households-spending virtually all of their current-income . although aggregate-household wealth has risen in part as a result of the stock-market-boom over the 1990s , many individual-households have accumulated little , if any , wealth . america faces a demographic tidal-wave that poses significant-challenges for individuals ' retirement-security and our economy as a whole . more people are living longer in retirement , and there will be relatively fewer workers supporting each retiree in the future . without meaningful-reform , the social-security and medicare programs face long-term-financing-problems . although public-attention usually focuses on the dates by which the trust-funds are projected to become insolvent , the effects associated with financing-cash-deficits for these programs will be felt sooner as the baby-boom-generation begins to retire . as the population-ages , spending for social-security and federal-health-programs will leave increasingly less room for spending on other national-priorities . increasing national-saving is an important way to bolster retirement-security for current-workers and to allow future-workers to more easily bear the costs of financing federal-retirement and health-programs while maintaining their standard of living . as we have reported in the past , the surest way for the federal-government-to affect national-saving is through federal fiscal-policy , particularly in what it chooses to do with the budget-surpluses projected over the next decade . policymakers appear to have agreed to save the social-security surpluses , and the fiscal-policy-debate has centered on what to do with the balance of the anticipated-surpluses . to the extent that they are used to reduce federal-debt held by the public , surpluses represent an opportunity to increase national-saving . in addition , how surpluses are used has long-term-implications for future economic growth . policy debates surrounding social-security and medicare reform also have implications for all levels of saving-government , personal , and , ultimately , national . this report is designed to present information about national saving-as measured in the national-income and product accounts-and its implications for economic growth and retirement-security in a concise and easily understandable-manner . in general , this report is based on widely accepted economic-principles , and we identify those areas where many economists do not agree . although many excellent-studies and books have been written on national-saving and long-term economic growth , these discussions tend to be complex and technical . also , most discussion of the decline in personal-saving focuses on the adequacy of individuals ' retirement-saving rather than on the significance of personal-saving for the economy as a whole . for example , one point that is sometimes overlooked is that low personal-saving has consequences for u.s. reliance on foreign-borrowing , long-term economic growth , and standards of living for future-generations . this report addresses the following-questions : ( 1 ) what is personal-saving , how is it related to national-saving , and what are the implications of low personal-saving for americans ' retirement-security ? ( 2 ) what is national-saving and how does current-saving in the united states compare to historical-trends and saving in other countries ? ( 3 ) how does national-saving affect the economy and how would higher saving affect the longterm-outlook ? ( 4 ) how does federal fiscal-policy affect national-saving , what federal-policies have been aimed at increasing private-saving , and how would social-security and medicare reform affect national-saving ? and , ( 5 ) what are key-issues in evaluating national-saving ? for a quick-overview of the topics discussed in this report , see the summary-section . for easy-access to definitions of key-terms , we include a glossary at the end of this report . terms contained in the glossary appear in bold-type in the text the first time they are used in the major-sections . for readers who are interested in more detailed-information on the topics covered here , we also include a bibliography . this report was prepared under the direction of paul l. posner , managing director of federal-budget analysis , and susan j. irving , director of federal-budget analysis , who may be reached at ( 202 ) 512-9573 if there are any questions . paul l. posner susan j. irving managing director federal-budget analysis strategic issues director federal-budget analysis strategic issues summary of major-sections personal-saving and retirement-security the personal-saving rate-as measured in the national-income and product-accounts ( nipa ) -reflects how much-households in aggregate are saving from their current disposable-income . in evaluating personal-saving , it is important to distinguish between saving as a way for an individual-household to finance-future-consumption and saving as a way to finance the nation 's capital-formation . strange as it may seem to the typical-household , capital gains on its existing-assets do not contribute to saving as measured in nipa . that is because capital gains reflect a revaluation of the nation's existing-capital-stock and do not provide resources for financing-investment that adds to the capital-stock . whereas employer-contributions to pension funds as well as pension funds ' interest and dividend-income are part of personal-income and contribute to personal-saving , increases in the market value of assets held by pension funds , for example , are not counted as personal-income and saving . although an individual-household can tap its wealth by selling-assets to finance-consumption or accumulate other assets , the sale of an existing-asset merely transfers ownership ; it does not generate new economic-output . the personal-saving-rate has largely declined since the 1980s , plummeting in recent years to levels not seen since the great depression , as shown in figure s.1 . a low personal-saving-rate raises questions about whether households have adequate-resources to sustain their rate of spending . a negative saving-rate means that , in aggregate , households are spending more than their current-income by drawing down past saving , selling existing-assets , or borrowing . 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 source : bureau of economic-analysis , department of commerce . economists use several-theories to explain what motivates people to save . despite a great deal of study , economists have found no single-reason that convincingly explains the decline in the personal-saving-rate . one possible-explanation is that surging household-wealth in recent years contributed to the virtual-disappearance of personal-saving . since the mid 1990s , aggregate-household wealth has swelled relative to disposable personal-income , largely-due to increases in the market value of households' existing-assets ( see figure 1.2 ) . yet , despite the stock-market-boom of the 1990s , many households have accumulated little , if any , wealth ( see figure 1.3 ) , and half of american-households did not own stocks as of 1998 . while social-security provides a foundation for retirement-income , social-security-benefits replace only about 40 percent of pre-retirement-income for the average-worker . as a result , social-security-benefits must be supplemented by private-pensions , accumulated assets , or other resources in order for individuals to maintain a reasonable-standard of living in retirement compared to their final working-years . pensions , income from accumulated assets , and earnings from continued-employment largely determine which households will have the highest retirement-income ( see figures 1.4 and 1.5 ) . pensions are not a universal-source of retirement-income , and more than half of those working in 1998 lacked a pension-plan . while most families say they recognize the need to save for retirement , national-saving overview fewer than half of those surveyed in early 2001 had tried to calculate how much they need to save . over the next 75 years , the elderly-population will nearly-double as a share of the total u.s. population ( see figure 1.6 ) . as more people live longer , there will be relatively fewer workers supporting each retiree unless retirement-patterns change . while today there are 3.4 workers for each social-security beneficiary , by 2030 , there will be only about 2 workers paying-taxes to support each beneficiary ( see figure 1.7 ) . both social-security and medicare face long-term-financing-problems , and the social-security and medicare 's hospital-insurance trust-funds eventually will be exhausted as the baby-boomers draw their benefits ( see figures 1.8 and 1.9 ) . absent reform , social-security and medicare costs would constitute a substantial-drain on the earnings of future-workers ( see figure 1.10 ) . anticipating potential-benefit-cuts , people could choose to save more now , work longer to delay retirement , or experience a lower standard of living in retirement . with an aging-population and a slowly growing-workforce , saving more today and increasing the nation 's future economic-capacity is critical to ensuring-retirement-security in the 21st century . in the nipa , national-saving is the sum of saving by households , businesses , and all levels of government . gross national-saving-which reflects resources available both to replace old , worn out capital-goods and to expand the capital-stock-has rebounded as a share of gross domestic product ( gdp ) from its low in the 1990s but remains below the level of the 1960s ( see figure 2.1 ) . depreciation as a share of gdp has increased slightly over the past 4 decades , and net national-saving-which excludes depreciation-remains well below the 1960s average , as shown in figure s.2 . through much of the 1980s and early-1990s , federal-deficits absorbed funds saved by households and businesses and reduced overall national-saving available to finance private-investment ( see figure 2.2 ) . even as federal-surpluses have contributed to national-saving in recent years , personal-saving has steadily declined as a share of gdp , and personal-dissaving in 2000 absorbed-resources that otherwise would have been available for investment . although gross national-saving in 2000 was low by u.s. historical-standards , u.s. gross national-saving has generally been lower than other major industrialized-countries over the past 4 decades ( see figure 2.3 ) . national-saving and the economy 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 source : gao analysis of nipa data from the bureau of economic-analysis , department of commerce . national-saving represents resources available for investment in the nation 's stock of capital-goods , such as plant , equipment , and housing . the nation 's human-capital and knowledge-forms of intangible-capital-are not part of the nipa-definitions of saving and investment . also , nipa focuses on the incomes arising from current-production of goods and services and , thus , does not count revaluation of existing-assets in national-saving . changes in the market value of existing tangible and financial-assets , such as land and stocks , reflect expectations about the productive-potential of the underlying-capital , but fluctuations in asset-values may not represent real , permanent-changes in the nation's productive-capacity . national-saving together with borrowing from abroad provides the resources for investment that can boost productivity and lead to higher economic growth and future-living-standards ( see figure 3.1 ) . investment in new capital is an important way to raise the productivity of the slowly growing-workforce as the population-ages . greater economic growth from saving more now would make it easier for future-workers to achieve a rising-standard of living for themselves while also paying for the government 's commitments to the elderly . economic growth also depends on education to enhance the knowledge and skills of the nation 's work national-saving and the government force-the-nation 's human-capital-as well as research and development to spur technological-advances . even though national-saving remains relatively-low by u.s. historical-standards , economic growth in recent years has been high because more and better investments were made . each dollar saved bought more investment-goods , and a greater share of saving was invested in highly-productive information technology . also , the united states was able to invest more than it saved by borrowing from abroad ( see figure 3.2 ) . persistent u.s. current-account-deficits have translated into a rising-level of indebtedness to other countries , i.e. , net u.s. holdings of foreign-assets ( see figure 3.3 ) . many other nations currently financing-investment in the united states also will face aging-populations and declining national-saving , so relying on foreign-savers to finance a large-share of u.s. domestic-investment is not a viable-strategy for the long run . current-saving and investment-decisions have profound-implications for the nation 's level of well-being in the future . our simulations using a longterm economic-growth-model show that , even assuming the united states could maintain national-saving constant at its 2000 share of gdp , future-incomes would fall short of the rise in living-standards enjoyed by prior-generations whose income generally doubled every 35 years ( see figures 3.4 and 3.5 ) . saving more would improve the nation 's long-term economic outlook , but this requires consuming less now . federal fiscal-policy affects the amount of federal government-saving and this in turn directly affects national-saving . from the 1970s through the mid 1990s , federal-deficits absorbed a large-share of private-saving and reduced the amount of national-saving available for investment ( see figure 4.1 ) . borrowing to finance these deficits added to the federal-debt held by the public . in recent years , federal-surpluses added to national-saving and increased funds available for investment . so far , the federal government has used surplus-funds to reduce its debt held by the public . accumulating nonfederal financial-assets , such as stocks , could be another way that government-saving could translate into resources available for investment , but this idea is controversial . an additional-dollar of government-saving and debt-reduction does not automatically increase national-saving and investment by a dollar because changes in saving by households and businesses will tend to offset some of the change in government-saving . while attention has focused on budget-surpluses projected over the next decade , the federal-budget will increasingly be driven by one certainty-the-population is aging and there will be fewer workers supporting each retiree . in our simulations , saving only the social-security surpluses will not be sufficient to accommodate both the projected growth in social-security and health-entitlements as well as other important national-priorities in the long term ( see figure 4.2 ) . absent program-changes , saving the social-security surpluses-and even the medicare surpluses-is not enough to ensure retirement-security for the aging-population without placing a heavy-burden on future-generations . social-security and health-spending alone eventually would exceed total federal-revenue and squeeze out most or all other spending ( see figure 4.3 ) . even if the entire unified-surplus were saved , our simulations show that the rise in living standards- measured in terms of gdp per capita-would-fall short of the rise enjoyed by prior-generations whose income generally doubled every 35 years ( see figure 4.4 ) . reforming-retirement and health-entitlement programs is critical to putting the federal-budget on a more sustainable-footing for the long term and to freeing up future-resources for other competing-needs . although increasing-government-saving is the most direct way for the federal-government-to increase national-saving , budget-surpluses also could be used to finance federal-investment intended to promote long-term economic growth or to encourage personal-saving . whereas unified-budget-surpluses increase national-saving available for private-investment , increasing federal-spending on national-infrastructure , if properly designed and administered , can be another way to increase the nation 's capital-stock . in addition , federal-spending on education and research and development-while not counting as investment in nipa-can , if properly designed and administered , promote the nation 's long-term-productivity and economic growth . the federal government also has sought to encourage personal-saving-both to enhance households ' financial-security and to boost national-saving . but , developing-policies that have the desired effect is difficult . tax-incentives affect how people save for retirement but do not necessarily increase the overall-level of personal-saving . even with preferential-tax-treatment for employer-sponsored-retirement saving-plans and individual-retirement-accounts , the personal-saving-rate has steadily declined . economists disagree about whether tax-incentives are effective in increasing the overall-level of personal-saving . the net-effect of a tax-incentive on national-saving depends on whether the tax-incentive induces enough-additional saving by households to make up for the lower government-saving resulting from the government 's revenue-loss . in recent years , policymakers have explored using-government matching or creating new individual-accounts to encourage americans to save more . congress found that a leading-obstacle to expanding-retirement saving has been that many americans do not know how to save for retirement , let alone how much . the department of labor maintains an outreach-program to raise public-awareness about the advantages of saving and to help educate workers about how much they need to save for retirement . other federal-agencies also play a role in educating the public about saving . individualized-statements now sent annually by the social-security administration to most workers aged 25 and older provide important-information for personal-retirement planning , but knowing more about social security's financial-status would help-workers to understand how to view their personal-benefit-estimates . restoring social-security to sustainable-solvency and increasing-saving are intertwined national-goals . saving for the nation's retirement-costs is analogous to an individual 's retirement-planning in that the sooner we increase saving , the greater our benefit from compounding-growth . the way in which social-security is reformed will influence both the magnitude and timing of any increase in national-saving . the ultimate-effect of social-security reform on national-saving depends on complex-interactions between government-saving and personal-saving-both through pension funds and by individuals on their own behalf . various-proposals would create new individual-accounts as part of social-security reform or in addition to social-security . the extent to which individual-accounts would affect national-saving depends on how the accounts are funded , how the account-program is structured , and how people adjust their own saving-behavior in response to the new accounts . the medicare program is fiscally-burdensome in its current-form , and medicare spending ( see figure 4.5 ) is expected to drive federal government-dissaving over the long run . given the aging of the u.s. population and the increasing-cost of modern medical-technology , it is inevitable that demands on the medicare program will grow . the current medicare program lacks incentives to control health-care-consumption , and the cost of health-care-decisions is not transparent to consumers . although future medicare costs are expected to consume a growing-share of the federal-budget and the economy , pressure is mounting to expand medicare 's benefit-package to cover prescription drugs , which will add billions to medicare program-costs . in balancing health-care-spending with other societal-priorities , it is important to distinguish between health care wants , which are virtually-unlimited ; needs , which should be defined and addressed ; and overall-affordability , which has a limit . reducing federal medicare spending would improve future-levels of government-saving , but the ultimate-effect on national-saving depends on how the private sector responds to the reductions . key-issues in light of the virtual-disappearance of personal-saving , concerns about u.s. reliance on borrowing from abroad to finance domestic-investment , and the looming fiscal-pressures of an aging-population , federal decisionmakers must consider how much of the anticipated-budget-surpluses to save , spend , or use for tax-reductions . economic growth will help society bear the burden of financing social-security and medicare , but it alone will not solve our long-term fiscal-challenge . to participate in the debate over how to reform social-security and medicare , the public-needs to understand the difficult-choices the nation faces . section 1 personal-saving and retirement-security q1.1 . what is the personal-saving-rate and what does it mean ? a1.1 . the personal-saving-rate is the most widely cited statistic about how much-households save , but most people do not know what the rate-measures or what it means . first , it is necessary to distinguish `` saving '' from `` savings . '' in everyday terms , `` saving '' means spending less than your income and `` savings '' are the assets accumulated over time . to better distinguish between these concepts in this report , the term `` saving '' means the money set aside from current-income for future consumption-i.e. , how much of each period 's income is saved rather than spent . the terms '' assets accumulated '' and `` wealth '' are used for the cumulative-stock of resources built over time-what-people commonly think of as '' savings . '' the personal-saving-rate , as measured in the national-income and product-accounts ( nipa ) ,1 reflects how much american-households are setting aside from current-income . under nipa , personal-saving is what is left over from personal-income after taxes and personal-spending for goods and services . disposable personal-income is the income available for personal-spending and saving after federal , state , and local-taxes as well as social-security and medicare payroll-taxes are paid . the nipa personal-saving-rate is calculated as the ratio of personal-saving to disposable personal-income . to understand what the personal-saving-rate means , it is helpful to understand the nipa-definitions of `` persons , '' personal-income , and personal-spending . for nipa purposes , `` persons '' include not only individuals but also nonprofit-institutions primarily serving individuals , pension funds , and private-trust-funds . nipa personal-income includes wages and salaries ; interest and dividend-income ; rental-income ; 2 proprietors ' income ; government-transfer-payments , such as social-security , veterans , and unemployment-benefits ; and employer-contributions to pension-plans as well as group-health and life-insurance-plans . contributions to traditional-defined-benefit pension-plans and defined contribution-plans-such as 401 ( k ) plans-together with pension 1the national-income and product-accounts ( nipa ) are the comprehensive-set of accounts that show the composition of production and the distribution of incomes earned in production . nipa data reflect production in the united states as well as u.s. transactions with the rest of the world . nipa data are prepared by the bureau of economic-analysis of the department of commerce . for more information , see eugene p. seskin and robert p. parker , `` a guide to the nipa 's , '' survey of current business , vol . 78 , no . 3 ( march 1998 ) , pp . 26-68 . 2nipa treats the net rental-value on owner-occupied-housing as personal-income . funds ' interest and dividend-income represent an important-component of nipa personal-income and saving.3 benefits paid by pension-plans are not a component of nipa personal-income , although pension-benefits represent an important-means for many retirees to finance-consumption ( see q1.8 ) . nipa personal-spending includes , for example , food , clothing , rent , utilities , and medical care ; consumer-interest-payments ; and consumer-durables , such as cars and major appliances.4 strange as it may seem to the average-household , changes in the value of existing-assets , such as stocks , bonds , or real estate , do not contribute to nipa personal-income and saving . that is because capital gains reflect a revaluation of the nation 's existing-capital-stock and do not provide resources for financing-investment that adds to the capital-stock . under the current nipa methodology , realized gains do not count as personal-income , but any taxes paid on such gains reduce disposable personal-income and thus-personal saving . although the nipa personal-saving-rate is the measure most frequently cited by analysts and the media , an alternative macroeconomic-measure of personal-saving is available from the federal reserve 's flow of funds-accounts ( ffa ) .5 whereas nipa-measures saving as what is left over from personal-income after taxes and personal-spending , ffa measures saving as the net-increase in households ' financial and tangible-assets less the net-increase in households ' liabilities . both the nipa and ffa measures count household-purchases of houses as saving . the ffa personal-saving-rate also counts household-purchases of consumer-durables as saving and , thus , is somewhat higher than the nipa personal-saving-rate . both the nipa and ffa macroeconomic-measures focus on saving from the economy 's current-production and do not include changes in the market value of households ' existing-portfolios . in this report , we use the nipa measure of 3a defined-benefit-pension plan generally provides benefits based on a specific-formula linked to the worker 's earnings and tenure . typically , a defined benefit-plan is funded completely by the employer , who bears the investment-risk of such as arrangement . under a defined contribution-plan , a percentage of pay is contributed by the employer to an account for each worker , with the worker bearing the investment-risk . the increasingly-popular 401 ( k ) plans also allow contributions by workers . 4this refers to spending by `` persons '' in nipa and not just by individuals . 5the flow of funds-accounts ( ffa ) measure the acquisition of physical and financial-assets throughout the u.s. economy and the sources of funds used to acquire the assets . for more information , see guide to the flow of funds-accounts , vol . 1 , board of governors of the federal reserve system ( 2000 ) . q1.2 . why measure personal-saving ? personal-saving because it more closely represents the resources available from households for the nation 's capital-formation . for the economy as a whole , the personal-saving-rate provides a measure of how much-households are saving compared to current disposable personal-income . a positive-saving-rate means that american-households in aggregate are saving . a low personal-saving-rate means that households in aggregate are spending virtually all of their current-income . a negative personal-saving-rate means that , in aggregate , american-households are spending more than their current-income-or `` dissaving . '' given that the personal-saving-rate is an aggregate-measure , some individuals might be saving a lot even while others are drawing down past saving , selling existing-assets , or borrowing to finance their current-consumption . a1.2 . for the economy as a whole , personal-saving can be a vital source of the nation 's saving available to finance private and government-investment . nipa personal-saving is widely recognized by economists as the key-measure of the resources that households contribute to national-saving . a low personal-saving-rate-unless offset by relatively higher saving by businesses and/or government or by borrowing from abroad-limits how much the nation can invest and so ultimately limits future economic growth . a low personal-saving-rate can raise questions about whether current-generations are setting aside enough to sustain the nation 's productive-capacity , especially if the other components of national-saving are not correspondingly higher . some analysts are concerned that the demand for household-consumption is in part fueling the u.s. trade-deficit . section 2 discusses the trend and the components of national-saving , and section 3 explains how saving affects long-term economic growth and living-standards . the personal-saving-rate also has implications for americans' ability to sustain their current-rate of spending . personal-spending represents about two-thirds of the u.s. economy . a low personal-saving-rate raises questions about whether americans have adequate-resources to withstand a financial-emergency such as unemployment in the event of an economic downturn . in addition , many policymakers and analysts have questioned whether american-households are saving enough to ensure their retirement-security . having said this , it is important to recognize that macroeconomic-measures such as the nipa personal-saving-rate do not provide a complete-picture of q1.3 . how has the personal-saving-rate changed over time ? the finances of individual-households . a household 's capacity to consume depends on both its current-income and its wealth . one way to measure households ' wealth is net-worth , or the difference between households ' assets and their liabilities.6 the change in households ' net-worth is broader than the nipa or ffa measures of personal-saving and includes both the flow of saving from current-income plus any increase ( or decrease ) in the market value of existing-assets such as houses and stocks . for the economy as a whole , however , the change in households ' net-worth due to revaluation of households ' existing-assets does not represent resources available to invest in the nation 's capital stock.7 a1.3 . figure 1.1 shows the personal-saving rate-expressed as a percentage of disposable personal-income-over the past 4 decades . the personal-saving-rate averaged 8.3 percent over the 1960s and increased to an average of 9.6 percent over the 1970s . within each of those 2 decades , annual-saving-rates were relatively-steady , although they ranged from a low of 7.2 in 1960 to a high of 10.7 percent in 1974 . over the 1980s , the personal-saving-rate was slightly lower than in the 1970s . after peaking at 10.9 percent in 1982 , the rate generally declined over the 1980s , dropping as low as to 7.3 percent in 1987 ; for the decade , the rate averaged 9.1 percent . the personal-saving-rate rebounded from 1987 to 1992 when it reached 8.7 percent . since then , the personal-saving-rate has steadily declined and averaged only 5.9 percent over the 1990s . in the late 1990s , the personal-saving-rate dropped below the postwar low of 4.7 percent in 1947 . in 1999 , the personal-saving-rate plunged to 2.2 percent-an annual rate not seen since the great depression . as shown in figure 1.1 , the personal-saving-rate in 2000 was estimated to be -0.1 percent.8 with the personal-saving-rate around zero or negative , economists have questioned how to interpret the decline ; see question 1.7 . 6households ' aggregate-net-worth is available from the flow of funds-accounts ' balance sheet for the household-sector . 7for further discussion of whether revaluation of existing-assets counts as saving , see questions 1.7 and 2.4 . 8the last time the personal-saving-rate was negative was in 1932 ( -0.8 percent ) and 1933 ( -1.5 percent ) . page 21 gao-01-591sp national-saving q1.4 . why do people save ?

'' in saving for retirement , individuals theoretically take into account not only their expected retirement-age and the number of years they expect to live in retirement but also project their expected income , real-returns on assets accumulated , and inflation over their lifetime . although providing for retirement is a powerful-motive for saving , the life-cycle-model in its simplest form can not fully explain how people decide to save . faced with the difficulty of reconciling the standard-life-cycle-model with available-empirical data , economists have examined other motives that may help explain saving-behavior . while some evidence supports each motive , economists do not have a unified-theory that fully explains how people choose to save.10 in general , the other major-incentives or reasons why people save are categorized as follows : • precautionary-saving motive . this is saving to protect against unexpected-expenses or possible-emergencies , such as unemployment or illness . in particular , individuals who face greater uncertainty about their income and those who are risk-averse may tend to save more for a `` rainy-day . '' precautionary-saving may be over-and-above basic-life-cycle saving for retirement . some people may choose to save enough to maintain a buffer-stock or contingency-reserve during their early working-years and defer retirement-saving until their 40s or 50s.11 • bequest saving-motive . this is saving beyond basic-life-cycle saving for retirement . some people may choose to save more in order to bequeath the accumulated wealth to future-generations . the desire to leave a bequest may explain why the elderly do not fully deplete their wealth and some even continue to save during retirement . to some 10for a comprehensive-review of personal-saving literature , see martin browning and annamaria-lusardi , `` household saving : micro-theories and micro facts , '' journal of

economics , vol . cxii , no . 1 ( 1997 ) , pp . 1-56 . page 23 gao-01-591sp national-saving extent , bequests may be unplanned and thus reflect unspent retirement and precautionary-saving . • '' big-ticket '' saving-motive . this is relatively-short-term saving to accommodate a mismatch between current-income and expenses during the life-cycle . some people save to pay for big-ticket-items such as cars , other consumer-durables , or vacations . some must save in advance because they can not borrow , while others may prefer to save and avoid borrowing . another big-ticket is the down payment to buy a home ; households largely borrow to buy homes and later save by repaying their mortgages . paying for postsecondary-education is a big-ticket above and beyond life-cycle saving for retirement . given that people save for different-purposes , increasing the rate of return on saving does not necessarily motivate people to save more . a higher rate of return has two opposing-effects on personal-saving . on the one hand , a higher rate of return may encourage people to save more because future-spending becomes less costly-relative to spending today-the substitution effect . on the other hand , given a higher rate of return , people need to save less now to finance a given level of future-consumption . this reduced incentive to save as real-rates of return-increase is called the income effect.12 how people react to an increase in the rate of return depends not only on their preferences about spending-today versus spending in the future but also on the real-after-tax-rate of return-that is , the rate expected after taking into account inflation and taxes.13 not everyone behaves like a life-cycle-saver . many people plan over shorter horizons-a few years or even paycheck-to-paycheck . instead of trying to forecast lifetime-income and economic conditions in the distant-future , people may use simple-rules of thumb , such as saving a fixed-share of their income or avoiding debt.14 many people are `` target-savers '' who aim for a fixed-level of wealth or ratio of wealth to income in order to achieve 12textbooks in microeconomics discuss these effects in detail . for a brief-summary of substitution and income-effects , see n. gregory mankiw , macroeconomics , 4th edition ( new york , n.y. : worth publishers , 2000 ) , pp . 446-447 . 13see-section 4 for a discussion of federal-tax-incentives for personal-saving . 14people can save for retirement using-rules of thumb , such as saving a fixed-percentage of income in an employer-sponsored-retirement saving-plan or saving $ 2,000 each year in an individual-retirement-account ( ira ) . q1.5 . why has the personal-saving-rate declined ? specific-goals such as retirement , college-education , a new car , or a vacation . once target-savers reach their wealth-target , they may feel no need to save more . individuals may use mental accounts-and even separate-bank accounts-to-earmark the money saved for different-uses . to ensure saving-discipline , people may use '' contractual '' or automatic-mechanisms , such as payroll-deductions , to save . a mortgage is a key-form of contractual-saving in which the homeowner 's commitment to repay the principal borrowed-compels future-saving . even though economists have various-theories to explain why people choose to save , some people do not save at all.15 low-income and even some moderate-income-households may feel that they are unable to save . others may be unwilling to save . some people may be impatient and they may discount the future so heavily that retirement-saving seems irrelevant compared to current-spending . a1.5 . no one is sure why the personal-saving-rate has declined . despite a great deal of study , economists have found no single-reason that convincingly explains the decline . instead , research-points to a combination of factors that influence the personal-saving-rate . these include-but are not limited-to-demographics , government-programs for the elderly , credit-availability , and expectations about future-income and wealth.16 • demographics . under the basic-life-cycle-model , one would expect that an increase in the elderly as a percentage of the total-population would reduce the aggregate-saving-rate . however , empirical-research has found that saving has declined across most age-groups . there is no 15for more information , see annamaria-lusardi , `` explaining why so many households do not save , '' working paper series 00.1 , dartmouth

on two decades of decline in the u.s . saving-rate , '' working paper no . 7238 ( cambridge , ma : national bureau of economic-research , july 1999 ) , examined seven possible-explanations for the decline . consensus that the aging of the u.s. population caused the decline in the personal-saving-rate . • programs for the elderly . medicare and social-security affect people 's incentives to save for their old age.17 medicare may reduce the elderly 's perceived needs for precautionary-saving to cover medical-expenses . social-security can have opposing-effects on personal saving.18 on the one hand , social-security-benefits reduce the amount-people need to save on their own for retirement . on the other hand , social-security may induce personal-saving by encouraging-workers to save for earlier-retirement-the retirement-effect . in a sense , social-security makes retirement an attainable-goal and thus can prompt individuals to plan for retirement . people may save more than they would have otherwise to supplement their social-security-benefits with additional retirement-income or because they want to retire before they are eligible for social-security and medicare benefits . nevertheless , some evidence suggests that the existence of social-security may have reduced personal-saving , and numerous-studies have attempted to estimate the saving offset.19 however , given that social-security was established in 1935 and medicare in 1965 , it seems unlikely that these programs were major-contributors to the decline in the personal-saving-rate over the 1980s and 1990s . • credit-availability . improved-access to credit reduces the need to save before big-ticket-purchases . over the last 20 years , credit cards have become widely-available , and a smaller down payment is needed to buy a house . easier access to credit may have contributed somewhat to the saving-decline . the ability to borrow together with a rise in the number of two-earner-families may have reduced the perceived need for precautionary-saving . 17means-tested-government-programs , such as medicaid , also may affect the incentive to save . for example , requirements specifying low-levels of financial-assets in order to qualify for government-benefits may discourage personal-saving . 18employer-sponsored-pension-plans also affect individuals' incentives to save for retirement on their own . as noted above , employer-pension-contributions as well as pension funds ' interest and dividend-income are part of nipa personal-income and saving . 19for more on social-security , see congressional budget office memorandum , social-security and private-saving : a review of the empirical-evidence ( july 1998 ) . q1.6 . what is the relationship between personal-saving and wealth ? • expectations about future-income and wealth . people decide how much to save based not only on their current-income but also on their expectations about their future-lifetime-income and wealth . since march 1991 , the united states has enjoyed its longest postwar economic-expansion-unemployment and inflation have remained relatively-low and stable , and the stock market has achieved record highs . over the 1990s , the booming-economy and stock market may have lulled people into a sense of complacency that good-times were here to stay . people may have saved less because they were confident about future-income-prospects , and households were wealthier because of gains on their existing-assets . as discussed below in question 1.6 , increased-household-wealth in recent years appears to have contributed to the plunge in the personal-saving-rate over the late 1990s . a1.6 . that americans save little but households are wealthier is a paradox that can be confusing . it is widely known that saving from current-income is the way to accumulate assets and repay past-borrowing , thus increasing net-worth . the flow of saving is essential to accumulating a stock of wealth-as a general-rule someone who never saves will have no wealth.20 conversely , dissaving-spending more than current-income-reduces the stock of wealth because amounts saved in the past must be drawn down , existing-assets sold , or borrowing increased . not only does saving affect the stock of wealth , but wealth in turn influences the choice to save . under the life-cycle-model , people save to accumulate assets to finance-future-consumption , and attaining their wealth-to-income target depends in part on the rate of return anticipated . assets accumulated can generate income in the form of interest and dividends that in turn may be saved . moreover , the change in net-worth not only includes the saving-flow from current-income but also reflects changes in the market value of assets accumulated by households . economists generally agree that saving and wealth are inversely related : increased wealth increases an individual's ability to consume in the future and thus reduces the incentive to save from current-income . in other words , when households ' existing-assets increase in value , people can save less from current-income and still achieve their wealth-income-target . if households' existing-assets lose value , people have to save more to attain their wealth-income-target . while the idea of wealth 20a nonsaver could get lucky and receive an inheritance or win the lottery . targets may seem abstract to the average-household , increased wealth clearly influences personal-saving through traditional-defined-benefit pension-plans . for example , gains on existing-assets reduce the amount of an employer 's contribution necessary to fund its pension-liability . figure 1.2 shows that even as the personal-saving-rate has fallen , the ratio of aggregate-household net-worth to disposable personal-income ( `` the wealth-income-ratio '' ) has risen in recent years . over most of the last 4 decades , households ' wealth-income-ratio did not fluctuate widely from year to year . over the 1960s through the mid 1990s , households ' aggregate-wealth ranged from a high of 5.3 times households ' disposable-income in 1961 and 1996 to a low of 4.3 in 1974 . since 1996 , households ' wealthincome-ratio has increased rapidly-peaking at 6.4 in 1999 . although the surge in household-wealth contributed to the plunge in the personal-saving-rate in recent years , economists agree that increased wealth does not fully explain the timing or magnitude of the decline over the 1980s and 1990s . personal-saving percent of household-wealth to disposable disposable personal-income personal-income-ratio 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 personal-saving-rate household wealth-to-income ratio source : bureau of economic-analysis , department of commerce , and gao analysis of flow of funds-accounts data from the federal reserve board of governors . over the 1990s , aggregate-household net-worth doubled in nominal terms . moreover , the mix of assets held by american-households has changed dramatically . traditionally , real estate has represented households ' largest asset ; while the total value of households' real-estate-holdings grew by 50 percent over the 1990s , real estate steadily declined as a share of households ' total assets from 31 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 1999 . meanwhile , the total value of households ' stock-holdings grew more than fourfold over the 1990s , and stocks as a share of households ' total assets increased from 10 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 1999.21 as figure 1.2 shows , household-wealth-accumulation has swelled relative to disposable personal-income even as the flow of saving from current-income has dwindled . recent-research estimated that the growth in households ' aggregate-net-worth over the 1960s and during the early-1990s was roughly equally divided between traditional-saving and the increase in the nominal-value of existing-assets . over the 1970s and 1980s , the increase in the nominal-value of existing-assets was estimated to be about twice as large as the flow from saving.22 in recent years , nominal-gains on households ' assets-particularly financial-assets-have dwarfed the saving-flow . for example , in 1999 , even though personal-saving was less than $ 150 billion , households ' wealth still grew by $ 5.2 trillion ( 14 percent ) . as americans learned in 2000 when the stock market declined from its peak-value , what goes up can come down . aggregate-household wealth in 2000 declined for the first time since data were available in 1945 . according to the latest estimates , personal-saving in 2000 was - $ 8.5 billion , but households ' wealth declined by nearly $ 842 billion ( 2 percent ) largely as a result of the drop in the market value of households ' stock-holdings . the total value of households ' stock-holdings declined by nearly 18 percent in 2000 , and stocks as a share of households ' total assets declined to less than 24 percent . households ' wealth-income-ratio dropped from its 1999 peak of 6.4 to 5.9 in 2000 but remains relatively high compared to the 1960s through the mid 1990s . the basic-life-cycle-model of saving holds that people are trying to smooth their standard of living over their lifetime . therefore , life-cycle-savers 21households hold stocks directly as well as indirectly through mutual funds , pension funds , life-insurers , and trusts . 22william g. gale and john sabelhaus , `` perspectives on the household saving-rate , '' brookings papers on economic activity ( 1:1999 ) , pp . 181-224 . page 29 gao-01-591sp national-saving would not treat gains on existing-assets as a windfall to spend today . the theory predicts that anticipated wealth-changes would not affect planned-lifetime-spending . likewise , changes in wealth perceived to be temporary due to fluctuating-market-values of assets would not affect planned spending . however , people can respond to an unexpected-increase in wealth that they think will be permanent by spending more of their current-income . this change in spending in response to a change in wealth is called the wealth-effect . some people may tap their wealth by selling-stocks or borrowing against their home-equity to boost current-consumption . the wealth-effect can also work in the opposite-direction . a dramatic-drop in household-wealth-for-example , due to an extended downturn in the stock-market-could eventually dampen household-consumption and lead to an increase in saving . the increase in spending at any one time due to the wealth-effect would be expected to be small , given a life-cycle saver's tendency to spread consumption of a significant-change in wealth over time . researchers estimate that each dollar in increased wealth-increases-consumption by a few cents . estimates of the wealth-effect range from 1 to 7 cents , and the typical-estimate is about 3 to 4 cents . a recent-study estimated that a wealth-effect of 3 to 4 cents could explain two-fifths to about half of the decline in the personal-saving-rate since 1988.23 23annamaria-lusardi , jonathan skinner , and steven venti , `` saving puzzles and saving policies in the united states , '' working paper no . 8237 ( cambridge , ma : national bureau of economic-research , april 2001 ) . page 30 gao-01-591sp national-saving q1.7 . if household-wealth has increased , does it matter if the personal-saving-rate has declined ? a1.7 . with the personal-saving-rate around zero or negative , economists have questioned the relevance of the nipa personal-saving measure.24 wealth measures , which reflect the value of existing-assets based on current-market-conditions , show a fundamentally different-trend , as illustrated in figure 1.2.25 although these supplementary-measures may explain why individual-households may choose to save less , the nipa personal-saving-rate shows that people are consuming virtually all of their current-income and saving little for the future . in evaluating the level of personal-saving , it is important to distinguish between saving as a source to finance the nation's capital-formation and saving as a way for individual-households to finance-future-consumption . a key-difference between measuring the nation 's saving and gauging a household 's finances is the treatment of changes in the market value of existing-assets . as discussed in section 2 , it is saving from current-income-not-gains on existing assets-that is key to financing-capital-investment and increasing the nation 's capacity to produce goods and services . although an individual-household can tap the increased value of its assets to finance additional-consumption or accumulate other assets by selling an asset to another household , the transaction itself shifts-ownership of the existing-asset and does not generate new economic-output . thus , the nation as a whole may not be able to consume and invest more.26 moreover , all households may not be able to simultaneously tap their apparent-wealth to finance-consumption because large-scale-asset-sales could tend to depress market values . 24to some extent , spending wealth-like-spending-income-drives down the reported personal-saving-rate . as discussed in q1.1 , realized gains do not count as personal-income , but any taxes paid on such gains reduce disposable personal-income and thus saving . if households then spend a portion of their realized gains , this spending further reduces the saving residual and the saving-rate . 25for alternative-measures including-changes in the market value of households ' existing-assets , see william g. gale and john sabelhaus , `` perspectives on the household saving-rate , '' brookings papers on economic activity ( 1:1999 ) , pp . 181-224 ; and richard peach and charles steindel , `` a nation of spendthrifts ? an analysis of trends in personal and gross-saving , '' current-issues in economics and finance , vol . 6 , no . 10 ( september 2000 ) . 26however , the sale of assets to foreigners can affect the nation 's ability to consume and invest . although the personal-saving-rate is low , economists do not agree on whether this is a problem or whether private-saving is inadequate to finance domestic-investment . on the one hand , some economists are concerned that low personal-saving is undercutting national-saving and leaving the united states more dependent on foreign-capital-inflows to maintain domestic investment.27 on the other hand , other economists have observed that strong-consumer spending-boosted by low-saving and the wealth-effect discussed above-has fueled the surge in business-investment and strong economic growth in the u.s. economy in recent years . some economists and analysts are concerned that individual-households are living beyond their means and some may have been counting on continued high gains on their assets to finance-future-consumption . if such expectations are not realized and , for example , there is a sustained stock market downturn or an economic downturn , households may have to scale back their consumption . this in turn could potentially-slow economic growth given that household-spending represents about two-thirds of the u.s. economy . however , some researchers suggest that the risk of a collapse in household-spending that would hurt overall economic growth is exaggerated because households have greater resources than the personal-saving-rate suggests . 28 although the aggregate-wealth-income-ratio rose in recent years , wealth is fairly-concentrated and not all households have experienced-gains in the stock market . to gauge the financial situation of individual-households requires going beyond aggregate-household data . the survey of consumer-finances provides detailed-data on family-net-worth and holdings of assets and liabilities.29 figure 1.3 shows that many households have accumulated little , if any , net-worth . as one might expect , high-income-families typically have accumulated more net-worth than low-income-families . 27see

social-security and personal-saving compare as sources of retirement-income ? even have a checking-account . these households might be seen as outside the financial-mainstream and thus-unlikely to be saving . the key to accumulating-wealth for retirement is simply the choice to save , although investment-choices also matter . some workers choose to save over their working-lives for retirement while others choose to save little and spend more while working . recent-research found that even households with similar-lifetime earnings approach retirement with vastly different-levels of wealth.31 even though many low-income-households have accumulated no wealth as they approach retirement , the researchers found that some low-income-households had managed to accumulate fairly sizeable-wealth . moreover , the researchers found that a significant portion of higher-income-households save little . choices about whether to invest , for example , in the stock market or in less risky , lower-yielding-assets such as a bank saving-account also make a difference . regardless of income-level , those households that do not save much will have few assets on which to enjoy gains . a1.8 . traditionally , retirement-income was characterized as a '' three-legged-stool '' comprising social-security , employer-pensions , and individuals ' own saving for retirement . in 1998 , social-security-benefits contributed 38 percent of the elderly 's cash-income . as figure 1.4 shows , saving , both through employer-sponsored-pension-plans and by individuals on their own behalf , provides a significant-part of retirement-income . pension-benefits accounted for 19 percent of the elderly 's cash-income in 1998 and income from individuals ' accumulated assets for another 20 percent . in addition , the elderly and their spouses may supplement their retirement-income by continuing to work . as shown in figure 1.4 , earnings from continued-employment represent a fourth-leg on the retirement-income-stool . 31steven f. venti and david a . wise , `` choice , chance , and wealth dispersion at retirement , '' working paper no . 7521 ( cambridge , ma : national bureau of

of data from social-security administration , income of the population 55 or older , 1998 ( march 2000 ) . currently , many financial-planners advise people that they will need to replace about 70 to 80 percent of their pre-retirement-income to maintain their pre-retirement living standard.32 according to the social-security administration , social-security-benefits currently replace about 39 percent of pre-retirement-income for a worker with average-wages ( $ 32,105 in 2000 ) . given social-security 's progressive-benefit-formula , however , the replacement-rate varies by income . social-security currently replaces about 53 percent for low-earners and about 24 percent for those who earned the taxable-maximum ( $ 72,600 in 2000 ) .33 while social-security provides a foundation for retirement-income , pensions , income from accumulated assets , and current earnings largely determine which households will have the highest retirement-incomes , as figure 1.5 shows . social-security makes up over 80 percent of the retirement-income for the first ( lowest ) and second income-quintiles . for the third and fourth-quintiles , social-security still serves as the most important-source of retirement-income . for the highest quintile , pensions are a more significant income-source than social-security , but pensions represent a smaller share for this group than either income from accumulated assets or earnings . it is important to note that these data reflect in part the fact that pensions are not a universal-source of retirement-income as is social-security . in 1998 , about 48 percent of retirees lacked-pension-income or annuities , and about 53 percent of those employed lacked a pension plan.34 32the replacement-rate can be calculated as a simple-percentage of pretax-income . or , the replacement-rate considered to be adequate can be computed in a more sophisticated way , netting out social-security taxes , other taxes , or working-expenses that will not be paid in retirement . thus , desired or target-replacement rates can vary significantly depending on income-level and other factors . 33these-replacement-rates are based on applying social-security benefit-rules to hypothetical retired-workers age 65 in 2001 who had steady earning-levels over their careers . the average-earner represents a worker who earned the average of covered-workers under social-security each year . the low-earner earned 45 percent of this average . the maximum-earner had earnings equal to the maximum taxable-amount each year .

social-security administration , income of the population 55 or older , 1998 ( march 2000 ) . personal-saving now can contribute substantially to future-retirement income , as illustrated in figure 1.5 . while most families say they recognize the need to save for retirement , many do not save in any systematic way . the congressional research service recently reported that in 1997 nearly 63 percent of workers between the ages of 25 and 64 replied that they did not own a retirement-saving account , such as an employer-sponsored 401 ( k ) or an individual-retirement-account ( ira ) .35 according to the 2001 retirement confidence survey,36 about 46 percent of american-workers have not tried to calculate how much they need to save for retirement . the survey also found that many people-particularly those planning to work the longest-underestimate how long they will live in retirement . half of men reaching-age 65 can expect to be alive at age 82 and half of women reaching-age 65 can expect to be alive at age 86 ; some will live to age 100 and older . yet , 15 percent of those surveyed expect their retirement will last for 10 years or less , and another 11 percent believe their retirement will last less than 20 years . in addition , many workers are unaware that the retirement-age for full social-security-benefits is gradually rising from age 65 to 67 . researchers do not agree on whether baby-boomers and other workers are saving enough for their retirement.37 research suggests that individuals who are not financially literate tend to save less . many people do not appreciate that saving even small-amounts over time is the way to accumulate wealth . according to a 1999-opinion-survey , low and moderate-income americans mistakenly believe they have a better chance of accumulating $ 500,000 through winning the lottery than through saving and investing a portion of their income.38 one reason for this mistaken-notion is that most americans dramatically underestimate 35patrick j. purcell , retirement-savings and household-wealth in 1997 : analysis of census-bureau data ( washington , d.c. : congressional research service , april 2001 ) . 36now in its

a growing elderly-population for retirement-security ? the value of compounding-how-money saved can grow over time.39 people might begin to save more if they were aware how much they need for retirement and that saving regularly over time is the key to preserving their future-standard of living . a1.9 . as we have reported , the united states faces a demographic tidal-wave in the future that poses significant-challenges for social-security , medicare , and our economy as a whole.40 more people are living longer , and they will need more resources to finance more years of retirement . the u.s. elderly-population-those aged 65 and over-is growing and accounts for an increasing-share of the total-population ( see figure 1.6 ) . as a share of the total-population , the elderly-population has grown from 9.1 percent to 12.4 percent over the last 4 decades . over the next 75 years , the elderly-population-share will nearly-double to 22.5 percent , according to the social-security trustees ' intermediate-actuarial projections.41 although the babyboom-generation will contribute heavily to the growth of the elderly-population , increasing-life expectancy and declining-fertility-rates are also responsible for the aging of the u.s. population.42 39compounding can be explained in terms of the `` rule of 72 . '' to find out how fast an amount saved can double , divide the interest rate into 72 . for example , at an interest rate of 5 percent , $ 100 saved would double to $ 200 in about 14 years . at a rate of 8 percent , it would take only 9 years to double . 40medicare and budget-surpluses : gao 's perspective on the president 's proposal and the need for reform ( gao/t-aimd/hehs-99-113 , march 10 , 1999 ) . 41throughout this report , we relied on data from the 2001 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old-age and survivors-insurance and disability insurance trust-funds , hereafter '' the 2001 oasdi trustees ' report '' and the 2001 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal hospital-insurance trust-fund , hereafter `` the 2001 hi trustees ' report . '' in projecting-future revenues and benefits , actuaries at the social-security administration and health care financing administration use alternative-assumptions about economic and demographic-trends , including average-earnings , mortality , fertility , and immigration . we used the intermediate-assumptions , which reflect the trustees' best estimate . due to the inherent-uncertainty surrounding long-term-projections , the trustees ' reports also include two other sets of assumptions , a high-cost and a low-cost-alternative . 42other-nations , both developed and developing , are experiencing similar and often more pronounced-aging of their populations . figure 1.6 : aged population nearly doubles from today as a share of total u.s. population ( 1960-2075

source : gao analysis of data from the office of the actuary , social-security administration . as people live longer and have fewer children , there will be relatively fewer workers supporting each retiree unless retirement-patterns change . as figure 1.7 shows , there were about five workers supporting each retiree in 1960 . today , there are approximately 3.4 workers for each social-security beneficiary and by 2030 , this number is projected to fall to 2.1 , according to the trustees' intermediate-actuarial assumptions . those workers will have to produce the goods and services to maintain their own standard of living as well as to finance government-programs and other commitments for the baby-boomers ' retirement . even as there are relatively fewer workers to pay taxes to finance social-security and medicare , these programs will have to provide benefits over longer periods of time as life-expectancies rise . figure 1.7 : relatively fewer workers will support more

payroll-taxes of current-workers are used to pay retirement , disability , and survivor-benefits for current-beneficiaries . social-security now collects more in payroll-taxes than it pays in benefits , but just 15 years from now this will be reversed , as shown in figure 1.8 . beginning in 2016 , the program faces cash deficits as benefit-payments are projected to outpace cash-revenue . absent meaningful-reform , the social-security-trust fund will be exhausted in 2038 , and projected-tax-revenue would be adequate to pay for only 73 percent of projected benefits thereafter . 43social-security consists of two separate-trust-funds : old-age and survivors-insurance , which funds retirement and survivors benefits , and disability insurance , which provides benefits to disabled-workers and their families . these two accounts are commonly combined in discussing the social-security program . for purposes of this product , any reference to the social-security-trust fund refers to the combined old-age , survivors , and disability insurance ( oasdi ) trust-funds . page 41 gao-01-591sp national-saving billions of 2000 dollars 4000 3000 2000 1000 0 -1000 2000 2005

medical-insurance ( smi ) component of medicare , which covers outpatient-services and is financed through general-revenues and beneficiary-premiums . smi-accounts for somewhat more than 40 percent of medicare spending and is expected to account for a growing-share of total-program-dollars . as with social-security , medicare spending will swell as the elderly-population-increases . moreover , medicare costs are expected to increase faster than the rest of the economy . projected growth in medicare reflects the escalation of health-care-costs at rates well exceeding-general rates of inflation . increases in the number and quality of health-care-services have been fueled by the explosive-growth of medical-technology . billions of 2000 dollars 600 400 200 0 -200 -400 -600 2000 2005

social-security and medicare will be felt sooner as the baby-boom-generation begins to retire . as shown in figures 1.8 and 1.9 , the social-security and medicare hi cash deficits are expected to grow substantially in the near-future . regardless of whether the trust-funds are relying on interest income or drawing down their balances to pay benefits , the government as a whole must come up with the cash by reducing overall-budget-surpluses , borrowing from the public , increasing other taxes , or reducing-spending for other programs.44 without reform , the combined financial-burden of social-security and medicare on future-taxpayers becomes unsustainable . as figure 1.10 shows , the cost of these two programs combined would nearly-double as a share of the payroll-tax-base over the long term . assuming no other changes , these programs would constitute a substantial-drain on the earnings of our future-workers . 2000 2025 2050 2075 note : projections based on the

administration . personal-saving plays a dual-role in bolstering-retirement security for american-workers . for individuals , assets accumulated by saving provide a key-source of retirement-income ( see q1.8 ) . those who do not save and who do not have pensions will have to depend largely on social-security in their old age . according to the 2001 retirement confidence-survey , many 44q4.10 discusses how the social-security-trust fund , for example , affects federal government-saving and national-saving . page 45 gao-01-591sp national-saving workers are not confident that social-security ( 65 percent ) and medicare ( 57 percent ) will continue to provide benefits equivalent to those received today . anticipating potential-benefit-cuts , people could save more now to supplement their future-retirement income and to cushion against future health-care-costs or they could choose to work longer and delay retirement . alternatively , they might not save more or work longer , and they would experience a lower standard of living in retirement . for the nation , personal-saving provides resources vital to enhancing the nation 's productive-capacity . saving more today , in turn , can improve the outlook for social-security and medicare . as discussed in section 3 , higher saving and investment can boost worker-productivity and lead to greater economic growth . a larger economy would mean higher real-wages for future-workers and in turn more payroll-taxes to finance social-security and medicare . with an aging-population and a slowly growing-workforce , increasing the nation 's future economic-capacity is critical to ensuring-retirement-security in the 21st century . section 2 national-saving overview q2.1 . what is national-saving and how is it measured ? a2.1 . just as for people , saving for the national-economy is the act of setting some of current-income aside for the future instead of spending it for current-consumption . in nipa , saving is measured as current-income less current-consumption-expenditures . national-saving is the sum of saving by households , businesses , and all levels of government ( federal , state , and local ) . for the economy as a whole , national-saving is the portion of the nation 's income not used for private and public-consumption . the sum of national-saving and saving borrowed from abroad represents the total-amount of resources available for investment , that is , the purchase of capital-goods-plant , equipment , software , houses,1 and inventories-by-businesses and governments.2 saving and investing today increase the nation 's stock of capital-goods to be used in the future-the capital stock- and thus the nation 's capacity to produce goods and services in the future . national-saving is measured in two ways-gross national-saving or net national-saving . gross national-saving is a nation 's total-income minus its consumption and represents resources available for domestic or foreign investment . some portion of gross national-saving pays for replacing-capital-goods that have been worn out or used up in producing-goods and services-consumption of fixed capital in technical-terms , or hereafter simply depreciation.3 the other portion of gross national-saving , which is used to add to the nation 's stock of capital-goods , is net national-saving . net national-saving is the measure commonly used to gauge whether the nation 's capacity to produce goods and services in the future is increasing or decreasing . by itself , the dollar-amount of national-saving is not a particularly meaningful-indicator of the portion of the nation's income that is not consumed . national-saving is usually expressed as a share of the nation's 1investment in owner-occupied residential-property is defined as business-investment . 2this represents the current nipa definition of investment used throughout this primer unless otherwise stated . other ways of thinking about national-saving and investment are discussed in q2.4 and in sections 3 and 4 . 3for more information on how depreciation is measured in nipa , see arnold katz and shelby herman , `` improved-estimates of fixed reproducible tangible-wealth , 1929-95 , '' survey of current business , bureau of economic-analysis , vol . 77 , no . 5 ( may 1997 ) , pp . 69-92 , and barbara m. fraumeni , `` the measurement of depreciation in the u.s. national-income and product-accounts , '' survey of current business , bureau of economic-analysis , vol . 77 , no . 7 ( july 1997 ) , pp . 7-23. current-income-or its economic output.4 because the primary-measure of the nation 's economic-output is gross domestic product ( gdp ) , saving is often shown as a percent of gdp . text-box 2.1 compares gdp to another measure of economic output-gross national product ( gnp ) . in 2000 , gross national-saving as a share of gdp was 18.3 percent . after subtracting-depreciation , which was 12.6 percent of gdp , net national-saving was 5.7 percent of gdp . text-box 2.1 : gross domestic product and gross national producta gdp is the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the united states , while gnp is the output of goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by u.s. residents , regardless of where they are located . the difference between gdp and gnp is income-receipts from the goods and services produced abroad using-labor and capital of u.s. residents less income-payments for the goods and services produced in the united states using-labor and capital supplied by foreign-residents . because both gnp and national-saving include these income-receipts , net of payments , the bureau of economic-analysis ( bea ) presents national-saving as a share of gnp . however , since 1991 , bea has featured gdp as the primary-measure of economic activity because gdp is consistent in coverage with indicators such as domestic-investment and productivity . gdp is also the measure cited in economic-trend-analyses and for cross-country-comparisons by many , including the president 's council of economic advisers , the international monetary fund , and the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) . because this report deals not only with national-saving but also with other measures such as investment and the federal-budget-position , we express saving , investment , and federal-government-spending as a share of gdp . expressing all of our analysis as a share of gdp provides a consistent-frame of reference for comparing economywide-shares for the united states and for comparing u.s. saving-rates to those of other countries . in the united states , the difference between gdp and gnp is small . for example , in 2000 , gdp was $ 9,963 billion and gnp was $ 9,959 billion.b given the relatively-small difference between the two measures , the denominator has little-effect on calculating saving as a share of the economy . regardless of which measure is used , saving as a share of the u.s. economy was 18.3 percent in 2000. a '' gross domestic product as a measure of u.s. production , '' survey of current business , bureau of economic-analysis , vol . 71 , no . 8 ( august 1991 ) , p. 8. bin 2000 , gnp was less than gdp because income-receipts from the rest of the world were less than u.s. payments to the rest of the world . 4the nation 's income is the sum of all the payments made to those who produce output . this income equals the total-spending on the economy 's output of goods and services ; thus , the nation's income and output are the same . page 48 gao-01-591sp national-saving q2.2 . how has u.s. national-saving changed over time- both overall and by component ? gross national-saving is a good-indicator of resources available both to ( 1 ) replace old , worn-out-capital-goods with new , and sometimes more productive , goods and ( 2 ) expand the capital stock.5 the share of gross national-saving used to replace depreciated-capital has increased over the past 40 years . this increase in depreciation reflects a shift in the capital-stock 's composition from long-lived assets with relatively-low depreciation rates , like steel-mills , to shorter-lived-assets such as computers and software . even if gross national-saving were only sufficient to replace depreciated-capital , the economy could grow to some extent because replacing worn-out and used-capital with new equipment tends to bring improved technology into the production-process . nevertheless , national-saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciated-capital goods is important for increasing the overall-size of the capital-stock and the nation 's future productive-capacity . a2.2 . as figure 2.1 shows , gross national-saving rebounded from a low of 15.6 percent of gdp during the saving-slump of the early-1990s to 18.3 percent in 2000 . this rebound is due primarily to increased government-saving that has more than made up for the decline in personal-saving described in section 1 . however , despite this rebound , national-saving as a share of gdp is still below the level of the 1960s-an-era characterized by high saving and rapid growth in productivity and living-standards , defined in terms of gdp per capita . since the 1960s , depreciation as a share of gdp has increased slightly ( see q2.1 ) , and net national-saving as a share of gdp has declined more than gross national-saving . net national-saving rose from 3.4 percent of gdp in 1993 to 5.7 percent in 2000 but remains well below the 1960s average of 10.9 percent . 5as discussed in section 3 , a nation can use some of its saving to invest abroad and can also borrow from abroad to finance domestic-investment . page 49 gao-01-591sp national-saving percent of gdp 25 gross national-saving 20 15 10 5 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 source : gao analysis of nipa data from the

governments affected net national-saving . as discussed in section 1 , personal-saving is the amount of aggregate disposable personal-income left over after personal-spending on goods and services.6 personal-saving averaged 5.7 percent of gdp in the 1960s and increased to an average of almost 7 percent over the 1970s and 1980s . since the early-1990s , however , personal-saving has steadily declined to -0.1 percent of gdp in 2000-the lowest point in over 65 years . 6nipa personal-saving is measured net of depreciation on fixed assets owned by unincorporated-businesses and owner-occupied residential-dwellings . because household-purchases of residential-dwellings are treated as business-investment in nipa , the depreciation on these assets is included in gross-business saving . page

private-saving . business-saving reflects the earnings retained by businesses after paying-taxes and dividends . these retained-earnings are available to finance-investment . for business-saving , it is important to distinguish between net and gross-saving . on a gross-basis , businesses have been the biggest savers in recent years , accounting for over 70 percent of gross national-saving in 2000 . however , given that a large-portion of business-saving is used to replace capital-goods worn out or used in the production-process , business-saving net of depreciation is a smaller share-about 47 percent-of net national-saving . as shown in figure 2.2 , net-business saving has averaged about 3 percent of gdp from 1960 to 2000 . government-saving arises when federal , state , and local-government revenue exceeds current-expenditures . government-saving , also called a surplus , adds to the pool of national-saving available to finance-investment and allows a government to reduce its outstanding-debt or purchase nongovernment-assets . conversely , government-dissaving , or a deficit , absorbs funds saved by households and businesses and reduces overall national-saving available to finance private-investments . to finance a deficit , a government has to borrow or sell assets it owns . state and local-government net-saving has been relatively-small , ranging from a surplus of 1.1 percent of gdp in 1973 to a deficit of 0.1 percent in 1991 . the federal government 's effect on net national-saving has varied widely over the past 40 years . during most of the 1960s , the federal government was a net-saver . however , the federal government ran large-deficits through much of the 1980s and early-1990s , which reduced the overall-level of national-saving in the economy . federal-deficits averaged 3.4 percent of gdp in the 1980s and reached 4.7 percent in 1992 . in 1992 and 1993 , federal-deficits absorbed more than half of private-saving . since 1990 , deficit-reduction initiatives and economic growth have reduced federal-dissaving . from 1998 through 2000 , the federal government achieved surpluses , shifting from being a drain on net national-saving to become a contributor to it . these surpluses also allowed the federal-government-to reduce its outstanding-debt held by the public.7 section 4 discusses in more detail how federal fiscal-policy affects national-saving . despite this recent-shift in the federal-position , net national-saving as a share of gdp remains well below the average-level of the 1960s largely as a result of the decline in personal-saving . traditionally , personal-saving had been a key-source of net national-saving available for new investment . whereas personal-saving represented one-half to three-quarters of average 7for more information on debt-reduction , see federal-debt : answers to frequently asked questions-an update ( gao/ocg-99-27 , may 28 , 1999 ) , federal-debt :

of seven major industrialized countries- the g-7 . interestingly , as figure 2.3 shows , saving as a share of gdp across all of these countries has declined since the 1960s . 8when federal-dissaving peaked in 1992 , personal-saving as a share of gdp was nearly-double net national-saving as a share of gdp . in a sense , government-dissaving consumed much of the personal-saving , leaving

of data from standard & poor 's dri oecd national-income accounts database . it is not surprising that national-saving varies across countries . the increased output resulting from a given level of saving and investment depends on the investment-choices available and selected in each country . in addition , national-saving may vary across countries due to differences in the price of capital-goods , income-levels , growth rates , economic and social-policies , demographics , and even culture . for example , recent-research suggests that capital-goods are relatively cheaper in the united states than in other countries , which means it takes less saving to buy a given amount q2.4 . what are other ways of defining saving and investment ? of capital-goods in the united states than in other developed countries.9 as noted in section 1 , americans may choose to save less because they have ready-access to credit and have been confident about the future of the u.s. 10 economy . as figure 2.3 shows , japan 's gross national-saving as a share of gdp has consistently ranked the highest among the g-7 countries . japan 's high saving-rate has been attributed to several-factors including less access to consumer-credit and cultural-factors . for example , japanese-households face greater borrowing-constraints than households in the united states and must save a great deal to purchase a home . in addition , the japanese are considered to be more risk-averse and forward-looking than american 11 consumers . a2.4 . in the context of long-term economic growth , the nipa saving-definition is traditionally used to describe resources available to sustain and expand the nation 's capital-stock . since its creation in the 1930s , nipa-definitions and measurement have evolved to better portray the changing u.s. economy . nipa historically recognized tangible investments and considered other spending to be consumption.12 however , software-a-form of intangible-capital-has played an increasingly-important role in the u.s. economy . recognizing that software , like other investment-goods , provides a flow of services that lasts more than one year ,

investors ' perceptions of risk ; taste ; or households ' expectations of future economic-capacity arising from , for example , the introduction of new technology . only the last source , however , may relate to the asset 's productive-capacity . 17however , gains and losses arising from sale of assets to foreigners do not `` wash out '' and could affect national-consumption and investment . page 57 gao-01-591sp national-saving section 3 national-saving and the economy q3.1 . how does national-saving contribute to investment and ultimately-economic growth ? a3.1 . national-saving provides the resources for a nation to invest domestically and abroad . domestic-investment in new factories and equipment can boost productivity of the nation's workforce . increased worker-productivity , in turn , leads to higher real-wages and greater economic growth over the long term . u.s. investment abroad does not add to the domestic-capital-stock used by u.s. workers to produce goods and services . u.s. investment abroad does increase the nation 's wealth and will generate income adding to u.s. gnp . when national-saving is lower than domestic-investment , a nation can borrow from foreign-savers to make up the difference.1 the resulting-increase in domestic-capital would enhance worker 's productivity and wages , but the payments to foreign-lenders flow abroad . in general , saving-today-increases a nation 's capacity to produce more goods and services and generate higher income in the future . increased economic-capacity and rising incomes will be crucial as the population-ages because a relatively smaller workforce will bear the burden of financing social-security and medicare while also seeking to maintain its own standard of living . saving entails a tradeoff because it requires consuming less now in exchange for consuming more later . while those who sacrifice to save now can themselves enjoy higher consumption in the future , some of the resulting-increase in the nation 's capital-stock and the related-income will also benefit future-generations . thus , current-saving and investment-decisions have profound-implications for the level of wellbeing in the future , and current-generations are in a sense-stewards of the economy on behalf of future-generations . figure 3.1 is a flow-chart illustrating-saving 's central-role in providing-resources to invest in the capital needed to produce the nation 's goods and services . in this simplified depiction of the production-process , capital and labor are the basic-inputs used to produce goods and services . the resources used for domestic-investment come from saving by households , businesses , and all levels of government . in addition , a nation can invest more in domestic-capital than it saves by borrowing from other countries . 1when foreign investment in a nation exceeds that nation's investment abroad , the nation 's net foreign investment will be negative . q3.3 discusses the extent to which the united states has supplemented its saving and investment by borrowing from abroad . page 58 gao-01-591sp national-saving the amount of goods and services produced depends not only on the amount of capital and labor but also on how efficiently these inputs are used . this is called total-factor-productivity . total-factor-productivity is the portion of output not explained by the use of capital and labor and is generally associated with the level of technology and managerial efficiency.2 education , training , and r & d also can potentially increase output ; in this simplified flow-chart , these would influence total-factor 2the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) publishes an official measure of output per unit of combined labor and capital inputs-multifactor-productivity . bls ' measure of labor-input not only takes into account-changes in the size of the labor-force , but also changes in its composition as measured by education and work-experience . capital-inputs are measured in terms of efficiency or service-flow rather than price or value . for more information on multifactor-productivity , see `` productivity-measure : business-sector and major subsectors , '' bls handbook of methods , bureau of labor statistics ( april 1997 ) , pp . 89-98 ;

younger workers entering the labor-force need to be trained in skills to replace older workers as they retire . even as the population-ages , the u.s. labor-force itself will continue growing-although slowly , with annual-growth in aggregate-hours worked averaging about 0.1 percent after 20204-and the demand for capital-goods is likely to increase . not only must capital-goods be replaced as they depreciate , but new generations of workers must be comparably 3according to neoclassical-growth-theory , the rate of growth of labor-productivity depends on the growth rate in the capital-labor-ratio , weighted by capital 's share and the growth rate of total-factor-productivity . see robert m. solow , `` technical change in the aggregate-production-function , '' review of economics and statistics , vol . 39 , no . 3 ( 1957 ) , cited in dean and harper ( 1998 ) , p. 7 . 4the labor-force-projection reflects the oasdi trustees ' 2001 intermediate-assumptions , including those for fertility , immigration , and labor-force-participation . trained and equipped ( capital-widening ) .5 otherwise , output per worker and living-standards may fall . beyond the minimum-level of investment needed to maintain the capital-stock , additional-investment to expand the capital-stock is an important way to increase labor-productivity , and thus-future living-standards . with the retired-population projected to swell after 2010 , investment in new capital is an important way to raise the productivity of the slowly growing-labor-force . investment boosts labor-productivity because workers can produce more per hour when they have more and better equipment and better skills ( capital deepening ) . the essence of this point can be illustrated with a simple-example . consider the transformation of ditch-digging from a relatively-slow and somewhat imprecise-process involving several ordinary-shovels , much-labor-effort , and low-skill-levels to a faster and more precise-process often involving a single-power digger controlled by a skilled-operator . the elements of this example , repeated across millions of individual-tasks , encapsulates the difference between an advanced industrial-economy with a high standard of living and a less developed-country with a low-standard of living . growth in output per worker also depends on total-factor-productivity growth . a higher rate of technological-change and improved efficiency in using-labor and capital can boost gdp and thus-future living-standards . even if there were no net investment-that is , if gross-investment were only enough to replace depreciated-capital-the-economy could grow to some extent because the new capital tends to embody improved technology . however , there is no agreement on how to raise total-factor-productivity . spending on education and r & d is thought to help because 5while the aging of the population is a commonly voiced argument for raising national-saving , some analysts maintain that the projected decline in labor-force-growth will increase the capital-labor-ratio and reduce the return to capital while raising the productivity of labor . they conclude that , under some circumstances , saving should actually decline slightly in response to population aging . other analysts point out , however , that if the economy is operating below the optimal-saving-rate , saving can rise without overly depressing-market-rates of return and , therefore , provide significant-improvement to future-incomes . in addition , saving can be invested abroad without lowering the global-rate of return . see douglas w. elmendorf and louise m. sheiner , `` should america save for its old age ? fiscal-policy , population aging , and national-saving , '' journal of economic-perspectives , vol . 14 , no . 3 , summer 2000 , pp . 57-74 ;

labor-productivity growth is the rate of increase in nonfarm-business-sector output per hour worked . economic-research suggests investment in information technology also may have led to faster growth in total-factor-productivity since 1995.10 as noted earlier , total-factor-productivity growth reflects technological-change and new and better ways of organizing production . firms producing-computers and semiconductors have achieved substantial-operating-efficiencies and high rates of return on capital-investments in recent years , despite a large expansion in their capital-stock . these high rates of return seem to contradict economists ' general-expectations that increasing the supply of capital reduces its return and thus seems to indicate a rise in total-factor-productivity . although total-factor-productivity growth appears to have risen , the pace of growth may decelerate . technological-advances generally come in waves that crest and eventually subside . abundant saving alone does not always generate robust-growth because the saving must also be invested well . japan 's economy over the 1990s demonstrated that high saving can coincide with economic stagnation . among the reasons offered for japan 's lengthy-slowdown is poor-investment-choices due in part to its less developed financial markets in which savers had fewer options and were left with low-returns . also , the government 's role both in investing in physical-infrastructure and in allocating-capital to industrial borrowers at preferential-rates also resulted in many low-yielding investments . finally , with its high postwar-investment-levels , japan 's production-processes became more capital intensive compared to most other advanced-nations . with this greater capital intensity , diminishing-returns to capital have reduced the return on investment in japan over the years.11 10however , some economists are concerned that the acceleration may be concentrated in durable-manufacturing rather than widely disseminated throughout the economy . see robert j. gordon , `` does the 'new economy ' measure up to the great-inventions of the past ,

borrowing affect the economy ? a3.3 . an economy that is not open to international-trade and investment must rely solely on its own saving to provide the resources to invest in plant , equipment , and other forms of capital . in contrast , citizens , companies , and governments in an open-economy such as the united states can finance the gap between domestic-investment and national-saving with foreign investment in the united states . in essence , the u.s. economy can borrow the saving of other countries to finance more investment than u.s. national-saving would permit . figure 3.2 shows the difference between domestic-investment and national-saving , which is defined in the nipa as net foreign investment . over most of the 1980s and 1990s , the u.s. was able to invest more than it saved by attracting financing from abroad . this means that the united states has been a net-borrower of saving from other nations . 12in practice , measurement-errors create some divergence between these balances . for a more detailed-discussion of the current-account-balance , see douglas b. weinberg , `` u.s. international transactions , third quarter 2000 , '' survey of current business ,

22 , 2000 ) ; and cbo memorandum : causes and consequences of the trade-deficit : an overview , congressional budget office ( march 2000 ) . when the united states runs a trade-deficit , foreigners buy less than a dollar 's worth of u.s. goods and services with every dollar they earn on their exports sold to the united states . they generally invest those excess-dollars in u.s. assets . their willingness to acquire u.s. assets -i.e. , to lend to the united states- allows the united states to run trade-deficits . in fact , u.s. trade-deficits may be as much due to foreigners' willingness to acquire u.s. assets as to the u.s. desire to acquire foreign-goods and services . while using foreign investors ' saving allows u.s. domestic-investment to exceed national-saving , these financial-inflows have implications for the nation 's economic growth and for future-living-standards . this effect depends in part on how the borrowed funds are used . to the extent that borrowing from abroad-finances domestic-investment , the foreign-borrowing adds to the nation's capital-stock and boosts productive-capacity . this augments future-income , although a portion of the income generated by the investment will be paid to foreign-lenders . however , if the borrowing from abroad is used to finance-consumption , short-term wellbeing is improved but the ability to repay the borrowing in the future will not be enhanced . in this respect , u.s. experience in the 1990s differs from that of the 1980s . over the 1980s , mounting federal-deficits and the decline in personal-saving reduced the supply of national-saving available for investment . although borrowing from abroad helped finance additional-investment , consumption rose more than domestic-investment during the 1980s . in contrast , since 1992 there has been an upward-trend in u.s. national-saving while domestic-investment has surged . borrowing from abroad has allowed the united states to overcome its saving shortfall and take advantage of productive-investment opportunities . the increased investment has contributed to higher gdp growth in recent years , and the stronger economy should help in servicing the debt owed to foreigners . persistent u.s. current-account-deficits have translated into a rising-level of indebtedness to other countries . figure 3.3 shows the net u.s. ownership of foreign assets-the-net international-investment position13-and net-income-receipts on net u.s. assets abroad . prior to 1986 , the united states had been a net-creditor because its

gao-01-591sp national-saving 1986 . although foreign-asset-holdings in the united states have swelled in recent years , not until 1998 did the united states pay more in interest , dividends , and other investment-returns to other countries than it received on the assets it held abroad . the lag reflects the fact that the rate of return on u.s. assets abroad consistently exceeded the return on foreign-owned-assets in the united states.14 so far , the net-payments from the united states to foreign-lenders have been small as a share of gdp , as shown in figure 3.3 . figure 3.3 : net u.s.

increase its reliance on foreign-capital-inflows . investors generally try to achieve some balance in the allocation of their portfolios , and u.s. assets already represent a significant-share of foreign-portfolios . although the united states accounts for 30 percent of global gdp , it received two-thirds of the saving exported by countries with current-account surpluses in 1999.15 given this , it may not be realistic to expect ever-increasing foreign investment in the united states , as has been the case in recent years . net foreign investment in the united states might even decrease from the recent high rates if foreign investors find more attractive-opportunities elsewhere . over the long term , many other nations currently financing-investment in the united states will themselves be confronted with aging-populations and declining national-saving . thus , continuing to rely on foreign-lenders to finance such a large-share of u.s. domestic-investment is not a viable-strategy over the long run . if the net-inflow of foreign investment were to diminish , the united states would no longer be able to invest so much more in the domestic-capital-stock than it saves . although a nation can run current-account-deficits for extended periods of time , a low-level of national-saving implies a low-level of domestic-investment over the long run . according to recent empirical-research , current-account-deficits eventually have been followed by periods of declining investment.16 rather than forgo domestic-investment opportunities that would enhance the nation 's future-standard of living , the united states could increase national-saving . any increase in national 15donald j. mathieson and garry j. schinasi , eds. , international capital markets :

is the current-long-term economic outlook for u.s. national-saving and investment ? how would the long-term economic outlook change with higher levels of national-saving ? saving that did not finance domestic-investment would increase net foreign investment and improve the current-account balance.17 a3.4 . the current-long-term economic outlook for u.s. national-saving and investment is subject to wide ranging-uncertainty about economic-changes and the responses to those changes . however , one certainty is that the u.s. population is aging and there will be fewer workers supporting each retiree . this demographic-shift is expected to cause a decline in economic-growth-rates when labor-force-growth slows after 2010 . moreover , the aging of the population may exert negative-pressure on national-saving . as discussed in section 1 , people tend to draw down their assets in their retirement-years . as government-spending on health and retirement-programs for the growing elderly-population-swells , government-saving is also likely to decline . q4.3 examines the long-term-outlook for federal government saving/dissaving . to get a sense of the long-term-implications of alternative national-saving-paths , we examined the economic outlook over the next 75 years under two different-assumptions : ( 1 ) gross national-saving remains constant at its 2000 share of gdp-18.3 percent-and ( 2 ) gross national-saving varies depending on how much the federal government saves.18 one possible fiscal-policy , which we used in our simulation , would be for the federal-government-to save only the social-security surpluses and to spend the non−social security-surpluses projected over the first 10 years on some mix of permanent-tax-cuts and spending-increases . for simplicity , the save the social-security surpluses-simulation assumes that saving by households , businesses , and state and local governments remains constant as a share of 17the current-account-balance would improve to the extent that the increase in saving is used to increase net foreign investment rather than domestic-investment . research suggests that for each additional-dollar of saving , perhaps-one-third is used to increase net foreign investment and two-thirds is used to increase domestic-investment . see martin feldstein and philippe bacchetta , `` national-saving and international-investment , '' national-saving and economic-performance , d. bernheim and j. shoven , eds. , ( chicago : university of chicago press , 1991 ) pp . 201-226 . 18long-term-simulations are useful for comparing the potential-outcome of alternative national-saving-paths within a common economic-framework . such simulations can illustrate the long-term economic-consequences of saving-choices that are made today . simulations should not be viewed as forecasts of economic-outcomes 50 or 75 years in the future . rather , they should be seen only as illustrations of the economic-outcomes associated with alternative-saving-paths based on common demographic and economic-assumptions . see appendix ii for a detailed-description of the modeling methodology . gdp at 16.1 percent-average-nonfederal saving as a share of gdp since 1998.19 as figure 3.4 shows , gross national-saving as a share of gdp remains fairly-steady over the next decade under the save the social-security surpluses-simulation . after 2010 , as spending for health and retirement-programs-mounts , dissaving by the federal government begins crowding out other saving , and national-saving begins to decline . by 2024 , gross national-saving as a share of gdp drops below the mid 15-percent-range experienced during the saving-slump in the early-1990s . by 2042 , gross national-saving would plunge below 5 percent-lower than during the great depression . under the save the social-security surpluses-simulation , gross national-saving eventually disappears , and the nation begins dissaving in 2047 . 19the 3-year period coincides with federal-surpluses and its use avoids extending the unusually low-nonfederal saving-rate of 2000 throughout the simulation-period .

establishing a tradeoff between the consumption of current and future-generations entails value-judgments that economic-theory alone can not provide . initially , increasing-saving and investment adds to the capital-stock and boosts worker-productivity and the economy's rate of growth . in the long run , a larger capital-stock also requires more saving just to replace depreciating-capital . after reaching this long-run-equilibrium , increased saving and investment yields a higher level of gdp per capita but does not boost worker-productivity and economic growth . permanently boosting the rate of gdp growth would require ever-increasing relative-shares of saving and 20since world war ii , annual-growth in gdp per capita has averaged roughly 2 percent . of course , growth was faster during some periods-the-1950s and 1960s , and the second half of the 1990s-and slower during other periods-the-1970s . page 74 gao-01-591sp national-saving investment . from a macroeconomic-perspective , any increase in saving up to the `` golden-rule saving-rate '' allows a nation to increase-consumption in the long run.21 below the golden-rule-rate , saving and investing more today-permits increased consumption . saving beyond the golden-rule-rate is counterproductive and would reduce consumption not only initially but also in the long-term . however , the nation 's saving-rate is unlikely to reach the golden-rule level , much less exceed it . given the steady-decline in the personal-saving-rate , it is doubtful that americans would willingly reduce consumption so much that the nation would be at risk of saving too much . estimates based on our long-term-growth-model suggest that the golden-rule saving-rate for the united states would be more than 30 percent . these estimates also suggest that increasing u.s. national-saving would not substantially decrease the return to capital and therefore could provide significant-improvement to future-incomes and consumption . although the golden-rule saving-rate can be a useful analytical-concept in evaluating a nation 's saving , the golden-rule is not the best policy for saving . maximizing-consumption per capita over the long term may not be socially-optimal if people value current-consumption more than future-consumption and discount the future . another way to gauge national-saving is to estimate how much we need to save to achieve specific national-objectives . in simple-terms , the nation could act like a `` target-saver . '' for example , a key-target would be saving enough to afford the nation 's costs for supporting the aging-population . boosting saving and gdp is unlikely to prevent a rise in the share of gdp devoted to government-spending on the elderly because economic growth also tends to increase health-spending and raise retirement benefits- although with a lengthy-lag for the latter . a more realistic-goal would be to increase saving by an amount that would generate a rise in future gdp equivalent to the increase in spending on the elderly . recent economic-research estimated that increasing-saving as a share of gdp by one percentage point above the 1999 rate would boost gdp enough to cover 95 percent of the increase in elderly costs between now and 2050.22 this is 21the golden-rule saving-rate maximizes consumption per capita over the long run . for a more extensive-discussion , see n. gregory mankiw , macroeconomics , fourth-edition ( new york , n.y. : worth publishers , 2000 ) , pp . 90-97 ; or olivier blanchard , macroeconomics , second edition ( upper saddle river , n.j. : prentice hall , 2000 ) , pp . 214-220 . 22see barry bosworth , `` challenges to capital flows , '' csis policy summit on global aging , washington , d.c. , january 26 , 2000 . page 75 gao-01-591sp national-saving equivalent to increasing national-saving to 19.3 percent of gdp from 18.3 percent used in our constant 2000 saving-rate simulation . while it is unclear just what the right-level of saving is , it is clear that america needs to begin saving more if it is to avoid severe-problems in the future . saving now is vital because expanding the nation 's productive-capacity through national-saving and investment is a long-term-process . while saving the social-security surpluses is a laudable fiscal-policy-goal , americans need to save more to ensure their own retirement-security as well as the nation 's future-prosperity . increased saving by current-generations would expand the nation 's capital-stock , allowing-future generations to better afford the nation 's retirement-costs while also enjoying higher standards of living . section 4 national-saving and the government q4.1 . how has federal fiscal-policy affected u.s. national-saving ? a4.1 . federal fiscal-policy affects the federal-surplus or deficit which , when measured on a nipa-basis , represents the amount of federal government-saving or dissaving , which in turn directly affects national-saving . federal-deficits subtract from national-saving by absorbing-funds saved by households , businesses , and other levels of government that would otherwise be available for investment . to finance a budget-deficit , the federal government borrows from the public by issuing-debt-securities , adding to its debt held by the public.1 conversely , federal-surpluses , as measured under nipa , add to national-saving and increase resources available for investment . when a budget-surplus occurs , the federal government can use excess-funds to reduce the debt held by the public . text-box 4.1 explains how the nipa surplus or deficit differs from the federal unified-budget-surplus or deficit . while the nipa measure reflects how government-saving affects national-saving available for investment , the unified-budget-measure is the more common-frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal-policy-issues . given that the two measures are roughly-similar as a share of gdp , in this section we use the unified-budget-measure unless otherwise specified . 1federal-debt held by the public is also called `` publicly held debt '' but is not the same as `` public-debt . '' debt held by the public plus debt held by government-accounts , such as budget-trust-funds , compose gross federal-debt . for more information , see federal-debt : answers to frequently asked questions-an update ( gao/ocg-99-27 , may 1999 ) . page 77 gao-01-591sp national-saving text-box 4.1 : how do the nipa and federal unified-budget-concepts of federal-surpluses and deficits differ ? in 2000 , the nipa federal-surplus was 2.2 percent of gdp while the unified-budget-surplus was 2.4 percent . although the two measures are roughly-similar , there are some conceptual-differences . the federal unified-budget-measure is generally a cash or cash-equivalent-measure in which receipts are recorded when received and expenditures are recorded when paid regardless of the accounting-period in which the receipts are earned or the costs incurred . thus , the unified-surplus reflects the difference between federal-receipts and all federal-government-outlays including those used to purchase capital-goods , such as roads , buildings , and weapons-systems . the nipa federal-budget-surplus , however , reflects the current , or operating , account of the federal government and does not count purchases of capital-goods as current-spending . instead , nipa includes a depreciation-charge ( `` consumption of general-government fixed capital '' ) in current-spending as a proxy for the contribution of capital to the output of government-services . the nipa and federal unified-budget-measures also differ in their treatment of federal-employees ' pension-programs . in the unified-budget , federal-employee pension-benefits are recorded as outlays when paid in cash ; these outlays are offset , in whole or in part , by the government 's and employees ' contributions to the pension-programs . nipa , on the other hand , counts the government's contribution to the pension-programs as an outlay to the household-sector , where the contribution is added to personal-income and saving . the benefits paid by the pension-programs are not counted as government-outlays under nipa but rather as a drawdown of accumulated household-assets . other differences between the unified-budget and nipa-measures arise because nipa focuses on current-income and production within the united states . for example , nipa excludes capital-transfers , like estate-tax-receipts , which are recorded as revenue in the unified-budget , and investment-grants-in-aid to state and local governments , which the unified-budget-records as outlays . lastly , revenue and spending related to puerto rico , the virgin islands , and other u.s. territories are counted in the federal unified-budget but not in nipa . the unified-budget-measure is useful in explaining annual changes in the federal-debt held by the public . the nipa measure is useful in explaining how government-saving has affected net national-saving available for investment . again , these measures yield roughly-similar estimates of the federal government 's budget position as a share of gdp . in order to provide a consistent-frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal-policy-issues , this section refers to the unified-budget-measure unless otherwise specified . note : for more details , see laura m. beall and sean p. keehan , '' federal-budget estimates , fiscal year 2001 , '' survey

available for investment.2 since 1990 , the congress and the president have taken action to eliminate the annual federal-budget-deficit through several-initiatives including the budget enforcement act of 1990 , the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 , and the balanced budget act of 1997 . as noted in section 2 , the combination of these policy-actions and strong economic growth reduced federal government-dissaving over the 1990s ( see figure 4.1 ) . with the swing to surplus in recent years , federal government-saving added to the saving of other sectors to increase the amount of national-saving available for investment . unified-budget-surpluses since 1998 have been the longest-running-surpluses in over 50 years , and federal-budget-surpluses are projected for the next decade . so far , the federal government has used excess-funds to reduce debt held by the public , paying down $ 223 billion in fiscal year 2000 alone.3 2see figure 2.2 for the composition of net national-saving from 1960 to 2000 . 3federal-debt : debt-management actions and future-challenges ( gao-01-317 , february 28 , 2001 ) . as discussed further in text-box 4.2 , if the projected budget-surpluses materialize , the federal government will reach a point at which the projected surpluses will exceed the amount of federal-debt available to be redeemed . page 79 gao-01-591sp

increase in national-saving , changes in federal-saving do not flow through to changes in national-saving and investment in a dollar-for-dollar-relationship . figure 4.1 illustrates that federal and nonfederal-saving , which consist mainly of private-saving , tend to be inversely related . in other words , when federal government-saving increases ( smaller deficits or larger surpluses ) , private-saving may decrease somewhat . when federal-saving-decreases ( smaller surpluses or larger deficits ) , private-saving may increase . for example in figure 4.1 , although federal government-saving increased as a share of gdp by 5.5 percentage points from 1990 to 2000 , net national-saving increased by only 1.1 percentage points because private-saving as a share of gdp decreased by 4.9 percentage points over the same period.4 4the total-change in net national-saving from 1990 to 2000 was also affected by an increase in state and local-government-saving of about 0.6 percentage points . page 80 gao-01-591sp national-saving q4.2 . why do government and private-saving tend to move in opposite-directions ? a4.2 . government and private-saving tend to move in opposite-directions for several-reasons-three of which are discussed here . first , federal-borrowing can be large enough to affect current interest rates , which in turn may influence private-saving and investment . government-dissaving absorbs funds available for private-investment and puts upward-pressure on interest rates . higher interest rates both raise the return on saving and reduce the market value of existing financial-assets issued when rates were lower.5 the combination of higher returns to saving and reduced wealth might encourage households and businesses to save more . conversely , an increase in government-saving adds to the supply of resources available for investment and may put downward-pressure on interest rates . lower interest rates both reduce the return on saving and increase the market value of existing financial-assets issued when rates were higher . lower returns to saving and increased wealth might dampen private-saving . second , if federal-budget-surpluses are achieved , in part , through higher taxes , those higher taxes reduce households' disposable personal-income . as discussed in section 1 , disposable personal-income is the after-tax personal-income ( including government-transfer-payments ) available for households ' consumption and saving . households may choose to save less of their disposable-income and maintain their current level of consumption especially if they consider the higher tax-payments to be temporary . reduced personal-saving would tend to offset the increased government-saving due to higher taxes . third , some economists believe that government-saving has some effect on households ' expectations about future-tax-rates even across generations . this ricardian-equivalence-hypothesis holds that people are forward-looking and recognize that current government-surpluses or deficits affect government-debt and future tax rates.6 thus , when the government runs deficits and accumulates debt , ricardian-consumers would save more to ensure that they or their descendants can pay the expected higher future-taxes . alternatively , when the government runs 5for example , market prices of interest-bearing-securities , such as treasury-securities , fluctuate inversely with market-interest rates . the market price of a treasury security falls when the current-interest-rate on

'' saving some portion of the projected budget-surpluses would allow the federal-government-to reduce the overhang of federal-debt built over decades of deficit-spending . using-surpluses to reduce debt held by the public-results in lower interest-costs-today , all other things being equal , and a lower debt-burden for future generations.8 within this decade , the projected surpluses may likely exceed the amount of debt held by the public available to be redeemed . text-box 4.2 discusses government-saving in an environment where reducing federal-debt held by the public is not an option .

gao-01-591sp national-saving text-box 4.2 : government-saving when reducing publicly held federal-debt is not an option if the projected budget-surpluses materialize , the federal government will reach the point at which the annual-surpluses will exceed the amount of debt available to be redeemed or that can be bought back at reasonable-prices . although estimates as to when this point will be reached vary depending on several-assumptions , most analysts agree that it could occur within the decade ; estimates range from the congressional budget office 's ( cbo ) january 2001 estimate of 2006 to the office of management and budget 's march 2001 estimate of 2008 . this point will occur before the debt held by the public is eliminated , and the resulting accumulation of cash will require decisions about what to do with these cash-balances . this raises the question of how the federal government can save if reducing federal-debt held by the public is not an option . just as the flow of personal-saving affects the stock of financial-assets accumulated by households , government-saving affects the stock of federal-debt . the federal government borrows from the public to finance a deficit . conversely , when a budget-surplus occurs , the federal government can use excess-funds to reduce the debt held by the public , accumulate cash-balances , or acquire nonfederal financial-assets . holding-cash or nonfederal financial-assets would not reduce debt held by the public but would reduce the net-debt of the federal government . net-debt represents the federal government 's total financial-liabilities , including-debt held by the public , less its total financial-assets . positive amounts of net-debt reflect how much of the nation 's private-wealth has been absorbed to finance federal-deficits . negative-amounts of net-debt reflect how much of the nation 's private financial-assets-have been acquired by the federal government . acquiring nonfederal financial-assets could be another way to translate budget-surpluses into resources available for investment . however , the issue of the federal-ownership of nonfederal-assets is controversial . federal reserve chairman greenspan , among others , has expressed-concern that there would be tremendous political pressure to steer the federal government 's asset-selection to achieve economic , social , or political-purposes . although the governance-issues may not be insurmountable , another possible concern is that the federal government could become the largest single-investor . there is a growing-body of experience by other governments that might help policymakers address the question of whether and how the federal government can or should acquire nonfederal financial instruments . investing in the financial markets is a standard-practice for state and local-government pension funds in the united states . also , other nations have decided that the potential-risks of political-interference can be managed and are outweighed by what those nations perceive as the risk of failing to save for the future or provide a cushion for contingencies . in the future , we plan to study how other nations invest in nongovernmental-assets to learn more about how they deal with governance and other issues note : the net-debt-concept is based on the oecd definition of net financial-liabilities that can be calculated by subtracting financial-assets from financial-liabilities . in recent years , the fiscal-policy-debate has focused on the importance of saving the social-security portion of projected unified-budget-surpluses . while policymakers appear to have generally agreed to save social-security surpluses , there is considerable-debate over whether and how to use the non-social-security-surpluses . after recent years of fiscal-discipline and focus on fiscal-responsibility , the anticipated-surpluses offer a chance to meet pent-up-demand for discretionary domestic-spending , increase defense-spending , cut-taxes , shore up social-security and medicare , reduce the debt , or do some combination of these . how the surpluses are used has long-term-implications for federal government-saving , national-saving , and ultimately the nation's future-living standards.9 to get a sense of the long-term-implications of broad fiscal-policy-choices , we examined the fiscal and economic outlook over the next 75 years under two alternatives : ( 1 ) assuming that the federal government saves only the social-security surpluses and ( 2 ) assuming that the federal government saves the entire unified surpluses.10 for simplicity , these fiscal-policy-simulations assume that saving by households , businesses , and state and local governments remains constant as a share of gdp and that the surpluses saved are used to reduce debt held by the public.11 once debt held by the public is eliminated , these simulations assume excess-cash is used to acquire an unspecified-mix of nonfederal-assets with a rate of return equivalent to the average-interest-rate on treasury securities.12 9federal-budget : the president 's

forecasts . see appendix ii for a detailed-description of the long-term-modeling-methodology . 12acquiring nonfederal financial-assets would reduce the reported unified-surplus or increase the unified-deficit because , under current-budget scoring rules , such acquisitions would be treated as spending . saving the social-security surpluses produces unified-budget-surpluses for almost 20 years , as shown in figure 4.2 , and eliminates the debt held by the public by 2015 . under the save the social-security surpluses-simulation , the non-social-security-surpluses are eliminated by an unspecified-mix of permanent-tax-cuts and spending-increases . under this scenario , unified-budget-deficits emerge again in 2019-just as the social-security and medicare programs are being strained by the retiring-baby-boom generation . as discussed in section 3 , the large-deficits and debt under this simulation imply a substantial-reduction in national-saving and investment in the capital-stock leading to a decline in living standards-in-terms of gdp per capita . although policymakers would likely act to reduce the budget-deficits and to promote higher national-saving before facing the economic-doomsday implied under the save the social-security surpluses-simulation , this scenario serves as a reminder to be cautious in committing surpluses to large permanent-tax-cuts and spending-increases . percent of gdp 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2075 adata-end when deficits reach 20 percent of gdp . source : gao 's march 2001 analysis . figure 4.2 also shows an alternative fiscal-policy-path assuming the federal government saves all of the projected unified-surpluses . under the save the unified-surpluses-simulation , federal-budget-surpluses would be higher over the next 40 years , but deficits would emerge in the 2040s . although the q4.4 . how does saving affect future budgetary-flexibility ? government would have to borrow again from the public to finance deficits over the long run , the simulation implies that , absent policy or economic-change , debt held by the public could be fully eliminated before the end of the decade.13 just as the save the social-security surpluses-simulation is an implausible-doomsday scenario , the save the unified-surpluses-simulation can also be viewed as implausible . under this simulation , annual federal-surpluses , which peak at 5 percent of gdp , would last longer than ever before in the nation 's history and the government would hold nonfederal financial-assets for over 50 years . a4.4 . government-saving directly affects future budgetary-flexibility through its effect on interest-payment-spending . in the past , interest-payments contributed to deficits and helped fuel a rising-debt-burden . rising debt , in turn , raised-interest-costs to the budget , and the federal government increased-debt held by the public to finance these interest-payments . a change from a budget-deficit to a surplus reduces federal-debt and replaces this '' vicious-cycle '' with a `` virtuous-cycle '' in which saving some portion of the budget-surpluses-results in lower debt-levels . lower debt-levels lead to lower interest payments-possibly at lower interest rates . these lower interest-payments in turn-lead to larger potential-surpluses and/or increased budget-flexibility . figure 4.3 shows the long-term-implications for budgetary-flexibility of saving the social-security surpluses . again , this simulation assumes that nonfederal-saving remains constant as a share of gdp at 16.1 percent , the average nonfederal-saving-rate since 1998 . absent program-changes , saving the social-security surpluses-and even the medicare surpluses14-is not enough by itself to finance the retirement and health-programs for the elderly . as figure 4.3 shows , saving only the social-security surpluses will not be sufficient to accommodate both the projected growth in social-security and health-entitlements and other national-priorities in the long term . these programs will eventually squeeze out most or all other spending . by 2030 , saving the social-security surpluses results in a 13although-estimates as to when this point will be reached vary depending on several-assumptions , most analysts agree that it could occur within the decade ; see federal-debt : debt-management

federal-spending-priorities such as national-defense , law enforcement , and federal-investment in infrastructure , education , and r & d.15 absent-changes in the structure of social-security and medicare , some time during the 2040s , government would do little but mail-checks to the elderly and their health-care-providers . budget-flexibility declines drastically so that by 2050 , net-interest on the debt would absorb roughly half of all federal-revenue . furthermore , social-security and health-spending alone would exceed total federal-revenue . 15these fiscal-policy-simulations do not reflect other federal commitments and responsibilities not fully recognized in the federal-budget , including the costs of federal-insurance-programs , clean-up-costs from federal-operations resulting in hazardous-wastes , and the demand for new investment to modernize deteriorating or obsolete physical-infrastructure ( e.g. , transportation-systems , and sewage and water-treatment-plants ) . page 88 gao-01-591sp national-saving figure 4.3 : composition of federal-spending as a share of gdp under the save the social-security surpluses-simulation-percent of

massive-government-dissaving , reduce the economic-burden of government-spending for an aging-population , and restore budgetary-flexibility to address other national-priorities . q4.10 and q4.12 discuss the need for social-security and medicare reform more fully . just as saving more of the anticipated-budget-surpluses would enhance future budgetary-flexibility , increasing private-saving-would also improve the federal government 's budget-outlook . as discussed in section 3 , increasing national-saving-boosts investment and economic growth . because the u.s. economy is

surpluses-simulation , gdp per capita-growth slows and eventually turns negative . even if the entire unified-surplus were saved , gdp per capita-would-fall somewhat-short of the u.s. historical-average of doubling every 35 years . the implication of such simulations is that even if government-saving is sustained at unprecedented-levels , future-generations of workers might not enjoy a rise in living-standards comparable to that enjoyed by previous-generations . thus , saving social-security surpluses is not enough to ensure retirement-security for the aging-population without placing a heavy-burden on future-generations . q4.10 and q4.12 discuss how social-security and medicare reform might affect national-saving . figure 4.4 : gdp per capita under alternative

aside gloomy-simulation-results and to discount the significance of fiscal-constraints several-decades in the future , but recent good news about the budget does not mean that difficult-budget-choices are a thing of the past . the history of budget-forecasts should be a reminder not to be complacent about the certainty that large-surpluses will materialize over the next 10 years as projected . not so long ago the forecasts were for '' deficits as far as the eye can see . '' budget-projections are inherently-uncertain and even a small-change in one assumption can lead to very large-changes in the fiscal-outlook over a decade . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) describes its projections as more tentative than usual because the increase in cbo's productivity-growth-assumption is based on data only for the past few years.16 according to cbo , that limited-time-span is insufficient to determine whether the rate of 16for more information about potential-sources of uncertainty in cbo 's projections , see `` the uncertainties of budget-projections , '' chapter 5 , the budget and economic outlook : fiscal-years 2002-2011 , congressional budget office ( january 2001 ) , pp . 93-103 . page 91 gao-01-591sp national-saving productivity-growth has indeed accelerated or has just temporarily deviated from underlying historical-trends as it has many times in the past.17 some observers have declared that the u.s. economy has entered a new era of more rapid economic growth , and it is possible that future growth could be even more robust than cbo 's baseline economic-projections assume . however , cbo has pointed out that the recent-burst in productivity may prove temporary if the `` new economy '' turns out to be just a flash in the pan . in addition to the greater-than-usual-uncertainty about productivity-growth , it is too soon to tell whether recent-boosts in federal-revenue reflect a structural-change in the economy or a more temporary-divergence from historical-trends . cbo has pointed out that simply assuming a return to historical-trends and slightly faster growth in health-care-spending would dramatically reduce the surpluses projected . given these uncertainties , lower unified-surpluses and even deficits are possible-budget-outcomes over the next decade . caution is warranted before committing the anticipated-surpluses to permanent-changes on either the revenue or spending-side . although policymakers appear to have generally agreed to save social-security surpluses , there is considerable-debate over whether and how to use the rest of the projected surpluses . yet , the amounts available for new tax or spending-initiatives may be considerably less than policymakers and the public anticipate.18 cbo 's budget-projections are intended to provide estimates of federal-spending and revenue assuming current-law related to taxation and entitlement-programs is unchanged . for this reason , cbo 's projections do not reflect the full-cost of maintaining current-policies if maintaining those policies would require enacting new legislation . for example , the budget-projections do not reflect the costs of laws that are regularly extended for a few years at a time , such as continuing-payments to farmers that have been provided for the last three years or extending-tax-credits due to expire . the projections also do not reflect the expected 17see congressional budget office , the budget and

tax for middleincome-taxpayers . moreover , cbo 's inflated-baseline assumes that discretionary-spending-which is controlled through annual appropriations-will grow after 2002 at the rate of inflation . however , discretionary-spending historically has grown faster than the rate of inflation . a4.6 . not only does government-saving directly affect national-saving available for private-investment , but the federal government also is a key-contributor to the nation 's capital-stock and productivity through its own investment spending.19 for example , the federal government invests in building-roads , training-workers , and conducting scientific-research . although unified-budget-surpluses increase national-saving available for private-investment , increasing federal-spending on infrastructure , if properly designed and administered , can be another way to increase national-saving and investment . federal-spending on education and r & d- while it does not count as nipa investment-can , if properly designed and administered , also promote the nation's long-term-productivity and economic growth . gao has reported that well-chosen federal-spending for infrastructure , education , and r & d that is directly intended to enhance the private sector's long-term-productivity can be viewed as federal investment.20 however , cbo has questioned whether increasing federal-investment spending could significantly increase economic growth.21 a sound public-infrastructure plays a vital-role in the nation's capacity to produce goods and services in the future . public facilities , such as transportation-systems and water-supplies , are vital to meeting the 19fiscal-policy-choices affect not only how much the government saves and invests but also affect how businesses and households save and invest . q4.7 discusses federal-policies aimed at encouraging private-saving . 20for more information about defining federal-investment for long-term economic growth , see budget-issues : choosing public investment-programs ( gao/aimd-93-25 , july 23 , 1993 ) and related gao products listed in appendix v. 21cbo concluded that increased federal-spending on investment in infrastructure , education and training , and r & d was unlikely to increase economic growth and could possibly reduce growth . according to cbo , many federal-investments have little net economic benefit- either because they are selected for political or other noneconomic-reasons or because they displace more productive private-sector or state and local-investments . see the economic-effects of federal-spending on infrastructure and other investments , congressional budget office ( june 1998 ) . immediate as well as long-term public-demands for safety , health , and improved-quality of life . while most infrastructure spending takes place at the state , local , or private-sector-level , the federal government also invests in infrastructure such as highways , bridges , and air-traffic control.22 as federal unified-deficits declined over the 1990s , federal-investment in nondefense physical-assets remained relatively-constant as a share of gdp . federal-spending on education and nondefense r & d , which is intended to enhance the nation 's long-term-productivity , also remained relatively-constant as a share of gdp over the 1990s . at some point , reducing federal unified-deficits or maintaining unified-surpluses at the expense of federal r & d and education spending raises concerns about future-workers ' skills , technological-advancement , and , thus , economic growth . r & d and education have long been seen as areas for government-activity given the private sector 's inability to capture all of the societal-benefits that such investments provide . the federal government has played a central-role in supporting r & d and thus enhancing the nation 's long-term-productivity . one rationale for this has been that the societal-gains from r & d , for example , are often not felt until far in the future and so might not provide much-profit for an individual-firm . the internet , computers , communications satellites , jet-aircraft , and semiconductors are all examples of benefits from federal r & d investments over the past 50 years . federal r & d investment-spending on genetic-medicine and biotechnology has helped lead to the mapping of human-genes . although the human genome project has been hailed as `` the most important , most wondrous-map ever produced by humankind , '' its full societal-benefits will not be seen for years to come.23 fiscal-policy-choices about the allocation of government-spending between consumption and investment are influenced in part by the federal-budget-process . the federal government 's cash-based budget-process is largely a short-term-plan focusing on the short- to medium-term cash-implications of government-obligations and fiscal-decisions . the budget seeks to serve 22for more on the federal government 's role in infrastructure-investment , see u.s. infrastructure : funding trends and opportunities to improve investment-decisions ( gao/rced/aimd-00-35 , february 7 , 2000 ) . 23 '' remarks by the president , prime minister tony blair of england ( via satellite ) , dr. francis collins , director of the

genome project , '' the white house , office of the press secretary ( june 26 , 2000 ) . q4.7 . what policies of the federal government have been aimed at encouraging nonfederal-saving and investment ? many purposes , but one of its primary-functions is to control obligations-up-front before the government-commitment is made . as a result , the budget-process tends to view a dollar spent on consumption the same as a dollar spent on investment because both represent commitments by the government and represent resources taken out of the private sector for use by the government . some have argued that the budget may actually favor short-term consumption because the cost of both must be scored up-front as part of the budget enforcement act process even though most of the benefits from investment-programs accrue in the future.24 in the past , gao has suggested that the budget could better facilitate policymakers ' weighing-choices between federal-investment and consumption by incorporating an investment-component with agreed-upon-levels of investment-spending . this could promote the consideration of spending intended to benefit the economy over the long term while maintaining overall fiscal discipline.25 as the congress moves to modify the federal-budget-process with the expiration of the budget enforcement act , attention is warranted as to how the process considers the long-term-implications of alternative-spending-choices . a4.7 . although increasing-government-saving is the most direct way for the federal-government-to increase national-saving , the federal government can also encourage saving and investment by state and local governments and the private sector . for example , the federal government provides funding- such as grants , loans , or loan guarantees-to-state and local governments to finance the construction and improvement of the nation 's highways , mass-transit systems , and water-systems . the federal government also provides financial-aid to encourage postsecondary-education . in addition to its direct-spending , the federal government offers tax-incentives to encourage nonfederal-saving and investment . the revenue-loss associated with a tax-incentive represents the federal government's budgetary-cost of promoting-saving and investment for particular-purposes . the current-income tax-system provides preferential treatment-such as special-exemptions , special-deductions , and/or credits , as well as special 24budget-trends : federal-investment outlays , fiscal-years 1981−2003 ( gao/aimd-98-184 , june 15 , 1998 ) . 25budget-structure : providing an investment focus in the federal-budget ( gao/t-aimd-95-178 , june 29 , 1995 ) . page 95 gao-01-591sp national-saving tax-rates-for both businesses and individuals . under current-law , some types of saving and investment are exempt from taxes while other types are fully taxed ; some forms of consumption-in particular , health care- receive preferential-treatment . although a comprehensive-discussion of income versus consumption-taxes is beyond the scope of this primer , it is helpful to highlight various federal-tax-incentives for saving and investment.26 the federal government uses tax-incentives to encourage particular-forms of investment . some tax-provisions allow accelerated depreciation so that businesses can more quickly recover the costs of investing in certain-types of equipment and structures . other tax-incentives encourage investment in the nation 's infrastructure . for example , interest income on state and local-government-bonds , which are used primarily for infrastructure purposes , are exempt from federal-taxes . this tax-preference allows state and local governments to borrow at lower rates to build highways , schools , mass-transit-facilities , and water-systems . in addition , tax-preferences may encourage particular-forms of infrastructure-investment , such as special-tax-credits for investments in developing low-income rental-housing . also , special-tax-credits and deductions are aimed at spurring private r & d . the federal government also has sought to encourage personal-saving-both to enhance households ' financial-security and to boost national-saving . table 4.1 highlights some tax-provisions aimed at encouraging-saving for retirement , buying-homes , and investing in education.27 the largest tax-incentive for saving-in-terms of the tax-revenue loss-is the preferential-tax-treatment of employer-sponsored-pension-plans ; additional-tax-incentives encourage retirement-saving outside of employer-pensions . the second largest category of tax-incentives aimed at encouraging-saving promotes home-ownership . other tax-incentives encourage college and other postsecondary-education . while some tax-incentives for education encourage households to accumulate assets such as u.s. series ee savings 26for more information about the differences between income and consumption-taxes and the current-tax-treatment of saving and investment , see tax administration : potential-impact of alternative taxes on taxpayers and administrators (

people from saving . as discussed in section 1 , social-security also affects people 's incentives to save for retirement . capital gains-taxation and estate-transfer-taxes may also affect household-decisions about saving and asset accumulation . bonds or education-savings accounts to pay for college , other provisions , such as the hope credit , are aimed more at making college more affordable . table 4.1 : selected federal income tax-provisions that influence personal-saving ( 2 ) individual-retirement-accounts ( iras ) $ 15,200 ( 3 ) keogh plans $ 5,500 encourage home-ownership

gift-taxes ( jcx-29-99 ) , june 15 , 1999 . source : gao analysis based on information provided in analytical-perspectives , budget of the united states government , fiscal year 2002 . for individual-taxpayers , tax-incentives increase the after-tax return on saving for particular-purposes or on specific-types of assets accumulated . this would narrow the wedge between the individual 's return on saving and society 's return on investment that results from the taxation of income from saving . as explained in section 1 , higher rates of return may or may not encourage people to save more . for the federal government , tax-incentives reduce tax-revenue and hence-government saving . how tax-incentives affect personal-saving , and ultimately , national-saving is less certain . the net-effect on national-saving-discussed further in q4.8- depends on the interaction between any additional personal-saving and government-dissaving associated with financing the incentive . tax-incentives affect how people save for retirement but do not necessarily increase the overall-level of personal-saving . since the 1970s , preferential-tax-treatment has been granted to individual-retirement-accounts ( iras ) and employer-sponsored 401 ( k ) pension-plans . even with these retirement-saving incentives , the personal-saving-rate has steadily declined . although the tax benefits indeed seem to encourage individuals to contribute to these kinds of accounts , the amounts contributed may not be totally new saving . some contributions may represent saving that would have occurred even without the tax-incentives or amounts merely shifted from taxable-assets or even financed by borrowing . economists disagree about whether tax-incentives are effective in increasing the overall-level of personal-saving . in a 1996 symposium examining universal-iras available in the early 1980s,28 researchers reached three widely divergent-conclusions : ( 1 ) yes , most contributions represented new saving , ( 2 ) no , most ira contributions were not new saving , and ( 3 ) maybe , about 26 cents of each dollar contributed may have represented new saving.29 even if tax-incentives do not increase personal-saving much in the short term , they may encourage individual-households to earmark resources specifically for retirement . once the funds are earmarked in retirement-accounts , the prospect of taxes and penalties for early-withdrawals might induce some households to save more outside of retirement-accounts to achieve nonretirement-goals . however , if people can readily withdraw money from tax-preferred-accounts for purposes other than retirement , there is no assurance that tax-incentives would ultimately enhance individuals ' retirement-security . allowing-access to voluntary-accounts like iras or 401 ( k ) plans before retirement-through-borrowing or early-withdrawals to buy a home or to pay for education or medical-expenses-is a double-edged sword . access 28the journal of economic-perspectives , vol . 10 , no . 4 ( fall 1996 ) presented three papers representing these viewpoints : james m. poterba , steven f. venti , and david a . wise , `` how retirement-saving programs increase saving , '' pp . 91-112 ; eric m. engen , william g. gale , and john karl scholz , `` the illusory-effects of saving-incentives on saving , '' pp . 113-138 ; and r. glenn hubbard and jonathan s. skinner , `` assessing the effectiveness of saving-incentives , '' pp . 73-90 . 29researchers have also attempted to estimate the effect of employer-sponsored 401 ( k ) plans on personal-saving . for a recent summary of this empirical-debate , see william gale , `` the impact of pensions and 401 ( k ) plans on saving : a critical-assessment of the state of the literature , '' paper presented at erisa after 25 years : a framework for evaluating pension reform , washington , d.c. , september 17 , 1999 . q4.8 . given that experts disagree about whether retirement-saving tax-incentives are effective in increasing personal-saving overall , how do these tax-incentives affect national-saving ? provisions may increase saving because more people may choose to participate and to contribute larger amounts.30 yet , borrowing and early-withdrawals can ultimately reduce individuals ' retirement-income . there would be little-benefit to national-saving from allowing early-access to mandatory-accounts with set contribution levels-which has been proposed for social-security ( see q4.10 and q4.11 ) . a4.8 . the net-effect on national-saving depends on whether a tax-incentive induces enough-additional saving by households to make up for the government 's revenue-loss . to gain a better understanding of how tax-incentives affect national-saving , look at one example : how a tax-deduction for a traditional tax-deferred ira may affect government and ultimately-national saving . for simplicity , consider a married-couple in which neither spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored-pension-plan and each contributes $ 2,000-the maximum per person per year allowed under current-law-to a traditional ira . as shown in table 4.2 , how much the couple's $ 4,000 annual-contribution adds to national-saving that year depends on ( 1 ) how much their ira tax-deduction costs the government and ( 2 ) whether their contributions represent new saving or were shifted from existing-assets . further assume , for simplicity , that our hypothetical-couple 's marginal-tax-rate is 28 percent , so their deduction costs the federal government $ 1,120 ( 28 percent of $ 4,000 ) . in other words , government-saving decreases by $ 1,120 ( or government-dissaving increases by that amount , depending on the government 's surplus/deficit position for the year ) . if the couple would have otherwise spent the $ 4,000 ( i.e. , their contributions represent new saving ) , national-saving would increase by $ 2,880-the $ 4,000 increase in personal-saving less the $ 1,120 decrease in government-saving . at the other extreme , if the couple merely shifted the funds from another account or asset to the iras ( i.e. , no increase in personal-saving ) , national-saving would fall by the amount of the government 's tax-loss . the actual-change in national-saving probably falls somewhere between these two examples . table 4.2 also provides a third scenario-the-impact on national-saving if about 26 percent of the couple 's contributions represent new saving . in this case , national-saving would drop slightly , but the couple would have saved more and expressly earmarked more of their assets for retirement . 30401 ( k ) pension-plans : loan provisions enhance participation but may affect income security for some ( gao/hehs-98-5 , october 1 , 1997 ) . page 99 gao-01-591sp national-saving note : this table illustrates a hypothetical-couple in which neither spouse is covered by an employersponsored-retirement-plan and each contributes $ 2,000 to a traditional ira . their $ 4,000 ira contributions are fully-deductible . if either spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored-plan , their contributions may not be fully-deductible depending on their income . achange in personal-saving depends on how much of the $ 4,000 ira contribution represents new saving . these assumptions were drawn from three papers presented in the fall 1996 journal of economic-perspectives ; see footnote 28. bchange in government-saving represents tax-revenue-loss in first year due solely to tax-deduction for ira contribution . amount does not include revenue-forgone as a result of tax-deferral on investment-income . taxes on contribution and investment-income are deferred until amounts are withdrawn . cchange in national-saving represents the sum of the change in personal and government-saving for a simplified example focused on one household and one type of ira . the ultimate-effect of any tax-incentive on national-saving would depend on how households in aggregate respond . source : gao analysis based on 1999 individual income tax rates and irs publication 590 individual-retirement-arrangements . table 4.2 also shows the effect on national-saving of tax-deductible ira contributions under different-tax-brackets . if our hypothetical-couple were in the highest income-tax-bracket and their contributions represented all new saving , their $ 4,000 deduction would cost the government $ 1,584 and add $ 2,416 to national-saving . if they were in the lowest tax-bracket , their deduction would cost the government $ 600 and add as much as $ 3,400 to national-saving . of course , this simplified example focuses on one household and one type of ira.31 the ultimate-effect of any tax-incentive on national-saving would depend on how households in aggregate respond . a tax-incentive for retirement-saving may encourage some households to save more while encouraging-others to shift their existing-balances into tax-preferred-accounts . again , the net-effect of a tax-incentive on national-saving depends on whether the tax-incentive induces enough-additional personal-saving to make up for the government 's revenue-loss . as illustrated in table 4.2 , deductions for taxpayers in higher tax brackets are more costly for the government . although deductions for lower-income-taxpayers appear to yield a greater net-increase in national-saving because they are less costly for the government , they also offer relatively less incentive for lowerincome-families to save . low- and moderate-income-households have fewer resources and may have less capacity to contribute to an ira or to earmark more assets for retirement . most people saving through taxpreferred retirement-accounts are middle- to upper-income . although higher-income-households might be encouraged to save more by increasing the annual-contribution-limits to iras and employer-sponsored 401 ( k ) plans-currently $ 2,000 and $ 10,500 , respectively-increasing-contribution-limits alone is not likely to induce more saving from low-income-households . nonrefundable-tax incentives may not be particularly-effective in encouraging-saving by lower-income-taxpayers , who already owe relatively-little or no federal-income-taxes . in recent years , policymakers have explored providing-refundable tax-incentives and government-matching to encourage americans to save more . text-box 4.3 describes two federal-initiatives allowing governmentsubsidized-saving-accounts for low-income-families . first , the 1996 welfare 31besides the tax-deductible traditional ira , other retirement-saving vehicles also receive preferential-tax-treatment . depending on their circumstances , people may also be able to choose from nondeductible traditional-iras , new roth iras , sep iras for the selfemployed , simple-iras sponsored by small-employers , and the popular 401 ( k ) employersponsored saving-plans . the oddly named education ira is not a retirement-arrangement . page 101 gao-01-591sp national-saving reform-law allowed-states to use temporary-assistance for needy-families ( tanf ) funds to establish subsidized saving-accounts for tanf recipients . second , the assets for independence act of 1998 authorized federal-funding for a 5-year demonstration-project to evaluate the effectiveness of matching-incentives for certain low-income-savers . text-box 4.3 : individual-development-accounts for low-income-savers individual-development-accounts ( idas ) are special-saving accounts for low-income-families . in theory , idas help-lowincome families save , accumulate assets , and achieve economic self-sufficiency . idas are like the better known iras in the sense that the assets accumulated are to be used only for limited purposes . whereas iras are for retirement , idas can be used to buy a first home , to pay for college or other job-training , or to start a small business . idas are special in that low-income-savers receive matching-funds from federal and state-governments as well as private-sector-organizations as an incentive to save . usually , ida account holders must undergo economic-literacy-training as a condition of participation . the 1996 welfare-reform law allowed-states to use temporary-assistance for needy family ( tanf ) funds to establish subsidized saving-accounts for tanf recipients . tanf recipients are to make contributions from earnings , and state-matching-funds used for idas count towards a state 's maintenance-of-effort-spending-requirement . ida balances generally are not to be considered in determining eligibility and benefits for means-tested federal-programs . according to the center for social development , as of january 2001 , 29 states had passed-legislation establishing ida programs , and 32 states had incorporated idas into their tanf-plans . matching-rates and dollar-limits vary by state . matching-rates range from two-to-one in virginia to three-to-one in indiana and missouri . limits on ida balances range from $ 4,000 in virginia to $ 10,000 in south carolina and $ 50,000 in missouri . some states restrict ida use to paying for education or training . the assets for independence act of 1998 authorized federal-funding for a 5-year demonstration-project to evaluate the effectiveness of matching-incentives for low-income-savers . the ida demonstration-project provides direct federal-funding to state and local governments as well as nonprofit-community-organizations to match saving-contributions by low-income-families eligible for tanf or the earned income tax-credit . in fiscal-years 1999 and 2000 , $ 10 million was appropriated each year for the demonstration-project . in those 2 years , awards totaling $ 17.7 million were made to 65 grantees sponsoring ida programs . for fiscal year 2001 , $ 25 million was appropriated for the ida demonstration . because the first grants were awarded in september 1999 , it is too soon in the demonstration-project to fully evaluate the effectiveness of idas as a saving-incentive . sources : the center for social development , washington university in st. louis , and vee burke , temporary-assistance for needy-families and individual-development-accounts , congressional research service , january 17 , 2001 . recent-proposals have aimed at creating a broader system of subsidized-accounts to encourage more americans to save for retirement . for example , president clinton 's 2000 retirement-savings accounts ( rsas ) proposal would have provided government-matching on voluntary page 102 gao-01-591sp national-saving retirement-contributions for low- and moderate-income families.32 under the rsa proposal , a worker between the ages of 25 and 60 with family-earnings of at least $ 5,000 could contribute up to $ 1,000 annually through either an employer-sponsored-saving-plan or a tax-deferred individual account.33 a worker-earning up to $ 12,500 was to receive a two-to-one ( 200 percent ) match on the first $ 100 contributed each year and a one-to-one-match ( 100 percent ) on additional-contributions . the progressive-matching formula was to phase down as income increased . a worker-earning between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 was to receive a 20-percent-match on the first $ 100 contributed and additional-contributions . for individuals who did not owe federal-income-taxes , the government-match was to be in the form of a tax-credit to the employer or financial institution holding the taxpayer 's account . although the rsas were aimed at accumulating-assets for retirement , the proposal would have allowed limited-withdrawals after 5 years for such purposes as buying a home or paying educational or medical-expenses . at this time , it is unclear how new tax-subsidized saving-accounts might affect personal-saving and ultimately-national saving . like any tax-incentive , matching-tax-credits would clearly reduce federal-revenue and government-saving . the tax-credits by themselves would have no net-effect on national-saving : absent any change in household-consumption , personal-saving would increase by the amount of the government-match , but government-saving would decrease by the same amount . of course , the purpose of matching is to change household-behavior . government-matching of voluntary-contributions could increase national-saving if these incentives indeed induce people to save more.34 a progressive match- providing a higher match for low-income-workers and eliminating the match for high-income-workers-would serve to target low-income 32president clinton 's 1999 universal savings-accounts ( usa ) proposal would have created a more costly centralized-system of accounts with a flat annual general-tax-credit of up to $ 300 for low- and moderate-income-workers plus a 50 to 100 percent government-match on voluntary-contributions . low-income-workers were to receive a one-to-one-match on their contributions , and the match progressively declined based on income so that higher-income workers would receive a lower match or none at all . 33contribution-limits and eligibility-thresholds for rsas for a couple were twice the amount for an individual . for example , a couple could contribute up to $ 2,000 annually . 34depending on the design and implementation , government-matching could potentially reduce national-saving . for example , a household could transfer amounts from existing-assets to get the government-match and then increase-consumption in response to its increased wealth . q4.9 . what is the federal government doing to educate the public about why saving-matters ? workers who now receive little-tax-benefit from existing retirement-saving incentives . even with generous-matching , low-income-workers may not voluntarily save more for retirement . in light of the conflicting expert-views on how existing-tax incentives affect personal-saving , it is unclear how new matching-incentives might affect individuals ' saving-choices and retirement-security . a4.9 . while a great deal of attention focuses on how much-retirement saving-tax-incentives cost the government and how much , if any , new personal-saving they generate , what is sometimes overlooked is that tax-incentives remind people to save for retirement . the existence of iras and 401 ( k ) s serves to raise public-awareness about retirement-saving opportunities . advertising by financial institutions offering-iras and information about employer-sponsored 401 ( k ) options serve as reminders about ways to save for retirement . yet , even as the tax-code provides more opportunities than ever to save for retirement , americans may not understand why saving-matters . in the `` savings are vital for everyone 's retirement act of 1997 '' ( saver act ) , the congress found that a leading-obstacle to expanding-retirement saving is that many americans do not know how to save for retirement , let alone how much . according to the 1998 national summit on retirement-savings , the nation must do a better job of educating the public- employers and individuals alike-about the importance of saving more today to secure the nation's retirement security.35 increasing personal-saving is vital to enhancing individual-households ' retirement-security , to increasing national-saving available to invest in the nation 's capital-stock , and ultimately to reducing the burden on future-generations of financing-government-programs for the elderly . as mandated by the saver act , the department of labor maintains an outreach-program to raise public-awareness about the advantages of saving and to help educate workers about how much they need to save for retirement . the department of labor 's original retirement-savings education campaign was launched in 1995 in partnership with the 35final report on the national summit on retirement-savings , department of labor ( september 1998 ) . this bipartisan-summit , held june 4-5 , 1998 , was mandated by the saver act . additional national summits are to be held in 2001 and 2005 . page 104 gao-01-591sp national-saving department of the treasury and other public and private organizations.36 the saver act also requires the department of labor to coordinate with similar-efforts undertaken by other public and private-organizations . in addition to the department of labor's outreach-program , other federal-agencies also play a role in saving education . the securities and exchange commission 's office of investor education and assistance promotes financial-literacy and seeks to encourage americans to save wisely and plan for the future . the administration on aging and firstgov for seniors also provide information to educate the public about how they can better prepare for a more financially secure-retirement . in 2000 , the department of the treasury launched the national-partners for financial-empowerment . this new coalition planned to raise public-awareness about the importance of financial-literacy and saving and to help americans develop the skills they need to take charge of their financial-future . education-campaigns to promote financial-literacy and retirement-saving represent a potentially valuable-tool for encouraging-people to save more . building on policymakers ' efforts to enhance tax-incentives for retirement-saving , education-campaigns are a means to convey easy-to-understand-information about the variety of saving-vehicles available.37 efforts such as the department of labor 's saving-outreach-program can serve as a catalyst to educate employers about pension-plan-options they can offer to their employees as well as to encourage individuals to save more on their own behalf . public-education-campaigns are one way to get people started with retirement-planning . the key-steps are to calculate how much-income they need to retire , estimate how much-retirement income they can expect from social-security and employer-sponsored pensions , and decide how much more they need to save . individualized social-security statements now sent annually by the social-security administration to most workers aged 25 and older provide important-information for personal-retirement planning . the statement provides estimates of potential-retirement , disability , and survivor-benefits . it also asks statement recipients to check their listed-earnings to help correct errors and ensure benefits are correct when workers retire , become disabled , or die . the newly revised statement more successfully 36these-public-private-partnerships were a catalyst in 1995 for forming the american-savings education council . this coalition of public and private-entities undertakes initiatives aimed at raising public-awareness about personal-finance and retirement-planning . 37appendix iv includes a list of educational-websites on saving . page 105 gao-01-591sp national-saving q4.10 . how would social-security reform affect national-saving ? meets its purpose of providing basic-information to individual-workers , but further improvement is always possible.38 for example , readers may not understand that the `` current-dollar '' estimates provided reflect today 's price-level , not the price-level that will exist when they actually start to receive benefits . the social-security administration will need to continue to review and streamline the statement to make it clearer and easier to understand . individualized social-security statements also explain that social-security-benefits were not intended to be the only source of retirement-income , and the statements encourage workers to supplement their benefits with pensions and personal-saving . once they know their social-security-benefits promised under current-law , workers can calculate how much they can expect from employer-sponsored-pension-plans and how much they need to save on their own for retirement.39 knowing more about social security's financial-status would help-workers to understand how to view their personal-benefit-estimates . as discussed in section 1 , social-security-benefits are projected to exceed the program 's cash-revenue in 2016 , and the trust-fund will be depleted in 2038 . at that time , social-security revenue would only be sufficient to pay for roughly 73 percent of promised benefits . the individualized-statements disclose that , absent a change in the law , only a portion of the benefits estimated may be payable . knowing this can help-workers understand that some combination of revenue-increases and benefit-reductions will be necessary to restore the program's long-term-solvency . a4.10 . restoring social-security to sustainable-solvency and increasing-saving are intertwined national-goals . saving more today would alleviate the burden of financing social-security commitments . increased saving and investing can lead to greater economic growth , and a larger economy in turn would mean higher real-wages , resulting in more government-revenue to pay benefits . social-security reform-depending on the elements of the reform-package and the timing of implementation-could foster-saving and 38social-security : providing useful-information to the public ( gao/t-hehs-00-101 , april 11 , 2000 ) . 39the social-security administration also offers an online retirement-planner with calculators to help-workers understand how much they can expect from social-security under different retirement-scenarios . page 106 gao-01-591sp national-saving provide resources for capital-formation and economic growth . prompt-action is vital because economic growth is a long-term-process . a bigger economic-pie would make it easier for future-workers to meet the dual-challenges of paying for the baby boomers' retirement while achieving a rising-standard of living for themselves . for individuals and the nation as a whole , saving more means forgoing-consumption-today in order to consume more in the future . however , this trade-off between today 's consumption and tomorrow's consumption is somewhat-different for an individual than for the nation . when an individual-delays-retirement saving , that individual enjoys the additional-consumption in the early-years and then personally bears the burden of saving larger amounts later , working longer , or accepting a lower standard of living in retirement . from the nation 's perspective , if current-generations forgo saving for their retirement-costs , they also forgo investment opportunities and the economic growth that would result . therefore , their saving-choices affect not only their own retirement-income but also potentially affect the standard of living for future-workers . greater economic growth from saving more now could alleviate the burden that a slow-growing-workforce will bear in producing the goods and services to be consumed by a society with a large retired-population that consumes but does not work . in other respects , saving for the nation 's retirement-costs is analogous to an individual 's retirement-preparations . the sooner we begin , the less we have to save per year and the greater our benefit from compounding-growth . the conventional-measure of social-security solvency is gauged in terms of the actuarial-balance of the program 's trust-fund over a 75-year period . according to the social-security trustees ' 2001 intermediate-projections , restoring the program 's actuarial-balance over the next 75 years would require a combination of reform-options equal to 1.86 percent of taxable-payroll . in simple-terms , increasing-payroll-taxes by 1.86 percent ( a 15percent-increase over the 2001 rate paid by employers and workers ) now could head off a social-security shortfall for 75 years . delaying-reform until social-security 's insolvency is imminent would necessitate drastic-changes over a shorter period . absent reform , by 2038 , social-security 's annual-deficit would require cutting-benefits by about a quarter ( 26 percent ) or raising payroll-taxes by about a third ( 35 percent ) just to restore balance for that year . restoring social-security 's long-term-solvency will require some combination of increased revenues and reduced-expenditures . various-options are available within the current-structure of the program including raising the retirement-age , reducing the cost-of-living adjustment , altering the benefit-formula , increasing-payroll-taxes , and investing trust-fund surpluses in higher-yielding-assets . in addition , some proposals would fundamentally alter the program structure by setting up individual-retirement-accounts . before trying to explore how various-reform-options might affect national-saving , it is useful to highlight how the current social-security program affects personal-saving , the social-security-trust fund , and government-saving . • personal-saving . as discussed in q1.5 , some evidence suggests that the existence of social-security may have reduced personal-saving . the retirement-benefits promised under current-law reduce the amount-people believe they need to save on their own for retirement . although some may view their payroll-tax-contributions as a form of retirement-saving , workers need to understand that their contributions are not deposited into interest-bearing accounts for each individual but are largely used to finance current-benefits . • social-security-trust fund . in the federal-budget , a '' trust-fund '' is simply an accounting-mechanism to record earmarked receipts and expenditures.40 from social-security 's perspective , its annual-cash-surpluses are saved in the trust-fund , and the trust-fund-balance represents resources accumulated to help pay future-benefits . however , the accumulation and exhaustion of the trust-fund 's balance does not reflect how social-security finances affect federal government and national-saving . the extent to which cash-surpluses `` saved '' in the social-security-trust fund translate into increased national-saving depends on federal-saving as a whole . although the trust-fund appears solvent until 2038 , social-security will begin dissaving at the point that program-cash deficits emerge in 2016 ( shown in figure 1.8 ) . • government-saving . for the years since the 1983 reforms until 1998 , social-security surpluses partially offset a deficit in all other 40for more information about trust-funds in the federal-budget , see federal trust and other earmarked funds : answers to frequently asked questions ( gao-01-199sp , january 2001 ) . page 108 gao-01-591sp national-saving government-accounts within the unified budget.41 in effect , social-security surpluses reduced the magnitude of government-dissaving and the government 's need to borrow from the public . since 1998 , when the federal government began running unified-surpluses , policymakers appear to have agreed to using the social-security surpluses to reduce federal-debt held by the public , and these amounts would translate dollar-for-dollar into government-saving . when the trust-fund begins running-cash-deficits in 2016 , the government as a whole must come up with the cash to finance social-security 's cash-deficit by reducing any projected non-social-security-surpluses , borrowing from the public , raising other taxes , or reducing other government-spending . the save the social-security surpluses-simulation illustrates the magnitude of fiscal-challenges associated with our aging-society . absent reform , social-security deficits would contribute to government-dissaving ( shown in figure 4.2 ) and greatly-constrain budgetary-flexibility over the long run ( shown in figure 4.3 ) . in evaluating-reform-proposals , it is important to consider whether a reform-package will truly increase national-saving and '' grow the economic-pie . '' from a macroeconomic-perspective , increasing the trust-fund 's balance , without underlying-reform , does nothing to enhance the government 's fiscal-capacity to finance future-benefits . for example , crediting additional-securities to the trust-fund or increasing the interest rate paid on the trust-fund 's securities would commit additional-future general-revenue to the social-security program but does not increase the government's overall-revenue or reduce its costs . reforms that reallocate the composition of the nation 's saving and asset-portfolio may serve only to redistribute the existing pie . for example , individual accounts-discussed more fully in q4.11-affect the contributions of government and personal-saving relative to national-saving . investing social-security surpluses in the stock market affects the government 's asset-holdings but does not directly increase national-saving . as we reported in 1998 , potentially higher returns-albeit with greater risk-on the government 's stock-holdings could boost social-security 's financing and reduce the size of other revenue-increases or benefit 41during the late-1970s and early-1980s , social security's expenditures regularly exceeded-revenues , causing a rapid-decline in the trust-fund 's balance and raising-concerns about the program 's solvency . in response , the congress passed-reforms in 1977 and 1983 that together were intended to assure social-security 's solvency for a 75-year period . page 109 gao-01-591sp national-saving reductions needed to restore solvency.42 acquiring stocks or other nonfederal financial-assets would have approximately the same effect on national-saving as using the same amount of money to reduce debt held by the public . if reducing federal-debt held by the public is not an option , as discussed in text-box 4.2 , investing in nonfederal financial-assets on behalf of the social-security-trust fund could be another way for government-saving to provide resources for private-investment . most traditional-reform-options involve workers paying more for promised benefits or getting lower benefits . from the government's perspective , increasing-payroll-taxes or reducing-benefits would improve social-security 's finances and increase government saving-assuming no other changes in government-spending or taxes . the ultimate-effect of social-security reform on national-saving depends on complex-interactions between government-saving and personal-saving-both through pension funds and by individuals on their own behalf . the way in which social-security is reformed will influence both the magnitude and timing of any increase in national-saving . to illustrate the complexities in evaluating how traditional-program-reforms might affect national-saving , let's examine two basic-options that would directly improve social-security 's financial imbalance-increasing payroll-taxes and reducing-benefits . • payroll-tax-increases . at first glance , increasing-payroll-taxes appears to be a straightforward way to increase saving now to take advantage of compounding-growth . payroll-tax-increases are easy to implement and directly improve the trust-fund 's finances . however , the extent to which payroll-tax-increases would translate into increased government-saving depends on whether the cash generated by the payroll-tax-increase is used to finance new spending or a general-tax-cut . thus , increased social-security surpluses will not necessarily increase government-saving . even if the federal government saves all of the increased social-security surpluses , national-saving would not increase dollar-for-dollar . changes in personal-saving may counterbalance any increase in government-saving resulting from higher taxes . higher payroll-taxes may depress personal-saving to the extent that households have less disposable-income to save . how people adjust their saving in response to payroll-tax-increases may also depend on the form of the increase . 42social-security financing : implications of government stock investing for the trust-fund , the federal-budget , and the economy ( gao/aimd/hehs-98-74 , april 22 , 1998 ) . page 110 gao-01-591sp national-saving raising the payroll-tax-rate would affect all workers whereas increasing the maximum taxable-earning-level would affect high-income-earners . • benefit-reductions . options reducing initial-benefits or raising the retirement-age take time to implement or phase in , allowing-time for people to adjust their retirement-plans . reducing future-benefits obviously reduces future-spending for social-security retirement-benefits and stems government-dissaving . at first glance , reducing future-benefits promised to current-workers would not seem to increase resources available to invest now . however , changes in personal-saving may complement any increase in government-saving resulting from benefit-reductions . if social-security reform reduces anticipated retirement-income , many analysts expect that workers might , to some degree , want to offset this effect by increasing their saving outside the social-security system . if people adjust their retirement-plan to reflect benefit-reductions , increased personal-saving-today could provide new resources to invest . for example , raising the retirement-age reduces benefits and could induce some individuals to save more now in order to retire before they are eligible for social-security . in evaluating a social-security reform-proposal , it is important to consider that increasing national-saving is one criterion in assessing the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable-solvency . beyond weighing how a proposal would affect the federal-budget and the economy , policymakers need to consider the balance struck between the twin-goals of income-adequacy ( level and certainty of benefits ) and individual-equity ( rates of return on individual-contributions ) .43 reform elements that could increase national-saving may not satisfy these adequacy and equity-goals . for example , benefit-cuts , depending on how they are structured , could leave those most reliant on social-security with inadequate retirement-income . also , increasing-payroll-taxes reduces the implicit-rate of return for future-beneficiaries . it is crucial to evaluate the effects of an entire-reform-package considering interactions between individual-reform-elements as well as how the package as a whole achieves policymakers ' most important-goals for social-security . 43for more information about the analytical-framework for assessing social-security reform-proposals offered by gao , see social-security : criteria for evaluating social-security reform-proposals ( gao/t-hehs-99-94 , march 25 , 1999 ) and social-security : evaluating-reform-proposals ( gao/aimd/hehs-00-29 , november 4 , 1999 ) . page 111 gao-01-591sp national-saving q4.11 . how would establishing individual-accounts affect national-saving ? a4.11 . evaluating the potential-effect of proposals to establish individual-accounts can be confusing . various-proposals have been advanced that would create a new system of individual-accounts as part of comprehensive social-security reform , while other proposals would create new accounts outside of social-security . individual-account proposals also differ as to whether individuals' participation would be mandatory or voluntary . as we have previously reported , the extent to which individual-accounts would affect national-saving depends on how they are financed , how the program is structured , and how people adjust their own saving-behavior in response to individual accounts.44 to understand how individual-accounts might affect national-saving , it is necessary to examine the first-order-effects accounting for how the government might fund the accounts and then to consider how people might adjust their saving in response to a new account-program . one important-determinant of the effect on national-saving is the funding-source for the individual-accounts . shifting-funds from the federal government would affect the relative-contributions of the federal government and households to national-saving . for instance , diverting-funding from the social-security-trust fund-such as a carve-out from current-payroll-taxes-would likely reduce government-saving by the same amount that the accounts increase personal-saving . although national-saving would be unchanged , financing of the social-security program- absent other changes-would be worsened . if accounts are funded outside of the social-security system using general-revenues , the effect on national-saving is unclear and would depend on what would have been done instead with the general-funds . • if the general-funds would have been used to redeem federal-debt held by the public or acquire nonfederal financial-assets , national-saving initially would be unchanged because personal-saving would increase by the amount that government-saving decreases . in a sense , individual-accounts could serve as a way to channel saving through the government into resources for private-investment while avoiding-issues associated with government ownership of nonfederal-assets . 44see social-security : capital markets and educational issues associated with individual-accounts ( gao/ggd-99-115 , june 28 , 1999 ) . page 112 gao-01-591sp national-saving • if the general-funds would have been spent on additional government-consumption , then any increase in personal-saving due to the individual-accounts would represent an increase in national-saving . if the general-funds would have been used for infrastructure-investment , national-saving would be unchanged but more funds would be available for private-investment . • if the general-funds would have been used for a general-tax-cut , then national-saving would initially increase because personal-saving would increase by the amount of individual-accounts whereas some portion of a tax-cut would be consumed . national-saving also would be affected by how households and businesses respond to individual-accounts . regardless of the financing-source , the effect of individual-accounts would be to raise , at least to some extent , the level of personal-saving unless households fully offset the new accounts by reducing their other saving . households for whom individual-accounts closely resemble 401 ( k ) s and iras and who are currently saving as much as they choose for retirement would probably reduce their own saving in the presence of individual-accounts . the extent of the behavioral effects would depend in part on the structure of the individual-account program and any limits on accessing the funds . for instance , mandatory-account-proposals are more likely to increase private-saving because such a program would require households that do not currently save-such as many low-income-individuals or families-to-place some amount in an individual-account . prohibitions or restrictions on borrowing or other forms of pre-retirement-distributions could limit the ability of some households to reduce their other saving in response to individual-accounts . in addition to the effects on household saving-choices , individual-accounts may also affect the relationship and interactions between social-security and private pensions.45 45social security reform : implications for private-pensions ( gao/hehs-00-187 , september 14 , 2000 ) . page 113 gao-01-591sp national-saving q4.12 . how would medicare reform affect national-saving ? a4.12 . as we have reported , the current medicare program , without improvements , is ill-suited to serve future-generations of americans.46 the program is fiscally-unsustainable in its current-form , and growing medicare spending is expected to drive federal government-dissaving over the long run . despite this looming financial-problem , pressure is mounting to update medicare's outdated-benefit-design . given the aging of the u.s. population and the increasing-cost of modern medical-technology , it is inevitable that demands on the medicare program will grow . in addition to the aging-population and the increasing-cost of modern medical-technology , the current medicare program lacks incentives to control health-care-consumption . the actual-costs of health care are not transparent , and third-party-payers generally insulate consumers from the cost of health-care-decisions . in traditional medicare , for example , the effect of cost-sharing provisions designed to curb the use of services is muted because many medicare beneficiaries have some form of supplemental-health care-coverage-such as medigap-insurance-that pays these costs . for these reasons , among others , medicare presents a great fiscal-challenge over the long term . in the past , medicare 's fiscal-health has generally been gauged by the solvency of the hi trust-fund projected over a 75-year period . although the hi trust-fund is viewed as solvent through 2029 , hi outlays are predicted to exceed hi revenues beginning in 2016 . according to the medicare trustees ' 2001 intermediate assumption , restoring the hi program 's actuarial-balance over the next 75 years would require a combination of reform-options equal to 1.97 percent of taxable-payroll . in other words , averting a hi shortfall for 75 years now would require an increase in payroll-taxes by 1.97 percent ( a 68-percent increase over the 2001 rate paid by employers and workers47 ) , a cut in hi spending by 37 percent , or some combination of the two . according to the office of the actuary at the health care financing administration , the estimated-net present-value of future additional-resources needed to fund hi benefits alone over the 75 years is $ 4.6 trillion . 46medicare : higher expected-spending and call for new benefit underscore need for meaningful-reform ( gao-01-539t , march 22 , 2001 ) . see appendix v for other gao products related to medicare financing and reform . 47medicare-payroll-taxes are paid on all earnings whereas social-security payroll-taxes apply to earnings up to an annual maximum- $ 76,200 in 2000 . page 114 gao-01-591sp national-saving but , these estimates do not reflect the growing-cost of the smi component , which accounts for somewhat more than 40 percent of medicare spending . when viewed from the perspective of federal-saving and the economy , the growth in total medicare spending will be become increasingly-burdensome over the long run . according to the medicare trustees ' 2001 intermediate-estimates , medicare costs will grow at 1-percentage-point above the growth in gdp per capita each year.48 as shown in figure 4.5 , total medicare spending ( part a hi and part b smi combined ) is expected to consume 5 percent of gdp by 2035-more than double-today 's share of 2 percent . by 2075 , medicare would consume over 8 percent of gdp , according to the medicare trustees ' 2001 intermediate estimates.49 under the save the social-security surpluses-simulation , federal-health-care spending will greatly-constrain budgetary-flexibility ( shown in figure 4.3 ) . absent cost-containment-reforms , medicare spending would contribute to federal-dissaving over the long term even if the unified-surpluses projected over the next decade are saved . 48these latest actuarial-projections incorporate more realistic assumptions about long-term-health-care spending , and as result , medicare spending is expected to grow faster than previously estimated . for further discussion of the medicare trustees ' 2001 estimates , see medicare : higher expected-spending and call for new benefit underscore need for meaningful-reform ( gao-01-539t , march 22 , 2001 ) . 49including federal medicaid spending , federal-health-care spending would grow to 14.5 percent of gdp compared to today 's 3.5 percent . percent of gdp 10 8 6 4 2 0 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2075 notes : medicare gross outlay-projections based on intermediate-assumptions of the 2001 hi and smi trustees ' reports . source : gao analysis of data from the office of the actuary , health care financing administration . although future medicare costs are expected to consume a growing-share of the federal-budget and the economy , pressure is mounting to expand medicare 's benefit-package to cover prescription drugs , which will add billions to medicare program-costs . it is a given that prescription drugs play a far greater role in health care now than when medicare was created . today , medicare beneficiaries tend to need and use more drugs than other americans . overall , the nation 's spending on prescription drugs has been increasing about twice as fast as spending on other health-care-services , and it is expected to keep growing . adding a prescription-drug-benefit to medicare will be costly , but the cost-consequences ultimately depend on choices about the benefit 's scope and financing . any option to expand medicare 's benefit-package-absent other reforms-runs the risk of exacerbating the program 's fiscal imbalance and increasing-government-dissaving . any substantial benefit-reform should be coupled with adequate and effective-cost containment-measures to avoid worsening medicare 's long-range financial condition . ultimately , we will need to look at broader health-care-reforms to balance health-care-spending with other societal-priorities . it is important to note the fundamental-differences between health care wants , which are virtually-unlimited ; needs , which should be defined and addressed ; and overall-affordability , which has a limit . realistically , reforms to address medicare 's huge-long-range financial-imbalance will need to proceed incrementally . to avoid more painful and disruptive-changes once the baby-boomers begin retiring , the time to begin these difficult but necessary-steps is now . reform-options that reduce medicare 's growth rates or strengthen the program 's underlying-sustainability would raise future-levels of government-saving ( assuming no other changes in government-spending and taxes ) . however , the effect of reduced federal medicare spending on national-saving depends on how the private sector responds to the reductions . for example , greater private spending for elderly health care-by beneficiaries themselves or by employers and insurers on beneficiaries ' behalf-could offset some or all of the improvement in government-saving in the short-run . over time , personal-saving could increase if individuals choose to save more to pay for health care in their old age . section 5 national-saving and current-policy-issues q5.1 . what are key-issues in evaluating national-saving ? a5.1 . each generation is a steward for the economy it bequeaths to future-generations , and the nation 's long-term economic-future depends in part on today 's decisions about consumption and saving . the federal government has gone from the budget-deficits of recent-decades to surplus as a result of a growing-economy and difficult-decisions to reduce deficits . we appear-at least for the near future-to have slain the deficit-dragon . however , today 's fiscal good-fortune will not survive over the long run . if the prospect of surpluses over the next decade lulls us into complacency , the nation could face daunting demographic-challenges without having changed the path of programs for the elderly or having built the economic-capacity to bear the costs of the programs as currently structured . economic growth will help society bear the burden of financing social-security and medicare , but it alone will not solve the long-term fiscal-challenge . increasing the nation 's economic-capacity is a long-term-process . thus , saving now and making meaningful social-security and medicare reform sooner rather than later are important . because every generation is in part responsible for the economy it passes on to the next , today's fiscal-policy-choices must be informed by the long-term . common sense tells us that the nation needs to save more when it has a healthy-economy , sufficient-resources to meet some current-needs while still building our capacity for the future , and a relatively-large workforce . national-saving pays future-dividends-but we need to begin soon to permit compounding to work for us . from a macroeconomic-perspective , it does not matter who does the saving-any-mix of increased saving by households , businesses , and government would help to grow the economic-pie . yet , in light of the virtual-disappearance of personal-saving , concerns about u.s. reliance on borrowing from abroad to finance domestic-investment , and the looming fiscal-pressures of an aging-population , now is an opportune-time for the federal-government-to save some portion of its anticipated-budget-surpluses . higher federal-saving-to the extent that the increased government-saving is not offset by reduced private-saving-would increase national-saving and tend to improve the nation 's current-account-balance , although typically not on a dollar-for-dollar-basis . in considering how much of the anticipated-budget-surpluses to save , policy-choices must balance today 's unmet-needs and tomorrow 's fiscal-challenges . saving the surpluses would allow the federal-government-to reduce the debt-overhang from past-deficit spending and enhance future budgetary-flexibility . choices about federal-spending for infrastructure , education , and r & d as well as tax-incentives for private-saving and investment also have implications for future economic growth . increased government-saving and entitlement-reform go hand-in-hand . over the long term , the federal government can not avoid massive-dissaving without reforming-retirement and health-programs for the elderly . increasing national-saving and thus long-term economic growth is crucial to the long-term sustainable-solvency of social-security and medicare . since the economy provides the tax-base for the government , economic-growth-increases government-revenue , which helps finance these programs as well as other federal-programs and activities , and increases budget-flexibility . but saving and economic growth alone can not solve the looming demographic-challenges . saving the social-security surpluses-and even the medicare surpluses-is not enough by itself to finance the government 's commitments to the elderly . program reform is needed as well , or social-security and medicare will constitute a heavy-drain on the earnings of future-workers . in a sense , saving more yields a bigger pie , but policymakers will still face the difficult-choice of how to divide the pie between retirees and workers . the federal government can also undertake steps to encourage personal-saving . saving-education-campaigns are one tool to encourage people to save more for their own retirement . to participate in the debate over how to reform social-security and medicare , the public-needs to understand the difficult-choices the nation faces . announcing any benefits changes sooner rather than later would make it easier for individuals to plan for retirement and to adjust their saving-behavior accordingly . the federal government can explore how to design tax-incentives that induce households to save enough to make up for the government 's revenue-loss and the lower government-saving that would result . appendix i objectives , scope , and methodology personal-saving , household-wealth , and retirement-security this report is designed to present information about national-saving and its implications for economic growth and retirement-security . specifically , this report addresses the following-questions : ( 1 ) what is personal-saving , how is it related to national-saving , and what are the implications of low personal-saving for americans ' retirement-security ? ( 2 ) what is national-saving and how does current-saving in the united states compare to historical-trends and saving in other countries ? ( 3 ) how does national-saving affect the economy and how would higher saving affect the longterm-outlook ? ( 4 ) how does federal fiscal-policy affect national-saving , what federal-policies have been aimed at increasing private-saving , and how would social-security and medicare reform affect national-saving ? and , ( 5 ) what are key-issues in evaluating national-saving ? because this report focuses on the macroeconomic-implications of saving and investment , we used saving-data from the national-income and product-accounts ( nipa ) compiled by the bureau of economic-analysis ( bea ) .1 this report presents the trend in the personal-saving-rate as measured on a nipa-basis . as a comparison-point , we also examined an alternative personal-saving-rate available from the federal reserve 's flow of funds-accounts ( ffa ) .2 because ffa counts household-purchases of consumer-durables as saving , the ffa personal-saving-rate is somewhat higher than the nipa personal-saving-rate but also shows a downward-trend . both the nipa and ffa measures focus on saving as a flow from the economy 's current-production and do not include changes in the market value of households ' existing-portfolios . for information about the stock of wealth accumulated by households , we obtained net-worth data from the ffas ' balance sheet aggregated for the household-sector . in addition to 1the nipa data presented throughout this report reflect changes made in the 11th comprehensive-revision of the national-accounts in 1999 , including the reclassification of software-purchases as investment , which is discussed in q2.5 . historical nipa data were downloaded from

reserve 's 1998 survey of consumer finance to present a snapshot of individual-households ' net-worth by income level.3 fully exploring the dynamics of personal-saving behavior and gauging the adequacy of retirement-saving are beyond the scope of this national-saving report . the literature attempting to explain why and how people save-or do not save as the case may be-is extensive , and the empirical-research is conflicting . for this report , we provide an overview of the major-theories about why people save and describe various-factors associated with the decline in personal-saving . appendix iv lists the major-references used in preparing this report . for demographic-trends and the financial-outlook for the social-security and medicare hospital-insurance programs , we used the intermediate-actuarial projections , which reflect the best estimate of the social-security and medicare boards of trustees . we also examined-income-sources and amounts for those aged 65 and older

domestic and foreign investment in the united states , and ( 3 ) the u.s. net international-investment-position . to provide a long-term-perspective we focused on saving trends over the last 4 decades-from 1960 to 2000 . we also compared u.s. national-saving to the saving of other major industrialized-nations . specifically , we relied on national-saving data for the g-7 nations-canada , france , germany , italy , 3the survey of consumer-finances is a triennial-survey of u.s. families sponsored by the board of governors of the federal reserve with the cooperation of the department of the treasury . for results from the latest survey of consumer finance , see arthur b. kennickell , martha starr-mccluer , and brian j. surette , `` recent-changes in u.s. family finances : results

development.5 our national-saving trend-analysis is based on current nipa-definitions of saving and investment . we also examined-literature that presents other ways of thinking about national-saving . for example , a broader saving and investment-measure might encompass spending on education as well as research and development . these are not included in the conventional nipa-measures but are related to long-term productive-capacity . we used our long-term economic-growth-model to simulate alternative fiscal-policies and national-saving-rates . long-term-simulations are useful for comparing the potential-outcomes of alternative-saving-rates within a common economic-framework . such simulations can help policymakers assess the long-term-consequences of fiscal-policy and saving-choices made today . while long-term-simulations provide a useful-perspective , they should be interpreted carefully . given the range of uncertainty about future economic-changes and the responses to those changes , the simulation-results should not be viewed as forecasts of budgetary or economic-outcomes 50 or 75 years in the future . rather , they should be seen only as illustrations of the different budget and economic-outcomes associated with alternative fiscal-policy and saving-paths based on common demographic and economic-assumptions . in our simulations , we used a model originally developed by economists at the federal reserve bank of new york that relates long-term economic-growth-measured in terms of gross domestic product ( gdp ) -to economic and budget-factors . the key-interaction between the budget and the economy is the effect of the federal deficit/surplus on the amount of national-saving available for investment.6 conversely , the rate of economic growth helps determine the overall federal-surplus or deficit through its effect on federal-revenue and spending . in our model , the level of national-saving affects investment and , in turn , gdp growth . 5oecd national-income account data were downloaded from standard and poor 's dri database . 6text box 4.1 explains how the nipa surplus or deficit differs from the federal unified-budget-surplus or deficit . both measures are roughly-similar as a share of gdp . page 124 gao-01-591sp national-saving in general , federal-deficits measured on a nipa-basis represent dissaving-they-subtract from national-saving by absorbing nonfederal-funds that otherwise would be used for investment . conversely , federal-surpluses add to national-saving . while the nipa measure of government-saving directly affects national-saving , the unified-budget-measure is the more common-frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal-policy-issues . our simulation-results reflect unified-budget deficits/surpluses . our simulations are based on the congressional budget office's ( cbo ) january 2001 , 10-year budgetary and economic-projections7 through calendar year 2010.8 beyond that , we used-long-term actuarial-projections for social-security and medicare.9 we assume that current-law-benefits are paid in full ( i.e. , we assume that all promised social-security-benefits are paid even after the projected exhaustion of the oasdi trust-funds in 2038 ) . for medicaid in the out-years , we used the growth rates from cbo's october 2000 long-term analysis.10 interest spending is determined by interest-rates-which are held constant over the long-term-and the level of federal-debt held by the public , which depends on the path of budget deficits/surpluses within each simulation . all other spending as well as federal-revenue are assumed to grow at essentially the same rate as the economy . in other words , other spending and revenue both remain constant as shares of gdp . appendix ii presents a more detailed-description of the model and the assumptions we used . we present two fiscal-policy-simulations : ( 1 ) save the unified-surpluses and ( 2 ) save the social-security surpluses . the save the unified-surpluses-simulation assumes the entire unified-surpluses are saved and used to reduce federal-debt held by the public . the save the social-security 7the budget and economic outlook : fiscal-years 2002-2011 , congressional budget office ( january 2001 ) . 8in our modeling , all cbo budget-projections were

congressional budget office ( october 2000 ) . see appendix ii for more details about the medicaid assumption . surpluses-simulation assumes that only the social-security surpluses are saved and used to reduce federal-debt held by the public . unspecified policy actions-spending increases and/or tax cuts-are taken that eliminate the non-social-security-surpluses through 2010 . these unspecified-policy-actions are left in place through the end of the simulation-period . for simplicity , we assumed nonfederal-saving-saving by households , businesses , and state and local-governments-would remain constant as a share of gdp in both fiscal-policy-simulations . as a reference-point , we also simulated a path assuming that national-saving remains constant at the 2000 level of 18.3 percent of gdp . the constant 2000 national-saving-rate simulation reflects an unspecified-mix of saving by households , businesses , and all levels of government . to provide a useful-perspective on how alternative-levels of national-saving affect future-living-standards , we also compared our simulation-results to a historical benchmark . in the united states , gdp per capita has doubled about every 35 years . since world war ii , annual-growth in gdp per capita has averaged roughly 2 percent . of course , growth was faster during some periods-the-1950s and 1960s , and the second half of the 1990s-and slower during other periods-the-1970s . doubling gdp per capita every 35 years represents a way to gauge whether future-generations will enjoy a rise in living-standards comparable to that enjoyed by previous-generations . while this report discusses the potential-consequences of alternative-saving-paths , it does not suggest any particular-course of action . the choice of the most appropriate fiscal-policy-path is a policy-decision to be made by the congress and the president . while fiscal-policy is the most direct way to increase national-saving , how much the nation saves also depends on the saving-choices of households and businesses . we did our work in accordance with generally accepted-government-auditing standards from december 1999 through may 2001 in washington , d.c. we requested-comments from bea , omb , and several-subject matter-experts . staff from bea and omb and the experts we consulted provided technical and clarifying-comments , which we incorporated in this report where appropriate . appendix ii the economic model and key-assumptions in this report , we simulated the effect of different-saving rates on the nation 's standard of living using a standard-model of economic growth originally developed by economists at the federal reserve bank of new york . the major-determinants of economic growth in the model are changes in the labor-force , capital-formation , and the growth in total-factor-productivity . to analyze the effect of fiscal-policy on saving and growth , we modified the original-model to include a set of relationships that describe the federal-budget and its links to the economy , using the framework of the national-income and product-accounts ( nipa ) . to isolate the effect of changes in saving on growth , we varied the saving-rate while using the same assumptions for the growth in the labor-force and total-factor-productivity . the model is helpful for exploring the long-term-implications of national-saving and fiscal-policy and for comparing-alternative paths within a common economic-framework . since 1992 , gao has provided the congress with a long-term-perspective on alternative fiscal-policy paths.1 the results provide illustrations rather than precise-forecasts of the economic-outcomes associated with alternative-policy or saving-rate-assumptions . the model depicts the links between saving and the economy over the long term and does not reflect their interrelationships during short-term business-cycles . we have made several simplifying-assumptions such as holding-interest-rates and total-factor-productivity growth constant , but sensitivity-analyses suggest that variations in these assumptions generally would not affect the relative-outcomes of alternative-policies . these simulations are not predictions of what will happen in the future as policymakers would likely take action to prevent damaging out-year fiscal and economic-consequences . overview of the model in the model , gdp is determined by the labor-force , capital-stock , and total-factor-productivity . gdp in turn influences nonfederal-saving , which 1see budget-policy : prompt-action necessary to avert long-term-damage to the economy ( gao/ocg-92-2 , june 5 , 1992 ) , the deficit and the economy : an update of long-term-simulations (

private sector and state and local-government surpluses or deficits . through its effects on federal-revenues and spending , gdp also helps determine the nipa federal-budget-surplus or deficit . nonfederal and federal-saving together compose national-saving , which influences investment and the next-period 's capital-stock . capital combines with labor and total-factor-productivity to determine gdp in the next-period , and the process continues . the model allows us to focus on the contribution of national-saving to output and living-standards through the linkage between saving and the capital-stock . in particular , the model provides a useful-framework for assessing the long-term-implications of alternative-budget-policies through their effect on national-saving . our model does not differentiate between tax-policy-changes and spending-changes . the aggregate-effect on the amount of federal government-saving is what affects the level of national-saving and economic growth . federal-surpluses increase national-saving while deficits reduce national-saving , and higher saving-translates into higher gdp . higher gdp in turn lessens the share of the nation's output dedicated to government transfer programs in our modeling because we use a simplifying-assumption that such programs do not simply keep pace with overall economic growth.2 in our simulations , we make the simplifying-assumption that the combined saving-rate of the household , business , and state and local-government-sectors will remain constant throughout the simulation-period at 16.1 percent of gdp-average-nonfederal saving as a share of gdp since 1998.3 future-saving-rates of these sectors will of course vary in response to a variety of influences , such as demographics , expectations , and changes in preferences . nonetheless , this simplifying-assumption allows us to assess the effect of budget-policy on saving , investment , and output in the future . labor-input economic growth is partly dependent on how much-labor is employed . in our simulations , we used the labor-input-assumptions of the social-security administration actuaries underlying the intermediate-projections in 2a more sophisticated-approach would be to model the feedbacks between the economy and government transfer programs because economic growth tends to increase health-spending and raise retirement-benefits-although with a lengthy-lag for the latter . 3the 3-year period coincides with federal-surpluses and its use avoids extending the unusually low-nonfederal saving-rate of 2000 throughout the simulation-period . page 128 gao-01-591sp national-saving total-factor-productivity the 2001 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old-age and survivors-insurance and disability trust-funds . the intermediate-projections , which reflect the trustees ' best estimate , reflect changes in the working-age-population , particularly the increasing-rate of retirement by the baby-boom-generation after 2010 . they also reflect projections of labor-force-participation rates , unemployment-rates , and weekly-hours worked . the demographic and economic-assumptions imply a sharp-drop in the average annual-growth of aggregate-hours worked from 0.7 percent through 2010 to 0.2 percent from 2020 through 2075 . the three sources of economic growth in the model are increased labor-input , capital-accumulation , and the advance of total-factor productivity.4 the latter is a catch-all-category reflecting sources of growth not captured in straightforward-measures of aggregate-labor-input and aggregate physical-capital employed . these include not only the improvements in products and processes yielded by advancing-technology but also the improved-quality of labor and capital-inputs , reallocation of inputs to uses where they are more productive , and improvements in physical and social infrastructure . our simulations assume that total-factor-productivity growth in the nonfarm-business-sector will average 1.5 percent annually over the 75-year period . basically , we used the productivity-assumption underlying cbo 's january 2001 , 10-year budget-projections . in its most recent-long-term modeling report , cbo assumed total-factor-productivity growth of 1.7 percent beyond 2010.5 the intermediate-projections in the 2001 oasdi trustees ' report assume that labor-productivity for the entire-economy will increase 1.5 percent annually over the next 75 years . the trustees ' longterm-assumption reflects the average-labor productivity-growth over the 4the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) publishes an official measure of output per unit of combined labor and capital inputs-multifactor-productivity . bls ' measure of labor-input not only takes into account-changes in the size of the labor-force , but also changes in its composition as measured by education and work-experience . capital-inputs are measured in terms of efficiency or service-flow rather than price or value . for more information on multifactor-productivity , see `` productivity-measure : business-sector and major subsectors , '' bls handbook of methods , bureau of labor statistics ( april 1997 ) , pp . 89-98 ; and edwin r. dean and michael j. harper , `` the bls productivity measurement program , '' bureau of labor statistics ( july 5 , 2000

office ( october 2000 ) . international financial flows last 30 years and would correspond to a lower assumption for total-factor-productivity growth than cbo 's most recent-assumption . our use of cbo 's january 2001 , 10-year assumption for total-factor-productivity growth throughout the 75-year simulation-period places our long-term-assumption between the trustees ' and cbo 's current-long-term assumptions . there are also important-links between national-saving and investment and the international-sector . in an open-economy such as the united states , an increase in saving due to , for example , an increase in the federal-budget-surplus may not result in an equivalent-increase in domestic-investment . instead , part of the increased saving may flow abroad in the form of an increase in u.s. net foreign investment . the income earned on u.s.-owned foreign-assets adds to the nation 's income ( gnp ) . the portion of an increase in national-saving used for domestic-investment adds to the capital-stock available for workers to produce goods and services in the united states ( gdp ) . the model incorporates a simple-representation of net financial flows between the u.s. economy and the rest of the world . essentially the rest of the world is treated as analogous to a bank where the united states can make deposits or withdrawals or draw on a credit-line . every year there are income-flows to or from this bank corresponding to interest received on deposits or paid on advances . the amount corresponding to the bank-balance ( positive or negative ) is called the net international-investment-position ( niip ) of the united states , which generates a net-flow of income-receipts . a key-model-assumption affecting international-flows is the allocation of gross-saving between its foreign and domestic-investment uses . over the long run , we assume that market-forces such as adjustments in exchange rates , interest rates , and prices will tend to move net foreign investment and the current-account-balance towards zero . to reflect this tendency to move towards equilibrium , we hold net foreign investment constant at the nominal-dollar level in 2000 . this reduces the ratio of net foreign investment to gdp over time as gdp grows . changes in national-saving cause the ratio of net foreign investment to gdp to move around its longterm-trend . we assume that net foreign investment rises by one-third of any increase in the national-saving-rate . basically , for each additional-dollar saved , about 66.6 cents are used for domestic-investment and 33.3 cents are invested abroad . conversely , each dollar-decrease in national-saving is offset by 33.3 cents in foreign investment in the united states . our budget and other assumptions assumption is consistent with the strong-correlation between national-saving and domestic-investment that persists even in the context of a global 6 economy . this is a highly stylized representation of the foreign-sector of one country in isolation . a more sophisticated-approach would be to model a changing international-environment in detail . a more detailed-approach would confront major-uncertainties concerning the actual-course of world economic development , exchange rates , and rates of return . table ii.1 lists the key-assumptions incorporated in the model . several of the assumptions used tend to provide conservative estimates of the benefit of running-surpluses or lower deficits and of the harm of increasing-deficits . the interest rate on the national-debt is held constant , for example , even when deficits climb and the national-saving-rate plummets . under such conditions , the more likely-result would be a rise in the rate of interest and a more rapid-increase in federal-interest-payments than our simulations display . another conservative-assumption is that the rate of total-factor-productivity growth is unaffected by the amount of investment . productivity is assumed to advance 1.5 percent each year through the end of the simulation-period even if investment-collapses . finally , one-third of any saving-decline is assumed to be offset by net-inflows of foreign-capital , even in the event of a dramatic saving-decline that might set off a flight of capital from the united states . such assumptions tend to moderate the effect of changes in national-saving in our simulations . sensitivity-analyses reveal that variations in these assumptions generally would not affect the relative-outcomes of alternative-policies .

11 the long-term medicaid spending-path reflects cbo 's october 2000 long-term projections.12 we assume that current-law-benefits are paid in full even after the projected exhaustion of the oasdi and hi trust-funds . other mandatory-spending is a residual-category consisting of all non-social-security , nonhealth mandatory-spending . it is equivalent to cbo 's nipa projection for transfers , grants , and subsidies less health , oasdi , and other discretionary-spending . through 2010 , cbo assumptions are the main-determinant of other mandatory-spending , after which it grows at the same rate as gdp . in our save the unified-surpluses base-simulation , receipts follow cbo 's dollar-projections through 2010 . thereafter , receipts remain at 20.2 percent of gao 's simulated gdp on a nipa-basis , which is the rate that cbo projects for 2010 . on a unified-budget basis , revenues remain at 20.4 percent of gdp after 2010 . 9if spending were to keep pace with population-growth and inflation over the long term , discretionary-spending would generally grow slower than the economy and the long-term-budget surplus/deficit would be improved . for example , see analytical-perspectives , budget of the united states government : fiscal year 2001 , executive office of the president , office of management and budget ( february 2000 ) , pp . 30-31 . 10the 2001 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old-age and survivors-insurance and disability insurance trust-funds ( march 2001 ) . 11the 2001 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal supplementary medical-insurance trust-fund ( march 2001 ) and the 2001 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal hospital-insurance trust-fund ( march 2001 ) . 12cbo 's long-term-health-care cost-growth-assumptions are generally-consistent with those in the 2001 medicare trustees' reports . both cbo and the medicare trustees generally assume per-beneficiary-costs to grow at gdp per capita plus 1-percentage-point over the long-term . see the long-term-budget outlook , congressional budget office ( october 2000 ) and the 2001 hi and smi trustees reports . our interest-rate-assumption for 2000 through 2005 is consistent with the average-rate on the debt held by the public implied by cbo 's interest-payment-projections in its baseline . to avoid the substantial-volatility in the implied interest rate after 2005 as a result of declining-debt , interest rates are held constant at 5.4 percent-the average-interest-rate assumed by cbo on short- and long-term treasury securities-from 2005 through the end of the simulation-period . this interest rate is both paid on outstanding-debt held by the public and earned on nonfederal financial-assets acquired by the government once debt held by the public is eliminated.13 our simulation period-from 2000 through 2075-coincides with the 75year-period used for the social-security trustees ' report where actuaries calculate trust-fund-solvency over a long-term-horizon that is at least as long as an individual 's working-life . because our model-assumptions are based on current-budget projections and recent-long-term actuarial-projections for social-security and medicare , our current-model-assumptions differ somewhat from those used in our earlier reports . also , these simulations reflect discretionary-spending growing with inflation after 2001 ; in our earlier reports , discretionary-spending was assumed to comply with statutory-caps in effect through 2002 . as a result , these simulation-results should not be compared directly to those in our earlier reports . 13under this interest-rate-assumption , the level of net-interest payments and net-debt would be the same if the government began acquiring nonfederal financial-assets before debt held by the public was eliminated . page 134 gao-01-591sp national-saving appendix iii glossary wealth-effect the change in consumption and saving associated with a change in wealth . for example , households may consume more ( or save less ) in response to their greater wealth due to rising stock or housing-values . appendix iv bibliography alexander , arthur j . `` japan 's economy in the 20th century .
