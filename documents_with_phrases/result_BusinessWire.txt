business wire state 's poor to lose $ 2 million in legal-aid wednesday , november 13 , 2002 detroit- ( business wire ) -nov. 13 , 2002-michigan will lose $ 2 million in federal-funding and $ 600,000 in state-funding to provide legal-aid to the poor in 2003 , according to deierdre l. weir , executive director of the legal-aid and defender association , inc. , the state 's largest provider of legal-services to the poor . current federal-funds of nearly $ 10.7 million from the legal-services corporation ( lsc ) will drop to $ 8.7 million for next year , according to weir . she said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty , according to the u.s. census-bureau 's 2000 census . lsc uses census-data to determine funding across the nation , and according to the census , the state 's poverty-population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000 . the state 's legal-aid-agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some $ 600,000 of state-funding . a portion of filing-fees paid by litigants in the state 's circuit-courts , and a portion of interest on lawyers-trust-accounts ( iolta ) are earmarked for michigan legal-aid-programs . these funds are expected to drop from currently $ 7.5 million in 2002 to $ 6.9 million when the michigan state-bar foundation makes distributions next year . most of the decrease is attributed to the past year 's low-interest-rates . `` the irony of these funding-cuts is that while there may be fewer poor-people in michigan today , the demand for service will not change because the poverty-population remains so large and the legal-aid-funding so little that local-providers will never able to serve all who need our service , '' said weir . `` it 's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding-cuts . '' the u.s. census-bureau , in spite of its best efforts , can not locate every poor-person living in a census-tract , therefore the poor are also undercounted , added weir . the brunt of these cuts will be felt most in wayne county where according to the census some 333,000 poor-people live , the largest concentration of poverty in the state . lad will lose more than $ 870,000 for legal-aid in wayne county , nearly-half of the state's total-loss , said weir . while difficult to measure , the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of michigan 's poor in need of legal-service will not receive it , or they will receive significantly limited service . cutbacks will include service in such civil legal-matters as landlord-tenant , bankruptcy , consumer , child-custody , predatory-lending , mortgage-foreclosure , utility-shutoffs , social-security , wills , and probate . `` local-providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much-service as we can with fewer dollars , '' said weir . `` we will be providing more selfhelp-training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal-system on their own in routine-matters , more assistance on the telephone , and less direct-representation by attorneys in specific , high impact-matters . currently , michigan has 13 legal-aid-agencies covering the state 's 83 counties . eight receive lsc-funding in addition to receiving charitable-gifts and grants from various local supporters . most of the eight providers rely on lsc-funding for at least 40 percent of their annual-operating-budgets . some of these providers have already laid off attorneys and support-staff in anticipation of next year 's reduced-funding , according to weir . weir added that the legal-aid-agencies will also recruit more attorneys from private-practice to handle legal-aid-cases for free , and accelerate efforts to find alternative-funding . lsc is a private nonprofit-organization established by congress in 1974 to provide legal-services to the poor . last year congress appropriated $ 329 million to lsc to distribute to local-programs across the country and lsc has requested the same amount for 2003 . lsc 's funding-request from congress is essentially-unchanged , says weir , because the poverty-population has decreased in some states such as michigan , but has risen in others , and the number of persons in the u.s. living in poverty has changed little over the past decade . according to the u.s census-bureau , 33.6 million persons in the u.s. were living below poverty-level in 1990 , compared to 31.6 million in 2000 . however , the census-bureau 's adjusted-estimates for 2001 show an increase in poverty nationally . `` the poverty-rate and the number of poor both rose in 2001 , to 11.7 percent and 32.9 million , up from 11.3 percent and 31.6 million , '' states-poverty in the united states : 2001 , a recent-bureau-report . weir says that traditionally lsc-sticks to the 10-year census-data , and will not change its funding based on the 2001 data , however it is possible that lsc will make an adjustment in the future . lad was established in 1909 as the legal-aid society of detroit and today is the largest legal-aid-provider in michigan and one of the largest of its kind in the u.s. with a staff of 80 attorneys and 90-support-staff , the organization provides civil legal-services and criminal-representation of indigent-defendants in both state and federal-courts . lad services more than 15,000 citizens annually . in addition to lsc , lad is funded by united way for southeastern michigan , michigan state-bar foundation , detroit area agency on aging , the senior alliance , city of detroit , wayne county , u.s. department of housing and urban development , administrative office of u.s. courts , and private-donations .
