newsmaker : legal-aid-chief loves challenges by julie anderson world-herald staff writer taking-charge of nebraska 's statewide legal-aid law firm fit doug german 's beliefs in treating-everyone fairly and holding those in power accountable . it also fit with his history of taking on new challenges . over his nearly 60 years , the eustis , neb. , attorney has served in the peace corps in colombia and worked as an advance-man during robert f. kennedy 's run for president . german bought into a coffee-farm in costa rica and later adopted three sisters from that country . and during a short-career as a cornhusker-football-player , he shooed a young tom osborne off a practice-field . but after about a quarter-century in private-practice , he resigned in april 2000 and became executive director of nebraska legal-services . the firm had just been created through the merger of three groups : the legal-aid society of omaha , legal-services of southeast nebraska in lincoln and western legal-services of grand island . since then , he 's logged 60,000 miles between eustis and the firm's seven offices across the state and thrown himself into the firm's effort to see that as many low-income-nebraskans as possible get legal-help . right now , nebraska legal-services , which handles about 95 percent of the state 's legal-aid-cases , figures it reaches only 15 percent of the 211,000 nebraskans eligible by income for its services . that 's about 8,500 cases a year . most of the cases involve family-law - from child-abuse and neglect matters to landlord-tenant-disputes . the group does not handle criminal-cases . based on an american bar-association formula , the firm estimates that nebraska 's low-income-residents will be involved in about 65,000 significant legal-matters this year . those who ca n't afford access to the criminal-justice-system may lose hope or take matters into their own hands , german said . `` i have a fear that we have a generation of people who are coming up not believing in the system , '' german said . `` that 's going to spell problems . '' originally , most legal-aid-work was funded by congress through the legal-services corp. with cuts in federal-funding , local-firms have been pressed to raise more money . federal-funding will make up $ 1.53 million of the nebraska group 's $ 3.9 million budget this year . the rest will come from the nebraska commission on public advocacy , nebraska lawyers ' trust-accounts , individual-donations , grants and contracts . eric kleiman , a spokesman for legal-services corp. in washington , d.c. , said german has been out front nationally in raising-funds and in using new technology , including a statewide-web-site . `` the best program-directors in america are the ones that are able to adjust to the reality of the time , '' kleiman said . german came to nebraska legal-services with a goal of doubling the firm 's capacity to serve . that means raising an additional $ 2.5 million a year . one step toward that goal was a recent-pledge by some of the state 's leading-lawyers to raise up to $ 1 million for the firm over the next three years . other campaigns are under way . in addition , nebraska legal-services is involved in a committee developing a statewide-plan for expanding legal-services for low-income-residents . the legal-profession , german said , has an obligation to provide access to the justice-system because it has taken on the role of gateway to that system . in a sense , german 's new job is n't far from where he started decades ago . after finishing high school in cozad , neb. , german went off to the university of nebraska-lincoln . as a sophomore , the 6-foot-1 , 160-pound quarterback joined the freshman-football-team . it was 1961 , bob devaney 's first year as coach . one day , german was out throwing-passes at an early-practice . people often dropped by asking to run a few plays . one was a skinny redhead . german agreed but told the redhead he 'd better get out of there when the linemen came out . two weeks later , tom osborne , then a graduate-assistant , was one of his coaches . german 's football career was short - he admits he was outclassed - but he still has a copy of devaney 's first playbook . german graduated with a mechanical-engineering-degree in 1965 , then joined the peace corps , spending two years in colombia . back in nebraska , he helped organize part of a whistlestop-tour from cheyenne , wyo. , across nebraska for the robert kennedy campaign . a few weeks later , kennedy was assassinated in california . german moved on to simultaneously earn a law-degree from unl and a master 's degree in regional-planning from the university of pennsylvania . he worked for a legal-aid-firm in lincoln and briefly ran a legal-clinic with two friends . then he went into private-practice in cozad . in 1979 , he stopped at a lexington clothing-store to buy cowboy boots . a friend persuaded him to see a coffee-farm in costa rica , mostly as a fun-trip . german and two partners still own the 60-acre farm . he and his wife , connie koch , own the jose bravo coffee co. , which buys and markets-part of the 40,000 pounds of environmentally-friendly coffee the farm produces each year . koch owns the eustis pool hall , a local-landmark and restaurant , and the hotel eustis . german and koch adopted three sisters from costa rica not long after their marriage in 1985 . years before in colombia , german had looked into the eyes of poor-children and told himself he 'd help if he was ever in a position to do so . the two oldest sisters are married and have their own children . the youngest attends classes and is a standout-point-guard at eustis-farnam high school . german-knows , because he goes to her games . german , who also plays basketball , wants to make sure his new firm 's employees have an opportunity for family-time while doing good-work . the staff is driven by reasons other than money , he said , and the firm employs some of the area 's best attorneys in their fields . `` we will be known , if we 're not already , as an outstanding-law firm .
