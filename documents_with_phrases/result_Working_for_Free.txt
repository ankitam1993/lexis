working for free pays off for caring lawyer bruce zucker chooses to provide pro-bono legal-aid to poor tenants over more prestigious-work , and it has become his life's passion . karima a. haynes sunday , january 5 , 2003 nothing in bruce zucker 's upbringing seems to have prepared him for his life 's work defending the poor . a tall , athletic-man who favors pleated-khakis and starched button-down-shirts , zucker grew up in an upper-middle-class-enclave in the west san fernando valley , far from the poverty he now sees every day . at taft high school and ucla , zucker said , the closest brush with poverty was reading-newspaper-articles about unscrupulous bosses withholding-wages from garment-district-workers . before graduating from loyola law-school in 1993 , zucker interviewed with a prestigious santa monica law firm and deftly matched wits with the partners over lunch at an upscale-restaurant . yet as he chatted amiably with the partners , something was n't quite right . `` i just did n't get the impression that they were really-happy , '' zucker said . `` they seemed to be more passionate about their weekend plans than the work they were doing . '' after the meeting , zucker realized he had to ask himself some fundamental-questions . what was his life 's passion ? what work would be so satisfying that he 'd do it for free ? he found the answer as he recalled his schooling . zucker remembered the elation he felt in law-school , when he helped resolve a landlord-tenant-dispute while volunteering at a legal-aid-program . `` there was no big , dramatic-event in my childhood that made me want to help poor-people , '' zucker said . `` but it does n't take a bleeding-heart-liberal to rally behind a cause and do the right-thing . '' today , zucker has dedicated his career to helping poor-people gain access to quality legal-representation . he is a full-time business-law-professor at cal state northridge , where in 1998 he founded the justice-center , a hands-on-program where students earn course-credit by helping-low-income people with landlord-tenant-disputes . through the center , about 30 indigent-clients a year receive free legal-help , ranging from filling out documents to receiving-representation in court . the 35-year-old northridge-resident also serves as supervising-attorney at the van nuys self-help legal access center , a two-room office in a prefabricated-building in the shadow of the van nuys courthouse where the impoverished go to resolve all manner of legal-problems . on a recent-morning at the center , a lawyer dispensed-advice in spanish about divorce-proceedings to a dozen-people seated around a conference-table . a law-student and a client huddled over a stack of papers . and two female-volunteers tended to people at a counter while other clients sat at computers downloading-forms from the internet . zucker , who volunteers at the center several days a week , was recently honored for volunteering more than 150 hours in free legal-services to the poor -- more than three times the time donated by most practicing-attorneys , he said . the state-bar of california presented zucker with its 2002 president 's pro-bono-service award for his volunteer-work with tenants ' rights-issues . the award was established in 1983 to give statewide-recognition to attorneys for providing pro-bono legal-services to the poor . zucker was nominated by the van nuys center and the ventura county superior court , where he has served as a temporary-judge in small-claims-court and has volunteered with a court-sponsored program for at-risk high school-students . being acknowledged by his peers was a thrill , zucker said , but his greatest honor comes from earning-praise from his students . `` professor zucker is a huge-advocate for the little-man , '' said nicole blackman , 21 , a senior-business-major at cal state northridge . `` he is one of those people who wants to see good-things happen to good-people . '' the toughest challenge in defending the poor is focusing on a case 's merits and not on a client 's circumstances , zucker said . `` i am a lawyer , and my job is to protect the interests of my client , but some cases do n't have merit and i have to let them go , '' he said . `` i do n't take every case , but i take the clients seriously . '' on a recent-morning at the legal access center , zucker sat at a small-table with jacqueline green , 41 , of north hollywood . the single-mother was trying to avoid being evicted . `` he is treating me like gold , '' green said . `` he is a kind , nice-hearted-man . he does n't care if you are on public-assistance : he 's willing to help . '' although he is doing what he loves most , zucker said , at times , he gets worn down by his clients ' overwhelming-poverty . to relieve the burden , he frequently goes for long drives or talks-shop with his wife , kiren dosanjh , also an attorney and cal state northridge professor . looking back , zucker said he does n't regret his decision to dedicate his career to defending the poor . `` someone once said , 'get a job you love , and you 'll never work a day in your life , ' `` zucker said . `` i believe it 's more important to get a job you are happy with and let things flow from there .
