mobile-home residents sue city for loss , moving-costs wednesday , may 29 , 2002 by jan ackerman , post-gazette staff writer residents and former-residents of a lincoln place mobile-home-park that is being demolished to make way for a city-owned community-center are demanding that the government compensate them for lost trailers and relocation-costs . on friday , a group of residents filed a lawsuit against pittsburgh , seeking-damages for families who were displaced and sometimes forced to abandon their mobile-homes because they could n't afford to move them . the lawsuit , filed by attorneys for neighborhood legal-services association and community justice project , asked the allegheny county courts to appoint a board of viewers under the state eminent-domain-code to determine `` just compensation and relocation expenses '' for five families who still live there and for several who already were evicted . the city has offered $ 700,000 for the 7.2-acre site , which edward j. raimondi jr. of munhall bought for $ 500,000 in july 2000 . the city plans to build a community-center for lincoln place and a future-fire-station on the site . raimondi has been evicting-residents and demolishing-trailers that are left behind in order to meet a city-requirement that he present a clean-piece of land with no environmental-concerns . in the suit , nls attorney eileen d. yacknin and evalynn b. welling , community justice project attorney , contend that the city is trying to avoid its responsibilities to the tenants under state eminent-domain-code and the federal housing and community-development act by having raimondi carry out the evictions . the attorneys contended that the city has an obligation to pay the tenants for damages they have sustained by being evicted for property that will be used for a public-purpose . `` many of them were compelled to abandon the mobile-homes they had owned for years , because they lacked the financial-resources -- typically $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 -- which would have been required to move their homes from the property , '' yacknin wrote . yesterday , deputy mayor sal sirabella said he had not seen the lawsuit . he said the city still maintains that the residents of the mobile-home-park must seek any compensation from raimondi , not from the city . `` our agreement of sale is with mr. raimondi , and the issues between him and the former-tenants are his to resolve , '' said sirabella . `` i believe we have a sales-agreement that has been signed , '' sirabella said , adding that no closing-date has been set . one of the plaintiffs , joan tate , who is disabled , was forced to move into a federally subsidized rental-housing in may because of '' increasingly uninhabitable-conditions in the park , '' the suit said . tate , who receives less than $ 600 a month from supplemental social-security , could not afford to pay several thousand dollars to relocate her mobile-home , which was appraised at $ 2,500 . as soon as she moved out , the mobile-home was demolished , the suit said .
