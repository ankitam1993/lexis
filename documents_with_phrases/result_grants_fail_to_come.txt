legal-aid forced to raise rates hoped-for-grants fail to come through for busy-firm mon , june 10 , 2002 by tim gurrister standard-examiner-staff ogden -- for most lawyers , full waiting-rooms and appointments booked out to mid-july would equate to a lucrative-law practice . but frank smith drives a 6-year-old car with 140,000 miles on it , and paying his senior paralegal-minimum-wage the last few months has put him in the red . hoped-for federal-grants-haven '' t come through , so he '' s had to raise his rates . as of last week he charges $ 50 an hour-minimum instead of $ 25 for the services of his yearling northern utah legal-aid foundation . that '' s in a lawyer '' s market where fees range in the $ 150 to $ 250 an hour-range in the ogden area , and up to $ 400 an hour in the salt lake area . smith '' s one-lawyer foundation basically helps the folks who have too much money to qualify for the federally funded utah legal-services , but not enough-money to afford a lawyer . public-interest-law '' it '' s public-interest-law , '' smith said . `` i wouldn '' t be doing it if i didn '' t enjoy it . you can take a case just on its merits . `` it '' s very personally satisfying to do good legal-work without having to worry about getting paid . `` that '' s a luxury-lawyers don '' t usually have . '' smith headed the ogden-office of utah legal-services for nine years , leaving about a year ago over a dispute with management in salt lake . the departure left him free to open his own discount-law shop at 2485 grant ave. his `` work in progress , '' as he calls it , mirrors the no-fee legal-services guidelines . he uses the same federal-poverty-guidelines to determine his hourly-rate , which tops out at $ 87.50 . a big-part of smith '' s clientele comes from referrals from his old job . his client base is all referrals , since he doesn '' t advertise . if he did advertise , his volunteer , 45-hours-a-week office manager jody smith , no relation , says she might kill him . `` swimming upstream '' '' we '' re-swimming upstream big-time here , '' she said . the office opens at 9 a.m. , and rarely closes before 6 p.m. , with 7:30 the norm , and 9 p.m. not unusual . `` we close when we get to close , '' she said . `` and then he ( frank ) will come in on saturdays and sundays to catch up on paperwork . my husband bob is totally-supportive , or i couldn '' t do this . '' pro-bono help needed with the $ 80,000 in grant-funds he was trying for , smith had thought of hiring a lawyer , and paying jody . frank smith won '' t say it , but jody will mention her disappointment at how few lawyers volunteer to help the foundation by taking some cases pro-bono , without fee . `` we get a lot of that , '' she said , noting that so far only lavar '' bud '' stark is pitching in . `` i have not asked other attorneys to handle cases , so i haven '' t been turned down , '' frank smith said . `` so i can '' t say i '' m disappointed . not yet . he '' s planning to take a formal-proposal to one of the monthly-meetings of the weber county-bar-association this summer . he '' ll be asking all the lawyers who refer penniless-clients to him , to set up a fee-schedule like his , so he can refer his overflow to them . one of the most recent local-lawyers to `` pledge '' as jody smith calls it , is kent snider . `` he '' s fabulous , '' snider says of frank smith . `` he '' s too modest . there '' s a huge need he '' s trying to fill . '' it '' s endemic to the entire-profession , snider said : `` basically if you '' re rich , you can hire lawyers , and if you '' re poor , you can have one appointed . `` anything in between , you '' re screwed . basically the general-public can '' t afford appropriate legal-services . '' family-law a priority the biggest part of the foundation '' s work is family-law : divorce , custody , child-support , etc . in the midst of his custody-fight , chris barboza , ogden , heard about smith from the friend of a friend two months ago . `` if someone trusts their children with an attorney , i '' ve got to get that attorney , '' he said . he '' d used up $ 900 on his prior-attorney , a lot of it blown on four failed-attempts to get his exwife served with adoption-papers . she died before that could happen while hospitalized with a chronic ailment . `` i couldn '' t get anything done with the other lawyer without more money . `` it was kind of a little-miracle that i got hold of frank , '' barboza said . `` he didn '' t sit there rubbing his head wondering what to do like these other lawyers . he just said . 'it looks like a tough-fight . let '' s get it on , ' and went right to work . '' praise for smith an ogden-man , who has been in a custody-fight with his ex-wife for more than two years over visitation of a 3-year-old daughter in sanpete county he hasn '' t seen since she was 8 months old , also had praise for smith . the man '' s-experience had left him bitter about the legal-system , since he wasn '' t able to retain a lawyer . `` a lawyer of any kind would help , otherwise they assume you '' re a deadbeat , '' the man said . smith was able to hook him up with a pro-bono lawyer in sanpete county , unable to take the case himself , since his range of practice is from logan to bountiful . `` he '' s a good-guy . he '' s trying to help a lot of people , but he '' s overwhelmed , '' the ogden father said . `` frank was referred to me by the guy who was referred to me by another guy . '' `` you wonder what you '' re going to be when you grow up , '' lawyer smith said . `` hopefully along the way you find something you enjoy . this type of law suits me . `` i don '' t know why . who knows . i just get personal-satisfaction out of this .
