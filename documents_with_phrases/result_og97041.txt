'' likewise , 42 u.s.c . § 11023 ( b ) ( 2 ) provides that the `` administrator on his own motion or at the request of a governor of a state . . . may apply the requirements of this section to . . . any particular-facility that manufactures , processes , or otherwise uses '' a listed toxic-chemical under the conditions stated in the statute . 2a detailed-discussion of tri is available at epa 's internet-site -- http : //www.epa.gov/opptintr/tri/ . page 2 gao/ogc-97-41 enclosure i analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the environmental-protection agency entitled `` addition of facilities in certain-industry-sectors ; revised interpretation of otherwise-use ; toxic release inventory ; community right-to-know '' ( rin : 2070-ac71 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the epa has included a detailed economic-analysis in its submission to gao , setting forth and assessing the costs , benefits , and associated impacts of the rule . the preamble to the rule contains summaries of the aforementioned-assessments . included in the analysis is what can best be described as the social-impact and costs of toxic-chemical-releases and other waste-management activities and the value of the information to society that will be available from the reports from the industries added by the rule . epa also has concluded that although there is some overlap between other reporting-requirements for environmental-releases and other management-activities mandated by epcra , ppa , and other statutes , the reporting-requirements of this rule do not conflict because of the differences in information collected , entities covered , reporting-frequencies , how the data are reported , and so forth . the analysis indicates that 6,300 firms submitting 42,500 reports annually will be added by the rule to the 360 facilities in the existing-manufacturing-sector submitting 3,600 reports for a total-compliance-cost of $ 226 million for the first year , declining to $ 143 million in subsequent-years . the difference in cost for the first and subsequent-years appears to be based on epa 's estimate that each task required including-compliance-determinations for the new facilities covered , the overall-affect of the modified interpretation of `` otherwise-use , '' rule-familiarization , and report preparation will be substantially higher during the first year . benefits are not monetarily quantified because of the lack of any existing-methodology to do so . epa notes that the benefits to be derived are basically those to be achieved directly through the knowledge about the use and disposition of toxic-chemicals and the changes in behavior that may result from the information reported to the tri . gao/ogc-97-41 ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 section 603 - initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis epa published the initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis ( irfa ) as required by § 603 . 61 fed . reg . 33612 , june 27 , 1996 . the irfa explained that it defined small business as any firm having 10-49 employees rather than the under 500-employee-criteria used by the sba . using this criteria the agency estimated that 4,600 of the 6,400 firms affected by the rule would be small businesses and that approximately 15,000 small-entities in the industry-groups affected by the proposed-rule would not be affected as they employed less than 10 persons . the irfa also considered various-alternatives to the proposed-rule , including different-reporting-requirements and reporting-thresholds . section 604 - final regulatory-flexibility-analysis epa analyzed the potential-impact on small-entities by the standard industrial classification ( sic ) code and concluded that there would not be a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . nonetheless , the agency prepared an extensive-analysis of the impact on small-entities . this assessment is based on an estimate of 4,800 businesses that will be affected , 3,600 of which can be categorized as small by sba sic code . epa's analysis indicates that the first year , 60 percent ( 2,895 ) of the small-entities will expend less than 1 percent of their annual revenue for the rule 's compliance-costs , 12 percent ( 569 ) will expend between 1 percent and 3 percent , and 119 or 2 percent will expend 3 percent or more of their annual-revenues for compliance . these figures drop significantly during the second and ensuing years , e.g. , 70 percent ( 3,353 ) less than 1 percent , 4 percent ( 171 ) between 1 percent and 3 percent , and only 59 or 1 percent with an economic-impact of 3 percent or greater . epa also estimates that 49 public-utilities owned by 41 municipalities will be affected by the rule , and of that total , the 18 small-governmental entities ( populations under 50,000 ) affected will expend less than 1 percent of their annual-revenues for compliance . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 the epa has included an unfunded-mandates reform act statement with its report to this office . that statement declares that the rule will not result in expenditure to state , local , or tribal governments3 in the aggregate of $ 100 million or more in 3the entities affected are 49 publically owned electric-utilities with combined annual-expenditures estimated by epa to be $ 2,065,000 the first year and $ 1,342,000 thereafter . page 2 gao/ogc-97-41 any year , but that the rule `` may '' result in private-sector-expenditures of $ 100 million or more annually ( $ 226 million the first year and $ 143 million thereafter ) . the epa avers that it has not identified any sources of federal financial-assistance to defray the state , local , or tribal-expenditures under the rule or other federal-resources available to carry out the intergovernmental-mandate included in the rule . epa claims that because the expenditures by publically owned electric-utilities are so modest the rule does not impose a `` significant '' federal intergovernmental-mandate . in any event , epa claims to have '' engaged in a number of efforts to consult with other units of government '' as described in the proposed-rule , 61 fed . reg . 33587 at 33615 , and that it received and considered comments on the issue as discussed in the preamble to the final-rule , 62 fed . reg . 23834 at 23864 . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rules were promulgated using the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . a notice of proposed-rulemaking was published on june 27 , 1996 , 61 fed . reg . 33587 , and comments were requested . epa initially provided for a 60-day comment-period but then granted an additional 30 days for comments from interested parties . epa received 2,715 comments4 at the close of the public-comment-period on september 25 , 1996 . comments were considered and discussed in the preamble . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule contains information-collection-requirements which are subject to the paperwork reduction act . epa submitted the requirements to omb which approved them as an extension of the currently approved information-requirements . omb approved the requirements as an addendum to the icr approved under omb control no . 2070-0093 . the omb control-number for this action is 2070-0157 . statutory-authorization for the rule the epa cites sections 313 ( b ) and 328 of the emergency-planning and community right-to-know act of 1986 ( epcra ) , 42 u.s.c . §§11023 ( b ) and 11048 as the statutory-authority for the issuance of this rule . . 4industry provided 470 comments , 86 were received from trade-associations , 60 from environmental-groups , 1,875 from private-citizens , 5 from other federal-agencies , 60 from state-agencies , 108 from public-interest-groups , 18 from labor-groups , 14 from universities , and 36 from associations . page 3 gao/ogc-97-41 executive-order no . 12866 the omb reviewed the rule under executive-order no . 12866 as a '' significant regulatory-action . '' the agency reports that any substantive-comments or changes made during the review have been incorporated into the final-rule . page 4 gao/ogc-97-41
