legal-aid to highlight senior-day richard ingham '' but it 's like trying to tell a stranger about rock 'n' roll . '' -john sebastian it 's just this hard when i try to answer the question : why do older oklahomans need lawyers ? the answers are important enough that they will be a discussion-topic of this year 's senior-day at 9 a.m. march 25 in the house chamber at the capitol . the following is a preview of some of the answers for review : we can all agree that older oklahomans need medical care . but even the best care is worthless if an older patient ca n't drive to the doctor for ongoing-treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt-dispute . therefore , lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 oklahomans age 60 and older . another example : if a doctor treats an elderly-patient for a lung-ailment , the doctor 's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again , if the patient is sent home to an unheated-apartment . lawyers know how to make landlords-heat apartments so the medical-treatment can stick . ( by the way , a may 16 , 2001 , article in the new york times reports on a program at boston medical-center providing a walk-in legal-clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients ' legal and administrative battles . ) we also can agree that older oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal-document or process . `` old '' is not a legal-classification that results in automatic-loss of these rights . moreover , having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents ' health-care-choices . it follows that an important-role-lawyers provide for aging oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring-documents such as durable-powers of attorney and guardianship-orders , but also to monitor their use . in family-situations , for example , lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing-rights . they are not to be used to help a family `` manage '' their mother or help a doctor or nursing-home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient . good news : oklahoma now has a public guardianship program , albeit unfunded , that will supply-lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring-process oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren , not raise them . but owing to the social-problems of divorce and drug-use , grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing-parents . adding to the physical , emotional and financial-burden they take on , grandparents face legal-problems . all the decisions-parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal-authority when made by grandparents . grandparents ca n't get shots for their grandchildren , enroll them in school or sign field-trip-permission slips unless they can prove by legal-document that rights that lie naturally in the parents have been transferred to them . this requires lawyers to help grandparents with durable-powers of attorney , guardianships , custody and sometimes-adoption . lawyers are also needed to make the system-work . our judicial-system works well only when both sides have lawyers . effective-representation should not be an accident of geography , economic status or age . the attorneys needed to meet these challenges now are being supplied in part by legal-aid-services of oklahoma ( laso ) under contract with 11-area-agencies on aging covering the state . these services , subject to certain-limitations on types of cases , are free to those 60 and older . to help put a face on the legal-needs of older oklahomans , each person attending senior-day on march 25 will receive a compilation of more than 50 stories written by laso attorneys and paralegals about how they have improved the lives of older oklahomans . richard ingham , state legal-services-developer , can be reached at 522-3069 or mailto : richard.ingham @ okdhs.org
