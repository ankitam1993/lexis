organizations are like elephants -- slow to change james a. belasco over the last ten years , many civil legal-services-leaders , stakeholders , program-directors and managers throughout the united states began to wonder whether the civil legal-services-delivery structure that had been in place for a quarter of a century was positioned to meets its many future-challenges . funding was declining or stagnant , many people in leadership-positions were weary after years of fighting for survival , demand for the delivery of quality legal-services was increasing , staff were questioning their work-environments and their personal-goals , technology was fundamentally changing the practice of law , and society was growing increasingly-inhospitable to the needs of poor-people . the legal-services-delivery system , created in another time and place , didn't seem to be working in the ways that we -- stakeholders , staff , clients -- expected it to work . and although we were proud of our collective-past , many of us had serious-doubts as to whether the delivery-system that we had created , and that had performed well for us and for our clients for the past twenty years , was the most effective and efficient-delivery-system for the difficult and challenging-times ahead . programs and program-directors responded to these concerns in different ways . some pursued strategic-planning-initiatives . others engaged in aggressive-resource-development , pursued-alternative methods of providing legal-services to clients , reconfigured their organizations , or , in some instances , took their skills and talents elsewhere . and , unfortunately , too many of us did nothing . in 1995 and again in 1998 , the legal-services corporation recognized that legal-services-programs were going to have to change the method and manner in which they conducted their business if they were going to remain viable and responsive to the needs of low-income-persons . moreover , lsc wanted to encourage all programs to pursue some semblance of planning . lsc , therefore , required its grantees to begin to examine , on a statewide-level , how all grantees in a particular-state would serve in the present , and plan to serve in the future , the civil legal-needs of low-income-persons . in 1995 , lsc 's state-planning-initiative was primarily focused on how grantees would work together to address funding-shortfalls and to respond to the 1995-96 restrictions . in 1998 , lsc program-letters 98-1 and 98-6 broadened the scope of the state-planning-initiative , asking-grantees to determine how they could expand services and ensure that all clients received similar-levels of assistance regardless of their location in the state or other factors such as language , disability or political-popularity . in essence , these two program-letters asked-grantees to expand their horizons from `` what 's best for the clients in my service-area '' to `` what 's best for clients throughout the state . '' programs were requested to develop plans to coordinate and integrate their work in seven important-areas -- enhancing-client-access and efficiency in delivering high quality legal-assistance ; using-technology to expand access and enhance services ; promoting-client self-help and preventive legal-education and advice ; coordinating legal-work and training ; collaborating with the private-bar ; expanding-resources to support legal-services ; and designing a system-configuration that enhances client-services , reduces barriers and operates efficiently and effectively . lsc 's grantees were asked to : • investigate the strengths and weaknesses of and resources available to individual-programs as well as the overall-strengths and weaknesses of and resources available to the state 's legal-services `` system ; '' • assess the needs of the communities served by the programs and the overall `` system ; '' • anticipate changes and trends that will most likely affect civil legal-services-programs in coming years ; and • devise a plan of action , on a statewide-basis , to address the identified needs of low-income-persons in the present while ensuring that the civil legal-needs of future-generations of low-income-persons can be efficiently and effectively addressed . a handful of states answered lsc 's call to action . they consolidated-programs to increase efficiency and deploy-resources more effectively ; they took advantage of technology-advances to improve intake-systems ; they expanded the network of stakeholders to increase the support and guidance available to service providers . their successes inspired lsc and other national-organizations to a deeper involvement in state-planning and higher expectations for all states . in january 2000 , the lsc board of directors approved lsc's 5-year strategic-direction plan . this document commits lsc to dramatically expand the impact of legal-services-programs throughout the nation by improving-access to legal-services among eligible-persons while enhancing the quality of the services delivered . the plan highlights lsc 's state-planning-initiative as the primary-strategy for achieving these goals . in december 2000 , lsc issued its third-program-letter on state-planning . program-letter 2000-7 renewed lsc 's challenge to its grantees to actively engage in assessing their delivery-practices and policies and the allocation of their legal-services-dollars . program-letter 2000-7 makes clear that the state-planning-initiative will continue to be lsc 's highest priority . what does lsc mean when it talks about state-planning ? it has often been pointed out that the term-state-planning does not capture the full-scope of the activities that are included in the process as it is playing out across the country . developing a plan is only the beginning of an ongoing-effort that includes implementation of the plan 's initiatives , continuous-outreach to new partners , regular-assessment of progress toward goals , and modifications of the plan as circumstances change . because these elements are all included in the concept of strategic-planning , as it is currently understood in management practice , one advantage of the term-state-planning is that it emphasizes that what is involved is strategic-planning for state equal-justice-communities . developing-structures and processes for building and maintaining comprehensive , integrated , statewide civil legal-assistance delivery-systems may define the process more accurately but it is certainly a mouthful . building-state-justice communities captures the concepts of partnership and shared-responsibility that are involved , but may under-emphasize the ultimate-goal to which the building of the community is directed -- the creation and maintenance of a system capable of providing equal-justice for low-income-people . in the end , actions do speak louder than words . it doesn't really matter if we talk about state-planning or state-justice-communities or worldclass-delivery-systems or the creation of comprehensive , integrated and coordinated legal-services-delivery systems . it just matters that we do it . in this report , however , the term-state-planning should be understood in its broadest sense , as inclusive of all these concepts and various-structures , processes , and individual-initiatives described in the following-sections . one final-thought . although state-planning is lsc 's highest priority and we have put considerable-resources into it over the last three years , lsc did not embark upon this journey alone . as we proceeded with state-planning-activities , our national-partners also introduced-projects targeted to the same goals -- the creation in every state of a `` state-justice-community '' collaborating on the creation and maintenance of a civil legal-assistance-system fully-responsive to the needs of low-income-people . among these initiatives we would like to specifically recognize are the joint aba-nlada span ( state-planning assistance network ) project , and the joint nlada-clasp project for the future of equal-justice . on the state-level , iolta -- based funders including but not limited to iolta-programs in ohio , florida , pennsylvania , texas , virginia , new york , new jersey and michigan -- have also been a key-force in state-planning . this report describes progress that the legal-services-community has made in the six years since lsc issued its first program-letter on the subject . it identifies some lessons gleaned from these achievements , describes the growth in selected-states toward building a justice-community capable of responding to the full-range of civil legal-needs of low-income-people ( part ii ) , and identifies some lessons that have emerged from successful or promising-planning-processes , as well as the particular-structures and strategies that these states have employed ( part iii ) . we acknowledge the hard-work of building-state-justice communities and salute all those who have rolled up their sleeves to take part in this exciting-effort . we believe this report demonstrates there is a big-payoff for clients -- which , after all , is what it is all about . over the past six years , many states have developed a range of initiatives aimed at expanding-access and improving-services to clients . their achievements , like the planning-processes they have followed , have varied according to local-circumstances , challenges , and opportunities . as expected , one size truly does not fit all . however , there have been important-similarities in terms of successes . these include : • obtaining or significantly expanding-state-funding for legal-services ; • establishing-systems for coordinating-advocacy and training among programs ; • making the court-system more responsive and accessible to low-income and pro se litigants ; • reconfiguring-programs within a state to strengthen coordination , access , and services ; • establishing-structures to more creatively involve the private-bar in the delivery of civil legal-assistance ; • creating and executing a statewide-technology-plan to improve access and enhance delivery ; • developing a statewide coordinated intake-system ; and • expanding the number of stakeholders within a state committed to the concept of equal-justice . this section describes the progress that has taken place in 18 selected-states toward building-state-justice communities capable of responding to the civil legal-needs of their low-income-residents . these states are at different-stages in the planning-process . in a few states , a fully developed state-justice-community is in place and its accomplishments are paying off in terms of expanded and improved-services to clients . some states have developed key justice-community institutions whose significant-improvements in the structure of civil legal-assistance in their state-position them to make real-changes for clients . some states are still in an early-phase : they have developed a plan that shows real-promise and are just beginning to build the structures and launch the initiatives to implement it . the states described here are by no means the only ones that have made progress . others could have been included as well . some states , such as connecticut , vermont , and hawaii , made major-changes in their delivery-systems in 1995 and 1996 and are working diligently to realize the full-potential of those systems . others , such as new york , texas , and north carolina , are engaged in promising-efforts to overcome particular-challenges associated with their size and diversity . still others -- kentucky , wisconsin , louisiana -- while relatively-slow to embrace the concept of state-planning have , within the past year , made significant progress in addressing-issues of access and quality in their states . what we hope to demonstrate in describing what has been achieved in these selected-states is both their differences and their similarities , the range of different-processes , structures , and strategies that have led to their successes , and the basic commonalties that underlie them in terms of vision , inclusiveness , leadership and commitment . each of the states described in this section provides insights and lessons that can be of benefit to others . in 1998 , california in recognition of the state 's size , diversity and complexity asked lsc to allow it to first develop regional-plans for the creation of `` regional '' justice-communities . lsc approved this proposal and in october received regional-plans from five regions . the current-configuration and planning-successes in each of these regions are described below : the northern-region . since april 1999 , as the result of program-mergers , legal-services of northern california has been the sole lsc-funded-provider for the entire-region , with nine offices covering 23 counties . this region has made significant progress in developing a comprehensive , integrated-delivery-system to provide high-quality-services to clients throughout northern california . in addition to instituting a programwide regional-counsel advocate support/case review system , which emphasizes collaboration and co-counseling on common-issues throughout the whole-region , lsnc is coordinating and advancing a region-wide-advocacy-agenda in welfare to work and housing and economic development . this region has also developed additional-resources for region-wide-initiatives , such as a $ 120,000 three-year-grant from the rockefeller foundation to increase the capacities of three community-based-organizations . the bay area . the bay area was one of three geographical-areas in the united states involuntarily reconfigured by lsc . on january 1 , 2000 bay area legal-aid ( `` bay legal '' ) became the only lsc-funded-program for all seven counties in the san francisco area . the new program , headquartered in oakland , was the result of a merger between san francisco neighborhood legal-assistance ( sfnlaf ) , community legal-services in san jose , and legal foundation of contra costa . in fy 2000 , bay legal was the recipient of a $ 175,235 lsc technology-initiative-grant . this grant will enable bay legal advocates and clients throughout the region to use networked computer-terminals to easily-access-forms and information . in its first year , bay legal also successfully conducted a region-wide '' campaign for justice '' fundraising-effort which brought in significant-funds to all of its offices . the central california region . five lsc-funded-programs previously served the central california region . today , the region is served by three lsc-funded-providers -- california rural legal-assistance ( crla ) , central california legal-services ( ccls ) and greater bakersfield legal-assistance ( gbla ) . these three programs created the california rural justice consortium , a planning-entity dedicated to the vision of a seamless-justice-system in the region . the consortium is working on issues throughout the region , including the legal-problems of migrant-sheepherders and health and environmental-issues affecting rural-clients . in order to address the access-barriers that face rural and isolated-communities and enhance communication between and among the three programs , the programs have developed highly sophisticated-video-conferencing capability . the three programs have also agreed to allow and encourage staff-members to move freely among the three programs in order to respond to clients needs most effectively . the los angeles basin . as a result of the merger between the legal-aid foundation of long beach and the legal-aid foundation of los angeles , there are now three programs serving this region . the programs have hired a joint-advocacy-coordinator who staffs the joint-advocacy project to respond to major-issues that cut across program-lines and can be addressed most effectively by advocates from multiple-programs . one of the first projects jointly pursued by the la basin programs will address the diverse-languages spoken by asian-client-population . under a grant from the open society institute , the programs contracted with the asian pacific american legal center of southern california to provide centralized-intake for asian-clients who do not speak english . if the clients require extended-service or representation , their cases are then matched with staff of any of the three programs depending on the specific-language capabilities of each program . through this project the la basin has found a way to serve asian-clients who do not speak english . the programs are also poised to make a major-investment in technology to expand the delivery of legal-services . the i-can project , funded initially by an lsc technology-initiative-grant , was developed by the legal-aid society of orange county ( lasoc ) to help `` pro per '' clients fill out judicial council forms in family-law-matters . future plans includes replicating i-can throughout the region and locating-kiosks at libraries that can be used by clients for on-line-filings of certain legal-matters . the southern region . the two programs in this region , the legal-aid society of san diego and inland counties legal-services , were relatively-late in region-wide-planning . recently , these two programs have committed to an agenda of specific-collaborative projects , including joint-technology-consultations , joint-efforts by the two boards of directors in areas of mutual-interest , joint economic-development-projects , and assistance in developing-intake systems . both programs are recipients of `` partnership '' grants to run projects to help spanish-speaking `` pro per '' clients in their respective-county-courthouses . both are also active-participants in other statewide-initiatives . for example , inland and san diego have both partnered with crla to respond to migrant-clients needs in the coachella and imperial-valleys . however , significant-integration and planning-work remains to be done in this area of the state . state activities . lsc 's 1998 call for state-planning coincided with an active-period within california 's justice-community . the access to justice commission was created in 1996 as a coordinating body to seek support for legal-services-programs and develop strategies to address the severe-lack of access to justice that had been identified earlier by a state bar-sponsored blue-ribbon-study group . the membership of the commission consisted of representatives from the bench and bar , including many long-term supporters of legal-services , academics , and business , labor and religious-leaders , as well as representatives of the provider community . the first priority of the commission was resource-development and the commission led a sustained effort in the california legislature to obtain state-funds to support the provision of civil legal-services to lowincome-persons . in 1999 , california appropriated , for the first time , $ 10 million for legal-services . the same amount was appropriated in fy 2000 . a 50 % increase to $ 15 million is expected for 2001 . the commission 's second priority was the improvement of access to the courts for `` pro per '' litigants . the commission and planners dedicated 10 % of the state-appropriation for civil legal-services to fund innovative-projects that partner legal-services-providers and the courts to assist low-income self-represented-litigants . with support from lsc 's technology-initiative-grants , lsc-funded-programs are leaders and active-participants in california 's plan to utilize technology to expand access and improve legal-services-delivery . other promising-technology-initiatives include the caljustice technology project of the public-interest clearinghouse , which focuses on increasing-client-access to the judicial-system through the development of an artificial intelligence-based tool to help-advocates quickly-spot-issues in and strategize about cases . the state has also recently adopted statewide-priorities for connectivity and communication , developed minimum-technology standards and created-mechanisms to share best-practices . other statewide non-technology-initiatives include : • inter-program and inter-region collaborative-projects to develop new substantive-expertise and new programs to respond to changes in policy and law impacting upon low-income-clients ; • a system of advocacy-training and litigation-support through a network of support-centers in the areas of health , youth , housing , and economic development ; • the development of standards and assessment-tools tovaluate the support-centers . state-planning in colorado began in 1995 with the formation of the statewide-legal services-planning group . represented in the group were lsc-funded-programs , the organized-bar , the judiciary , both law-schools in the state , eligible-clients , the colorado lawyers trust-account foundation ( the state=s iolta program ) , the legal-aid foundation ( the statewide-fundraising-arm for colorado=s federally-funded legal-services-programs ) providers of specialized legal-services and other groups interested in the provision of legal-assistance to low-income-people . early-planning efforts focused on development of additional-resources , expansion of pro-bono assistance and support from the private-bar and ensuring effective-delivery of services by the federally-funded-programs . initial-efforts addressed a variety of internal-issues including-training and support , increased use of technology , more efficient and uniform-intake and the provision of legal-advice and brief-service , and meeting the needs of particularly-vulnerable populations including-migrants , native americans , non-english-speaking-persons , immigrants and disabled and institutionalized-individuals . progress was made on a number of issues important to the legal-services-community , but despite signs of chronic-weakness in two programs , the 4-program lsc structure was left intact . during lsc's 1996 competition , the service-area of one of these programs was awarded to an adjacent-program . the other received limited-funding , and ultimately was provided a very short-grant . together with lsc's 1998 program-letters , this decision provided the impetus for more serious-discussion of program-configuration which resulted in the formation of a single statewide-program , colorado legal-services , effective october 1 , 1999 . the formation of a single statewide-program was adopted to breathe-life into a single-program that will provide meaningful-access to high quality legal-services , in the pursuit of justice for as many low-income-people throughout colorado as possible . @ this vision became a touchstone for decisions as to program governance , delivery-issues , including-office-staffing , support , training , technology , and increased-access to high quality legal-advice , brief-service and more extensive legal-representation . during the consolidation-process , the legal-services corporation technical-assistance-grants enabled the program to utilize the services of a skilled-consultant and facilitator to move the process to conclusion , to send program-staff to visit and observe other programs with well respected and technologically sophisticated centralized-intake-systems , to bring experts to the program to help design a transition to statewide administrative and personnel-systems , and helped fund the statewide-staff-meeting which launched and celebrated the new statewide-program . the goals of the single statewide-program included establishing uniform-standards for high quality legal-representation , increased administrative-efficiency and the provision of more effective , accurate and helpful brief-service and advice , increased-training , technical-assistance and support for all staff , but particularly for casehandlers in small remote rural-offices , and significantly increased-access for more low-income-coloradans in need of service . many of these goals have been met and others continue as work in progress . initiatives that cls has undertaken to improve and expand services to clients on a statewide-basis included : • the establishment of statewide-priorities that pay particular-attention to the needs of rural , hard-to-reach areas ; • increased-training and advocacy-support throughout the state ; • detailed-plans to initiate a client-access plan which will feature a highlycentralized telephone-based-intake system ; • vastly upgraded technological-equipment , internet access and computer-capability ; • a new case-information-system that will provide improved information about numerous-aspects of the provision of legal-assistance to the low-income-community throughout the state ; • casehandlers-standards to be used as benchmarks by staff in the representation of all program-clients . successful-efforts have also been made to expand resources necessary for the delivery of civil legal-assistance to the indigent . other efforts focus on how to increase pro-bono representation of both eligible-clients and potential-clients in need of service provided by the federally funded statewide-program , and to locate providers for services that may not be available from the recipient of lsc-funds . increases in resource for civil legal-assistance have included : • significantly expanded giving by law-firms and lawyers to the legal-aid foundation of colorado since 1995 ; • after many years of effort , state general assembly appropriated-funds in 1999 ( $ 250,000 ) to serve the civil-needs of victims of domestic and family-violence and $ 400,000 in fiscal year 2000 . the coordinated and focused efforts of the state-planning group have also brought major positive-changes to pro-bono activities throughout the state including : • the colorado supreme court revised rule 6.1 of the colorado rules of professional-conduct , effective january 1 , 2000 , to provide an aspirational-goal that every lawyer provide not less than 50 hours per year of pro-bono-services each year ; • the colorado supreme court amended the code of judicial conduct to more clearly specify that judges may engage in activities to encourage lawyers to perform pro-bono-service ; • the colorado bar association=s board of governors in may , 2000 approved a set of guidelines to encourage pro-bono-service by government and public-attorneys ; • a thorough-review and revision of its private-attorney-involvement activities by cls to further encourage pro-bono-participation throughout the state ; • efforts by cls to maximize local pro-bono-participation while further coordinating statewide technical-assistance and legal support provided to attorneys who participate in pro-bono programs as well as increased recognition of volunteer-lawyers at both the local and state-level . the relationship between lsc-funded-providers and their partners in the state-justice-community in colorado has always been positive . the consolidation of the federally-funded-programs into a single statewide-entity has provided the opportunity for increased-communication and collaboration throughout the state both within legal-services and between legal-services-providers and their allies in the private-bar , client and local-communities and with other key-constituencies . it is expected that continued-planning and concerted-effort will result in higher quality-service provided more uniformly throughout the state , and that clients in increasing-numbers will be the beneficiaries of a more thoughtful and better coordinated state-justice-community in colorado . florida florida planning-efforts began in 1991 with the florida bar and florida bar-foundation 's joint commission on the delivery of legal-assistance study and report . its recommendation to increase pro-bono engagement was addressed in 1993 when the florida supreme court mandated pro-bono reporting for florida bar members . recommendations contained in the 1991 plan also resulted in the institution of tri-annual-peer-reviews for all florida bar-foundation ( foundation ) funded-programs , including the state's twelve lsc organizations . recommendations that programs improve technology-capacities were addressed in large part by a revolving loan-fund , established by the foundation , that enabled lsc-programs and other iota-recipients to purchase needed computer and related technology . in 1996 , the state 's `` companion-system '' was created to serve clients whom lsc-funded-organizations could not represent . more recently , and in response to lsc 's state-planning-letters , planning moved to a new level when the directors of florida's largest legal-services-programs held a retreat to consider how to improve civil legal-assistance in the state . a technical-assistance-grant from lsc , matched by a grant from the florida bar-foundation , enabled the directors to retain the services of a consultant who has continued to guide the planning-process . at the retreat , the 21 directors examined-changes in client-needs and the practice of law over the past ten years . they asked themselves what accomplishments they and their staff were most proud of , and how they could expand these achievements . they considered ways in which the 33 civil legal-services-programs in the state ( including the 12 lsc-entities ) should expand partnerships to ensure that low-income-floridians had access to a full-array of the highest quality legal-services possible . they realized that significant-change in the service-delivery-system was needed because of the increasing-complexity of the practice of law , the number of legal-services-providers in the state , the restrictions on lsc-recipients and , most important , changes in laws and programs affecting-clients . it became clear that restructuring florida 's delivery-system could increase the work that made staff most proud and brought clients the best services . the directors developed the concept of `` statewide , client-centered , energetic , affirmative-advocacy '' as a key-value against which to measure all proposals for change . its elements were identified as : • shared-responsibility for the statewide-delivery-system • collaborative-attitudes on the part of advocates and programs • strategic-thinking about the most effective way to achieve results for clients • advocacy-skills needed to provide effective , high-quality-services • client centered-provision of services • ongoing-self-assessment a survey was sent to all staff at the 33 nonprofit civil legal-services asking them to describe how they could become ( or maintain themselves as ) energetic , affirmative-advocates , as well as what support they might require and how collaborative-efforts in the state could meet those needs . there were 273 responses from 25 programs . the results were reported to the equal-justice-community and posted on the florida legal-services-website , www.floridalegal.org . the initial-planning-effort sparked by the 21-program-directors grew to become a broadly inclusive-structure . participants represent key-stakeholders including-funders , bar-leaders , judges , advocates and clients , among others . its principal-components are : oversight committee . consisting of representatives of the board of governors of the florida state-bar and the florida bar-foundation , the statewide standing-committee on pro-bono legal-services , the project-directors association , florida legal-services , the judiciary , and clients , this group-guides the planning-process , seeks input from stakeholders , establishes a timeline and gives final-approval of the state-plan . action committees . charged with exploring-problems and opportunities in the areas identified in the project-director retreat and the advocacy-survey , these committees focus on resource-development , vision , technology , legislative/administrative advocacy , client-access , collaboration , and training and technical-assistance . each committee developed measurable-goals with estimated-dates for completion . close to 80 individuals serve on the committees . coordinating committee . composed of the chairs of the action committees , this body considered the recommendations of the action committees and integrated them into a draft-state-plan . project-directors ' association . consisting of the executive-directors of the state 's 33 nonprofit civil legal-services-programs , this group has responsibility for ensuring-implementation at the program-level . after circulation for comment to all stakeholders , including county-governments ( the third largest source of legal-services-funding in the state ) , local pro-bono committees , local-bar-associations and area-agencies on aging , the oversight committee released the draft-plan for public-comment in late december 2000 . a final-version was adopted at the end of february 2001 . the 2001 state-plan divides the state into six regions , and highlights a regional-approach in its collaboration and configuration-strategies . each region-houses lsc and other nonprofit civil legal-services-providers bound together by a commitment to collaborate . programs in each region will sign an '' enforceable-agreement '' enunciating the specific-activities each organization will undertake . in january 2001 , lsc asked the florida planners to more carefully explore whether the current-configuration of lsc and non-lsc-funded-programs is one that will best advance their goals . lsc requested that the planners seriously consider the advantages of having one lsc-funded-program-anchor each of the six regions identified in the plan . programs have already moved to carry out some of the plan's recommendations . all 33 programs receiving foundation funds have jointly hired a statewide-resource-director . the foundation , along with the florida state-bar and several-law-firms , have provided funds to hire a statewide pro-bono development-director . planners are seeking-funds to improve the statewide-website and expand internet access to community-education-materials beyond the current community-education-site for immigrant-advocacy-organizations . other initiatives include a statewide-child-support task-force and a statewide emma lazarus project . regionwide-efforts are also underway . in one region , three lsc-programs have established a regional-intake-system , funded by an lsc technology-initiative-grant , with a second planned for another region , to be developed in 2001 . a region-wide-community economic development-initiative housed at an lsc program provides expertise and other resources to all iota-recipients a third-region . a regional special educational advisory project ( involving four programs ) to do outreach and advocacy for children , and a regional team child project on joint-advocacy between legal-services-programs and public-defender-offices for youth entering the juvenile-justice-system have also been established . the florida bar-foundation , which gives substantial-funding to the state 's 33 nonprofit civil legal-services-organizations , has pledged to annually evaluate each of its recipients on their state-planning-work as well as their contribution to the regional-effort . regional-efforts will be a critical-component of the foundation's tri-annual on-site peer-review of each program . thus , programs will be measured not only on their individual-contributions to regional and state-planning , but also on the quality of their region's accomplishments . the foundation anticipates that this approach to evaluations will help maintain the productive-pace of the past-years ' planning and emphasize the importance of joint-endeavors . furthermore , planning-leaders have indicated that configuration is a priority for planners in 2001 , and have developed committees and strategies to address this critical-issue . the lsc-funded-programs in illinois have a long history of working together on joint-projects , state-support and other matters . in 1996 , in response to lsc 's first program-letter , the programs requested that the illinois state-bar-association and the chicago bar-association join them in the planning-process . in april 1997 , under the authority of these bar-associations , the illinois equal-justice project was established . the mission of the illinois equal-justice project included : protecting the integrity and accessibility of the legal-system for all illinois residents ; educating-individuals , families and groups about the self-help process within the judicial-system ; and promoting-costeffective legal-services for low-income-individuals and families . the equal-justice project brought together a very diverse-group of individuals including-representatives of the low-income-client community , social-service-agencies , government agencies , civil legal-services-organizations , religious-communities , the judiciary , lawyers and cultural-organizations to address the need for comprehensive costeffective legal-services in the state of illinois . the project was governed by a steering-committee . in addition , three working-groups were created : non-adjudicatory problem solving ; user friendly pro se adjudication ; and legal-service delivery-system . the project adopted six guiding-principles : • equal-justice is a basic-right , which is fundamental to our democracy . thus , the integrity of our country , our state and our justice-system depends on protecting and enforcing the rights of all people on an equal-basis ; • illinois residents must be educated to protect their legal-rights and accept their legal-responsibilities . they must also have information about self-help-processes and available remedies ; • the justice-system must work with social-services , government agencies and community-leaders to promote holistic , multi-disciplinary-approaches to preventing and resolving legal difficulties ; • since demand for services continues to increase , legal-aid-programs must be supported in avoiding-duplication , maximizing coordination and promoting effective-use of existing and emerging-technologies ; • legitimate political-discourse requires constructive alternatives . attacks on the current-system , often based on misleading-anecdotes , have failed to enlighten participants or improve services to the public ; and • the organizations and institutions , which comprise our justice-system , are largely-local . equal-justice is an integral part of the general-public welfare and funding equal-justice is a fundamental-obligation of state and county-government . each working-group met several times to develop recommendations for changes to the legal-services-delivery system . the recommendations were adopted by the chicago and illinois state-bar associations , and , along with an appendix of existing and proposed implementation-measures , submitted to the governor , the illinois general assembly , the illinois supreme court , local governments , state-agencies , legal-services-programs , bar-associations and individual-lawyers . the focus was on creating a true-system of equal-justice in illinois . ( the report also recognized-work that had already begun among all legal-services-programs with the establishment of a statewide-legal services-delivery and technology working-group , which was meeting to share information on the use of technology . ) as part of the goals developed by the equal-justice project , the chicago and illinois state-bar associations agreed to support the introduction of the illinois equal-justice act in the illinois general assembly . the bill failed in the 1997-98 session but passed the following year . although stripped of any funding-mechanism , the bill authorized the establishment the illinois equal-justice foundation to receive and distribute any money appropriated by the legislature . finally , in the 1999-2000 session , $ 500,000 was appropriated . while less than the $ 1,000,000 sought by the governor , it is a start . in june 1999 , lsc commented upon the illinois state-plan and implementation to date . in its feedback-letter , lsc noted that it was `` impressed with the steps you have taken and will continue to take under this plan to develop an integrated and comprehensive delivery-system that is designed to meet the present as well as the future-needs of low-income-person within your state . '' however , lsc also asked the planners to reopen their consideration of the configuration of the lsc-funded-programs believing that `` a thorough-review of this plan leads to the almost inescapable-conclusion that while reconfiguration may not be a front-burner-issue within this state , there is merit to seriously exploring-reconfiguration of the five lsc-funded-programs into three . '' lsc also suggested that the planners develop ways to involve more clients and community representatives in the planning-process and develop plans to expand their funding-base . reconsideration of the configuration of the lsc-programs has led to decisions to consolidate the five organizations . in 2001 , final reconfiguration of the lsc-funded-delivery-system will be completed , leaving three programs -- prairie state legal-services , land of lincoln legal-assistance foundation , and the legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago . the programs have also followed lsc and the equal-justice project-recommendations to consider more streamlined and cooperative-ways of operating . while illinois initially had five federally funded legal-services-programs , planners identified another twenty-two-programs that were providing legal-services to the economically-disadvantaged . many of these programs were small and most operated within cook county . in november 1999 , the first- ever meeting of all of these programs was held . the legal-services corporation provided-funding for two facilitators and lodging and meal-costs were paid for by the lawyers trust-fund of illinois . the programs met for two days to plan areas of need and cooperation . working-groups were established to coordinate training statewide , to focus on the establishment of a statewide-website and to continue coordination and sharing in technology-matters . the programs continue to explore avenues for improving-services to clients . with funding from the lawyers trust-fund of illinois , the technology working-group and representatives from carpls ( the chicago-based-hotline and referral-services ) , legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago , prairie state legal-services and land of lincoln legal-assistance foundation have formed a `` best-practices '' group . these individuals have visited one another's programs as well as four additional model hotline/telephone intake-systems around the country . as they have observed better , more efficient and more innovative-ways of doing business , new procedures have been adopted . in cooperation with iit kent college of law , legal-services-programs are also involved in establishing a technology-center for law and the public-interest . this will be a single-database that will have three portals for three separate-interest-groups including a portal for clients that would provide them access to client-community legal-education-materials and self-help legal materials . ( this would expand upon materials that are currently-available from southern illinois self-help-center and the illinois legal-services-website . ) a second portal would provide information and video streaming-training for pro-bono attorneys . the final portal would provide access for legal-services-staff to training-materials , discussion-groups , legal-research and other matters . the twelve partners in this collaboration have recently signed agreements specifying the duties of each partner . the site will be located at iit-kent college of law . the illinois equal-justice foundation has recently made its first grants from money appropriated by the illinois general assembly . because of the limited-money available , the first grants were restricted to funding for civil legal-services and hotlines . later this year , the foundation will initiate a study to evaluate the most effective way in which pro-bono can be encouraged and supported . at the present-time , illinois has a pro-bono center whose function is to work with the organized-bar and legal-services-programs in encouraging-participation in existing pro-bono programs as well as to help develop new pro-bono programs in illinois . the focus of the study will be to determine what changes need to be made in the existing-structure to allow the center to effectively meet its mission or , alternatively , to recommend a new structure . this study will be funded by an lsc technical-assistance-grant and will be coordinated with an aba peer-study . in 1998 , the four lsc-funded-programs in indiana submitted a state-plan to lsc that was seriously-flawed . the planners were told that their plan was `` non-responsive to the issues identified in lsc program-letters 98-1 and 98-6 and in need of major-work . '' indiana was instructed to submit a revised plan to lsc and develop a '' collaborative , inclusive and values-driven-plan and planning-process that strengthens services to clients throughout the state . '' serious-planning within the legal-services-community began in early 1999 with a commitment to `` plan to plan '' on the part of the four lsc-funded-programs in the state at that time . lsc gave indiana a technical-assistance-grant to hire a consultant to assist with the planning-efforts . over the course of a long series of meetings and discussions , representatives of the boards and staff of the four programs reached the conclusion that if all clients in indiana were to have access to high quality legal-services , significant-changes needed to be made in the configuration of programs within the state . in september 1999 , the boards of all four programs passed a resolution approving the concept of merger . although merger-discussions continued among the four programs , in march 2000 two of the programs did not vote in favor of the merger-plan , and therefore the plan moved forward with only two programs : legal-services-organization of indiana , inc. and legal-services of northwest indiana , inc. as of december 31 , 2001 , legal-services of northwest indiana , inc. joined with legal-services-organization of indiana , inc. ( lsoi ) by transferring its assets to lsoi . lsoi then changed its name to indiana legal-services , inc. ( ils ) and on january 1 , 2001 became the only lsc-funded-program in indiana . ils currently has a 3-month sub-grant agreement with the legal-services-program of northern indiana , inc. ( lspni ) which previously received an lsc-grant , in order to attempt to reach an agreement with lspni regarding-transfer of staff and other assets from lspni to ils . ils is opening an office in fort wayne , where legal-services of maumee valley , inc. ( lsmv ) still operates . lsmv has non-lsc-funding to represent clients in specific substantive-areas , and ils and lsmv are in the process of developing-referral-protocols to ensure that clients are referred to the appropriate-organization . the formation of ils is based on the `` legal-services plan '' developed by the boards of lsoi and lsni . the plan describes the legal-work , allocation of resources , role of private-attorneys , role of the client-community , role of service providers , governance and program-operations and intake for indiana legal-services , inc . the plan provides for a minimum of nine offices and a 51-member board that is appointed in proportion to poverty-population from the 14 judicial-districts throughout the state . the major-values included in the `` legal-services plan '' are : • the need to remain responsive to and work with local-communities . the indiana legal-services plan makes it clear that ils must look at problems faced by the lowincome-community from both a state and a local-perspective . ils is designed so that it can bring together statewide-resources in order to meet the needs of local-communities . priorities will be set statewide , but each region of the state will have its own case-acceptance-guidelines , which will take into consideration local-needs and resources . each region will have a regional advisory council , with a large number of client-representatives , which will develop these guidelines and work with the local-ils-office to ensure that it is meeting the needs of clients in the region . • the need to ensure high quality legal-work . in order to ensure that advocates throughout the state are linked to each other , the 4 programs developed the indiana justice-center in 1999 . the ijc developed a website with both public and private-sections ( www.indianajustice.org ) , sponsors training-events , coordinates community legal-education-materials , oversees the pilot-hotline project and serves as a voice for legal-services to the bar , judiciary and other entities . the ijc also supports the work of the round table , which has a number of sections ( senior-law , consumer law , public-benefits , housing , family-law , hispanic law , etc . ) to which advocates from throughout the state belong . these sections meet regularly by conference-call and in person in order to share ideas and strategies and conduct training-events . each section also has a `` listserv , '' hosted by the ijc , and a section on the website to which they can post pleadings and other documents that could be useful to other advocates . the round table sections are chaired by casehandlers from throughout the state and responsibility for organizing the agendas for meetings is shared . the philosophy behind the round table is that all legal-services-advocates are responsible for ensuring high quality legal-work of the program . the round table sections also include non-legal-services-advocates , providing an opportunity to share expertise between programs . the indiana legal-services plan also described the pilot-hotline project , which was begun in an effort to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of intake and advice . this project is piloting new telephone and case-management-systems so that ils can determine the most effective way of implementing a statewide-hotline . • the need to expand funding for the provision of civil legal-services to low-income-persons in indiana . indiana is the last-state to have an iolta program . the indiana supreme adopted rule 6.5 of the rules professional-responsibility , which establishes pro-bono committees in each of the 14 judicial-districts . these committees are charged with developing and implementing-plans to meet the civil legal-needs of low-income-people through pro-bono systems . these committees ' plans now receive funding from iolta as of january 2001 . each of these committees has legal-services-representation , and many of the plans are integrally linked to the current legal-services pro-bono programs . rule 6.5 also created the pro-bono commission , which oversees these committees and recommends iolta distributions to the indiana bar-foundation ( ibf ) . the ibf is responsible for the iolta program and has worked with the banks and bar in indiana to launch a successful iolta program . ils continues to work with the indiana equal-justice fund , inc. ( iejf ) , a separate not for profit-organization established in 1995 to raise funds for legal-services . iejf conducts an annual-attorney-campaign , for the benefit for legal-services and legal-aid-programs . iejf was also instrumental in the passage of a general-appropriation of $ 1 million from the indiana general assembly . ils is also committed to increasing local-funds for each of its 9 offices • the need to bring stakeholders together on an annual basis to continue the process of equal-justice-planning and to celebrate indiana 's successes . in february 2001 , the indiana justice-center , with support from the indiana bar-foundation and the indiana pro-bono commission , sponsored the second annual access to justice-conference , a statewide-meeting of judges , bar-leaders , law-school-representatives , legal-services and legal-aid-staff and board members , clients , court-personnel , and others to continue the process of statewide-access to justice planning . 140 people attended the 2001 conference , more than half of whom were not from legal-services . the first conference , attended by 180 people , in january 2000 included-presentations from bar-leaders from michigan and new mexico who reported on those states ' progress in state-planning , an update on state-planning in indiana and breakout-sessions addressing-technology , resource-development , pro-bono and pro se . the 2001 conference featured an introduction of indiana legal-services , inc. and an introduction of the new pro-bono plans in several of the 14 judicial-districts . chief-justice randall shepard delivered keynote-addresses at both conferences , calling upon indiana state-bar-leaders and legal-services-advocates to work together in developing a statewide-system that ensures equal-access to justice for all low-income-people in indiana . lsc president john mckay spoke at the 2001 conference in celebration of the new statewide-program and recognition of the importance of developing state-justice-communities . breakout-sessions addressed pro-bono issues , pro se and technology . planning for the 2002 conference , which will be a working-conference , has begun . • the need to expand the use of technology to provide essential-services to clients . ils has a technology-plan that will enable advocates , both staff and pro-bono , from throughout the state to access-information . the ijc website provides a place for advocates to share information . the technology-sessions at the access to justice-conferences have focused on how technology can be used to link advocates across the state and across program-lines , and how it can be used to directly benefit clients by providing-information and tools for pro se litigants . • the need to improve and expand the role of the private-bar in civil legal-services-delivery . ils worked with the indiana supreme court to submit a successful-grant-application to the state-justice institute for a statewide pro se office , at the office of supreme court administration . this office will work with 4 pilot pro se programs in the state , including the ils pilot-hotline project , to determine best-practices for pro se support , and will develop form-pleadings , approved by the supreme court , for use throughout the state . these forms will be posted on the ijc website . this collaborative-effort is a major-step for indiana in the area of pro se support . these form-pleadings will be used at pro se clinics sponsored by ils and the pro-bono committees throughout the state . a committee appointed by the supreme court will oversee this project , which will include ils staff-members . indiana differs from many other states in that the indiana planners have made considerable-progress in the last few years beyond the reconfiguration of the lsc-funded-programs but , unlike other states , indiana does not have a formal-state planning-body . this state conducts its planning-activities through ad hoc groups addressing discreet-issues . in this way they have involved the judiciary , the private-bar , law-schools , social-service-providers , court-personnel , legal-services-staff and board members and clients in their planning-effort . maine -27 in maine , much of the groundwork for comprehensive-state planning had already been laid when the corporation issued its first program-letter on the subject in 1995 . in 1990 , the commission on legal-needs in maine , chaired by former senator edmund muskie and made up of commissioners drawn from the judiciary , the legislature , the private-bar , and the low-income-community , convened a series of hearings around the state and issued a report calling for increased resources for legal-services with a number of recommendations for improving-access . under the leadership of an implementation-committee created in the wake of the report , over the next five years a number of steps were taken to increase and support pro-bono-participation in the delivery of civil legal-assistance , support pro se litigants , increase iolta participation , and eliminate barriers to access . the state-legislature also followed up on the report by creating the commission on the future of maine 's courts , with a similarly-broad composition . in response to its report , issued in 1993 , a number of steps were taken by the courts to assist low-income and pro se litigants . in 1995 , anticipating the imposition of restrictions on lsc activities and cuts in lsc-funding , the chief-justice of the maine supreme court and the presidents of the state-bar-association and the state-bar foundation sponsored a day-long-forum on the future of legal-services , attended by leaders from the private-bar , the legal-services-community , the state and federal-judiciary , the legislature , and executive-branch . the forum led to the creation of the justice action group , staffed by the state-bar-association and chaired by u.s. district-court judge frank m. coffin . other members included supreme court chief-justice daniel wathen , supreme court justice ( and former lsc board member ) howard dana , the presidents of the state-bar-association and the state-bar foundation , a member of the senate judiciary committee , and a representative each from the university of maine school of law and the boards of pine tree legal-assistance and legal-services for the elderly . the justice action group undertook-responsibility for overseeing the work of a number of task-forces for specific-issue-areas . the work of the task-forces was supported by the legal-services response team , consisting of the directors of the legal-services-programs and directors of the bar-foundation and bar-association . a second statewide-forum took place in 1996 , focusing on the needs of pro se litigants , with continuing-follow-up from all participants . among the most significant-achievements resulting from these phases of the planning-process were the following : • a substantial-increase in iolta rates at most major banks ; • enactment of bipartisan-legislation to increase court-filing-fees and fines to provide funding for legal-services ; • creation of the maine equal-justice project , to provide representation of low-income-people before the state-legislature , and maine equal-justice-partners , a network of pro-bono litigators willing to engage in administrative-advocacy , class-actions , and other broad systemic-advocacy ; • development and implementation , with substantial donated funding and in-kind-donations , of a statewide-technology-plan , enabling the five major-providers to computerize their operations fully and to improve their telephone-systems dramatically , as well as creation of a shared `` information-technology-coordinator '' position housed at pine tree legal-services , the lsc program ; • establishment of a new public-interest fellowship program named in honor of judge coffin , supported with funding by the twelve largest law-firms in portland . between two and three `` coffin fellows '' housed at pine tree have handled family-law-cases on behalf of poor-people every year since 1998 ; • creation of a new family division in the courts to handle family-law-matters and to be more responsive to the needs of pro se litigants , accompanied by simplification of court-forms and hiring of a volunteer-coordinator within the court-system to promote the recruitment and training of volunteers to help pro se litigants . the cooperation among stakeholders that marked these endeavors has led to some exciting-initiatives to improve and expand access to justice for low-income-people . building upon its experience in using-technology to deliver services to clients -- over 150,000 pieces of community legal-education-material are downloaded annually from its website -- pine tree , with the cooperation and assistance of the administrative office of the courts , has developed an interactive-program to assist pro se litigants in completing district-court forms over the internet . the forms can be created on line and then printed out in ready-to-file-form . the project , funded by lsc and the maine bar-foundation , also permits the internet posting of briefs and other materials by pine tree staff to facilitate the representation of low-income-clients by other providers and pro-bono attorneys . most recently , pine tree has received a major-grant from the u.s. department of commerce 's prestigious technology opportunity program to create the helpme domestic-violence project . the project will enable victims of domestic-violence to use teleconferencing and videoconferencing-technology and on-line-filing to confer with pine tree advocates , prepare and file protection from abuse petitions , and confer with judges if necessary , all without leaving the security of a domestic-violence-shelter . the project will be complemented by the helpmelaw website , funded by an lsc technology-initiative-grant . the web site will serve as a comprehensive-portal for low-income-mainers seeking legal-assistance-information of any type , providing-information from all of the state 's legal-services-providers as well as state-agencies and other sources of information and assistance . all maine legal-services-providers participate in the new england training-consortium and have made their in-house-training events open to staff of all the legal-service-programs . for instance , an intensive trial skills-training program has been held at the university of maine school of law twice in the past three years , using donated-faculty drawn from the law-school and the private-bar -- this event has been made available free of charge to all staff-attorneys at pine tree , legal-services for the elderly and the maine equal-justice project . maryland -30 maryland has a long history of statewide-planning . the maryland legal-services corporation over the years has supported various-efforts to examine and improve the statewide-system , including the 1987 maryland legal-services review commission ( the `` cardin commission '' ) , the 1992 commission on the needs of low-income-persons in family-law-matters , and the 1992 evaluation of the pro-bono system in the state . in response to the restrictions and funding-cuts imposed nationally in 1996 , the maryland state-bar-association created the maryland coalition for civil-justice ( mccj ) to spearhead and oversee state-planning . mccj drew together a wide-spectrum of individuals and organizations involved in the support and delivery of legal-services in the state , including legal-services-providers , community and bar-leaders , legislators , and clients . statewide conferences on the delivery of legal-services were held in november 1998 and january 2000 . recommendations from the planning-process led to the development of the maryland legal-assistance network ( mlan ) , funded by the open society institute through a three-year $ 1 million grant to the maryland legal-services corporation . mlan includes four component programs : • a centralized statewide-system of telephone-access , intake , screening , information , assistance , referral and service evaluation ; • expanded pro se and unbundled legal-services ; • an expanded internet-based-people 's law-library-an internet-based-lawyer to lawyer support-center . maryland ranks at the top of the list nationally in the level of funding for civil legal-assistance in the state . lsc-funding represents less than 15 percent of the total-funding available . in addition to the providers with statewide-responsibility -- mlan , the lsc-funded legal-aid bureau , maryland volunteer-lawyers ' services , inc. , and the pro-bono resource-center -- there are more than 30 small-providers that offer legal-services to low-income-persons in the state . some of the small-providers are stand-alone organizations that target very specific-populations or legal-problems . others are part of larger organizations that focus on specific-populations or legal-problems . in addition , maryland has two law-schools that are very active in delivering legal-services to low- income-persons in a variety of areas . maryland is also unique in the depth and focus of the support that the civil legal-assistance-system receives from key institutions within the state . the judiciary is very supportive , with the chief-judge of the court of appeals , the state 's highest court , being deeply engaged in planning-efforts . the state-legislature provides significant bipartisan-support for the legal-services-delivery system . legal-services also enjoys the longstanding , active-support and engagement of the maryland state-bar-association , as well as numerous local-bar-associations . notwithstanding these successes , the equal-justice-community in maryland has continued to look for ways to expand and improve services to clients . responding to concerns on the part of the mccj , the pro-bono resource-center , and others that , despite a long history of strong pro-bono commitment , some momentum appears to have been lost in recent years , the court of appeals established the maryland judicial commission on pro-bono in 1998 to reinvigorate the pro-bono effort . the commission is working to promote active-leadership and encouragement from the bench on a local-level , with oversight from the court of appeals , to increase bar-participation and assist providers in developing more innovative and creative-opportunities for volunteers . in addition , the mccj sponsored , with funding from the maryland legal-services corporation and the project for the future of equal-justice , a thorough-evaluation of the state 's delivery-system by consultant john a. tull . the study , completed in mid-2000 , found strengths and accomplishments and noted many remarkable-features from which other states could learn . it also identified some lost opportunities . it recommended three broad-strategies to address these issues : increasing the flow of information among the providers ; establishing formal-collaborative-arrangements in areas such as technology , planning and development , and substantive support and training ; and creation of a framework for more ongoing planning and system-wide-decision-making regarding-issues affecting the entire-system , particularly with regard to substantive-matters not being addressed . the report concluded that the mccj should lead in planning and overseeing the implementation of these strategies at the statewide-level . minnesota -33 state-planning in minnesota goes back to 1980 , when the six lsc-funded-programs in the state received a special-planning-grant to identify areas for coordination and cooperation . the system in place-today is the result of the processes begun with that grant . the providers worked with the newly created legal-assistance to the disadvantaged-committee of the minnesota state-bar-association ( msba ) to create the minnesota legal-services coalition state-support-center and the position of director of volunteer legal-services , now the access to justice director at the minnesota state-bar-association . the seven regional-programs serving all 87 minnesota counties are known collectively as the minnesota legal-services coalition . directors of the coalition-programs , along with center-staff , the access to justice director , and representatives of other specialized legal-services-providers have continued to meet regularly to discuss and coordinate on issues of statewide concern . in 1995 , in response to the pending-cuts in lsc-funding , the minnesota legislature requested the minnesota supreme court to create a joint-committee including-representatives from the supreme court , the msba , the coalition , and other providers to prepare recommendations for state-funding-changes or other alternatives to maintain an adequate-level of funding for civil legal-assistance . the supreme court established the joint legal-services access & funding committee , directing it to make recommendations to the court and the legislature by december 31 , 1995 . the court appointed a liaison from the court and 29 committee-members representing the legislature , the federal and state-judiciary , lawyers in private and public-practice , legal-services-program staff , and the public , including the client-community . the joint-committee developed a number of principles , including : • the legal-services-programs should continue to strive to offer low-income-people a level-playing-field , access to all forums , and a full-range of legal-services in areas of critical need . • legal-services should be structured to ensure that populations with special-needs , such as native americans , migrant and seasonal-workers , people with disabilities , and financially distressed-family-farmers , continue to have access to legal-services . • adequate state-support services , such as training , community legal-education-materials and mechanisms for information-sharing , continue to be available to all legal-services-providers , including volunteer-attorney programs . the committee report concluded that , `` while the coalition-programs and others are already a national-model of coordination and cooperation , the programs should continue to search for areas in which they can achieve additional-efficiencies and improve client-services through increased coordination and cooperation . '' among the other recommendations of the joint-committee that have subsequently been implemented are the following : • an attorney registration-fee increase to support legal-services , which has added over $ 850,000 , per year to the pool available to grantees . • an increase from the legislature of an additional $ 600,000 to the base-funding for legal-services beginning in 1997 , for a total-state-appropriation of $ 6.5 million per year . • a planning-grant from the bush foundation to identify which technology-applications would increase program-effectiveness , reduce barriers to quality-service and increase the value of services to clients , followed by a major-implementation grant . • extensive-education around the state to encourage implementation of the aba rule 6.1 aspirational-goal that each lawyer donate at least 50 hours of legal-services each year . the joint-committee recommended that the msba consider reporting of pro-bono activities . in 1999 , the msba petitioned the minnesota supreme court to require the reporting of pro-bono-work . the court denied the petition . • a significant-increase in interest rates on many iolta accounts by major banks . legal-services-programs in minnesota continue to work together to integrate and provide a full-range of services to clients across the state . the coalition 's jointly-funded state-support-center continues to coordinate training and support-functions . the center publishes a twice-monthly-newsletter for legal-services-staff and approximately 2,500 volunteer-lawyers . it conducts numerous cle accredited trainings each year , and coordinates bi-monthly statewide-task-force meetings in the areas of family , housing , public-benefits , consumer , immigration and seniors-law . it also coordinates the production and statewide-distribution of community-education and self-help-materials in many languages . to assure each component of the system operates with the highest quality and is integrated , the coalition , with technical-assistance support from lsc , is developing a statewide peer-review system . the coalition-programs have identified their goal as raising the level of integration and cooperation among programs to that of a `` virtual statewide-law-firm . '' implementation of the coalition 's statewide-technology-plan with funding from the bush foundation has represented a major-step toward achieving that goal . the plan sets forth a three-stage process , with implementation-beginning in 1998 and continuing through 2009 . phase of i of the implementation , scheduled for 1998-2000 , is largely-complete . an lsc technical-assistance-grant enabled the state to begin planning for implementation of phase ii , scheduled for 2000-2003 . initiatives completed under phase i of the plan include the following : • bringing every office up to a baseline-level of technological-capacity ; • providing every staff-member with desktop-internet-access and an individual-e-mail-account ; • developing a private-website-information geared toward legal-services-staff , such as staff-announcements , special-training materials , etc ; • developing a public-website to create a legal-services presence-online , providing-office and program-information , legal-education information , and other information for clients and advocates ; • creating e-mail-lists and web-forums for task-forces and coalition-programs ; • developing-technology-planning , education and support to enable all staff and management to use technology as an effective-tool to improve service to clients ; and • providing all advocates with on-line legal-research-capacity , including online-subscription to westlaw research , online updates of recent-developments in poverty-law , and links on the statewide-website to free online-research-resources . a preliminary-evaluation of phase i , currently under way , has found that most users are happy with the overall-implementation of the technology-plan to date and believe that it has significantly improved their program 's capacity and their own individual-capacity to serve clients . many users consider the implementation of the plan to have made a profound-difference in the way they do their jobs . many users commented on the effectiveness of the new technology in promoting closer relationships among providers . future-phases of the statewide-technology-plan , aided in part by an lsc-grant , call for streamlining the intake and case-management processes , developing seamless-communication among all programs and offices , improving-client-access to services , integrating-case management-software , and completing the transition to a virtual statewide-law-firm . a three-year-proposal to support these efforts is also pending before the bush foundation . the programs continue to receive very strong support from the msba , the court and the legislature . the legal-assistance to the disadvantaged-committee , a planning-leader since the 1980 's , continues to work in close-cooperation with the coalition and other providers . the committee 's most significant recent-accomplishment was the launching of the statewide probono.net/mn initiative , a powerful web-based-resource to support all attorneys across the states that are representing low-income-clients . missouri submitted its state-plan to lsc on october 1 , 1998 . on december 4 , 1998 , lsc sent a letter to the missouri planners informing them that lsc had serious-concerns as to whether the overall-result of the plan would be-the-creation of a comprehensive , integrated statewide-delivery-system . missouri was asked to continue its planning-efforts and file a supplemental planning-report with lsc on or before october 1 , 1999 . in late 1998 , primarily because of the inadequacies of the missouri state-plan , lsc made the decision to renew lsc grants to missouri programs for a period of two years . this two-year-funding decision was made to allow the missouri legal-services-programs the time and the opportunity to develop a viable , effective and comprehensive-state-plan . in january 2000 , assisted by two consultants hired by the missouri bar using technical-assistance-grants provided by lsc , missouri 's six legal-services-programs announced the missouri plan for equal-access to justice , a blueprint for action aimed at delivering four major-results over the next three years : • to double the number of low-income-clients served by the state 's legal-services-system ; • to increase by 50 percent the total-funding for legal-services statewide ; • to achieve geographical-parity , increasing the resources available in rural areas to establish equal-availability to legal-services in all counties ; • to make funding available for a full-range of legal-services . in february 2000 , the plan was presented to key-partners at a meeting attended by , among others , the chief-justice of the missouri supreme court , the president and executive director of the missouri bar , the chair of the bar 's committee on delivery of legal-services committee , the chair of the statewide-legal services-planning committee , and other state-leaders supportive of legal-services . participants endorsed the plan and offered their support for achieving its goals . the plan was presented and endorsed by the missouri bar board of governors at its march 29 , 2000 meeting . it has since been printed and made available throughout the state by the missouri bar . to provide public-accountability and support for the plan , the missouri statewide-legal services commission has been chartered by the chief-justice of the missouri supreme court and president of the missouri bar . the commission is specifically charged with assessing the effectiveness of the system for delivering legal-services to low-income missourians and assisting in advocating adequate-funding for legal-services . the first meeting was held on march 9 , 2001 . the following-initiatives to implement the plan are currently under way or planned : state-support-center . a new state-support-center has been created to engage in legislative-monitoring and advocacy , training , coordination of statewide-advocacy , collection and dissemination of information , and coordination of the system of substantive-law-task forces . a center-director has been hired , and office-space located . the programs in missouri are providing initial-funding for the center . substantive-law-task force structure . a statewide-system of seven substantive-law-task forces is being put into place . the seven-issue-areas are consumer , housing , family , income maintenance & health , education , immigration , and disability . the leaders of the task-forces will participate in the task-force-leadership council . each task-force is developing statewide-goals , strategies , and priorities . the work of the task-forces will be showcased at an event celebrating the recent-opening of the new state-support-center . legal-needs-study . with funding from the missouri bar-foundation , professor greg casey of the university of missouri is currently conducting a scientific legal-needs-study that will provide a complete , accurate-estimate of the need for civil legal-assistance in the state . the seven substantive-task-forces are cooperating in its design and analysis . the study will be completed in early 2001 . the commission , the chief-justice , and every local-bar in the state will be invited to participate in a statewide media-campaign to announce its findings and build support for responding to the needs it identifies . new southern regional-delivery system . three smaller programs in the southern-part of the state , southeast missouri legal-services , meramec area legal-aid corporation , and legal-aid of southwest missouri , merged at the end of 2000 . the new entity is now known as legal-services of southern missouri . technology . under the leadership of a statewide-technology-task force , implementation of technology-goals has begun . all legal-services-programs in the state are being brought up to minimum technological-capacities , technology-training-goals are being developed and implemented , and technology-based-support for the task-force-system is being put into place , along with the development of client-access-initiatives . intake . a state intake and advice task-force will be convened in 2001 to examine ways in which to integrate and coordinate intake and advise practices across the state . resource-development . a statewide-director of development has been hired as part of the planned emerging state-support system . a state resource-development action-team and a state rural-development team will be convened in 2001 . the resource-development action-team will use the results of the legal-needs-study to build support for state-funding for civil legal-services , with the participation of the courts , the bar , and others , supported by a public-communications-strategy and a grassroots-support-network . the rural-development team will target potential-resources and launch a campaign for rural-resource-development . new hampshire new hampshire 's state-planning-process began in july 1995 , when representatives of the new hampshire bar-association , new hampshire legal-assistance ( nhla ) , and the new hampshire pro-bono referral-system convened a series of meetings with stakeholders in the legal-services-delivery system to discuss the design , configuration and operation of the lsc-funded-programs in the state in light of pending-restrictions and funding-cuts . among those who participated in the process were representatives of the new hampshire bar-foundation , franklin pierce law center , new hampshire children's alliance , child and family services of new hampshire , the disability rights-center , the new hampshire coalition against sexual and domestic-violence , and the chief-justice of the new hampshire supreme court . from this process , a new non-profit-entity , legal-advice & referral center ( larc ) , was formed to apply for lsc-funding . larc functions as a `` hotline '' that conducts most of the intake for the pro-bono referral-system , provides advice and counsel in specific substantive-areas ( coordinated with other legal-service-providers to prevent redundancy ) , refers cases requiring more than advice and counsel to nhla and other providers , and develops community-education and pro se materials . nhla , without lsc-funding , continues to provide a full-range of legal-services from regional-offices across the state , while the pro-bono referral-system continues to serve low- income-people throughout the state through its network of volunteer private-attorneys . in 1997 , the legal-services-programs secured their first-ever state-appropriation to maintain a new hampshire legal-assistance office in the northern-part of the state . the appropriation has been sustained , and with strong support from the state iolta program , a private-bar-campaign and aggressive-grant seeking , the programs have increased their advocacy-staff by over 40 % . in 1999 , new hampshire planners sought and received an lsc technical-assistance-grant to begin evaluating the new system they created in 1996 , determining how well it works and what changes may need to be made . the grant was matched by the new hampshire bar-foundation and new hampshire charitable trust . a planning-committee meets periodically and the executive-directors and key-board leaders of nhla , larc , and pro-bono meet frequently . a full-staff retreat of the three programs deepened the understanding among advocates about the goals of integration of legal-services-delivery in new hampshire and has led to the creation of a number of committees and task-forces to further promote statewide-coordination . the scope of the planning-process will be expanded by including other client-centered-non-profit-organizations , and a second all-staff-retreat will be held in 2001 . one important-outcome of the state 's recent-planning was the decision to combine the fundraising-activities of larc , nhla and the pro-bono program , under the auspices of the new hampshire bar-foundation . the bar-foundation has hired a resource-developer to carry out this plan . coordinated planning has led to gains in other areas as well . in technology , the three programs have achieved their baseline-goals of providing individual-e-mail and desktop-access to the internet for all staff , upgrading-hardware , and enabling all the programs to use the same database-program . they are currently in the process of developing a technology-plan for the next 18 months . some of the topics under consideration are finalizing electronic-data-transfer between all the programs , expanding the larc website into a legal-services-community website , developing the capacity to distribute pro se materials over the internet , and redesigning larc's telephone-system . nhla 's technology-coordinator continues to provide services to larc and pro-bono on a contract-basis to help maintain the client-databases at all three programs and to preserve and enhance the technological-coordination among all three programs . the planners are in the process of determining a cost-effective method for determining the legal-needs of low-income-people in new hampshire , to serve as the basis for a review and joint statement of priorities among the three programs as well as public-statement of need . also , under consideration is the designation of a statewide-community-outreach and education-coordinator . last year , the new hampshire bar-foundation accepted an nhla proposal to use iolta funds to create a law-school loan assistance-program to help address the burgeoning-problem of law-school-debt , which is driving talented law-school-graduates away from legal-services . in another example of cooperation and mutual-assistance among new hampshire 's legal-services-programs , nhla urged that attorneys at larc be allowed to participate from its inception and recommended that attorneys at the disability rights-center be allowed to participate in the coming year . in its first year of operation , ten-staff-attorneys from nhla and larc received an average of $ 3,000 in tax free-grants to help them pay law-school-loans and stay in legal-services . the new hampshire bar-association continues its long interest in and support of full-access to justice . creator of the country's first statewide pro-bono project and the nation 's second iolta program , the bar continues to house the pro-bono program and seek new ways to expand its impact . currently , the state-bar 's delivery of legal-services committee is attempting to involve government-attorneys in pro-bono efforts , and the bar-association 's pro se committee , chaired by the director of new hampshire legal-assistance , is working with the new hampshire supreme court to create a courtsponsored pro se task-force and launch a thorough study of pro se issues in the state . new jersey the core legal-services-delivery system in new jersey consists of 14 programs that maintain full-time-offices in 20 of the state's 21 counties . legal-services of new jersey , a non-lsc funded entity , administers the quite-substantial non-lsc resources that support legal-services in this state . lsnj is both a funder/fundraiser and a state-support-organization providing-support to the field-programs in training , litigation-coordination , pro-bono coordination , the establishment of accountability-standards , resource-development , technology-support , support for service-delivery innovations , policy-advocacy , major-case-advocacy , and statewide-leadership . lsnj coordinates all of the state-taskforces , holds regular-meetings for project-directors and others and routinely conducts program-evaluations . in 1994 , lsnj announced an intensive comprehensive statewide analysis of the state 's efforts to provide high quality legal-assistance to clients . this process was called `` reengineering . '' in reality however , little of lsnj 's efforts-effort went into '' reengineering '' the delivery-system since it , as well as other legal-services-providers and stakeholders throughout the state , were devoting considerable-energies and efforts into developing new sources of funding to support the work of the fourteen lsc-funded-programs in the aftermath of the 1995-funding-cuts and the restrictions . these efforts were highly-successful . today , funding for the fourteen lsc-funded-grantees in the state comes from three primary-sources : the state , iolta and lsc . approximately two million additional-dollars come from counties , other governmental-units , and private-sources . on the average , only fifteen percent of new jersey grantees ' annual-budgets comes from lsc . in 1998 , when lsc issued program-letter 98-1 , lsnj was already nearing-completion of its formal-three-year legal-services master-plan for the period 1998-2001 . the plan was developed with input from representatives of the state government , the judiciary , the new jersey state-bar-association , specialty-bar-associations , county-bars , law-schools , public-interest legal-organizations , and representatives of the major in-state-funding-sources , the state of new jersey and the iolta fund of the bar of new jersey . the overarching values underlying this three-year-plan included : ( 1 ) the need for legal-services-programs in new jersey to function as a `` concerted , coherent , closely coordinated legal-assistance delivery-system ; '' ( 2 ) the need to develop additional-resources to expand access and improve quality of services within the state ; ( 3 ) the need to incorporate the views of clients and key-partners in making major-decisions about how to design and implement a system of high quality comprehensive legal-services ; and ( 4 ) 100 % access for clients throughout the state . within this framework , the plan laid out initiatives to improve and streamline every aspect of the delivery-system 's operations . the first priority was to continue to increase resources available for client-services . the second priority was to maximize the efficient and effective-expenditure of these resources and to achieve enhanced-outcomes for clients by improving the core legal-services-delivery system . the plan identified-steps and strategies to integrate the core-system with a wider network of partners involved in the delivery of civil legal-services to low-income-persons . as it enters its third and final-year , upon implementation , this three-year-plan has led to the following-accomplishments : • creation of a statewide integrated-intake system ; • adoption of a uniform statewide-case-management system ; • development of a coordinated statewide-outreach and community legal-education-strategy ; • adoption of advisory-protocols for improving-supervision of legal-work ; • a comprehensive-analysis of the full-extent and nature of the unmet need for essential civil legal-aid for economically-disadvantaged people in new jersey ( scheduled to be completed this year ) ; • creation of a technology-infrastructure , and the development and implementation of strategies to ensure that lsc's grantees are fully utilizing available-technology to expand and improve client-services . these strategies include , but are not limited to , statewide-computer-training , periodic-visits -- by lsnj -- to local-programs to assess the effectiveness of their use of technology , development of computerized-intake-questionnaires and case-handling-protocols , coordination of activities with the courts to help self-represented-clients through the use of technology , upgrading and updating-programs ' technology-capabilities and maintaining and enhancing desktop electronic-research capability ; • preservation and expansion of the capacity of legal-services-providers to deliver essential legal-assistance to eligible-clients , including a major statewide-initiative to expand the private-funding-base statewide ; • development of expanded pro-bono efforts to supplement the work of legal-services-programs ; • implementation of new statewide-protocols for ongoing program-self-assessment ; • adoption of standardized-performance-criteria and assessment for legal-services-staff ; • efforts to develop a uniform-program-performance reporting-system that will measure outcomes for clients on a statewide-basis ; and • creation of an effective statewide-capacity to conduct research important to poverty-law-advocacy and extended-representation of clients in areas of critical need . in 2001 , lsnj has begun activities to develop its next three-year-master-plan ( 2002-2004 ) for the state of new jersey . key-points of exploration for this plan include : • a systematic-look at best-practices in highly-regarded legal-services-programs nationally ; • utilization of the results of the comprehensive new jersey legal-needs-study , which is scheduled to be substantially completed by december 2001 , to identify needs and establish priorities for funding and for services ; • further refinement of those statewide-core-capacities ( which new jersey terms `` necessary-characteristics '' ) required of a highly coordinated and integrated statewide-legal assistance system ; • the need for expanded research into delivery options ; • the need to promote experimentation and creativity in developing new ways to deliver quality legal-assistance to low-income-clients ; • full evaluation of progress to date in meeting the goals outlined in the current-state-plan with an initial-report to be completed by july 2001 ; • a new three- year-technology-plan ; and • as suggested by lsc , a new look at program-configuration , particularly in light of both the positive-experiences in other states and the significant-resources and energies that must be devoted to the maintenance of a statewide-delivery-system that has so many components . although some planning-efforts took place in ohio in response to the legislative-changes of 1995-1996 , the recent-round of successful-planning-efforts occurred because of two independent events that merged to become an effective-catalyst for change . in late 1997 , the ohio legal-assistance foundation ( olaf ) -- a major funder of civil legal-services throughout the state -- launched a process of comprehensive-evaluation of each of its recipients , including the lsc-funded-programs in the state . these in-depth evaluations used-teams of respected legal-services-leaders from throughout the country and assessed the quality and effectiveness of each legal-aid-provider with regard to legal-work , client-involvement , management , and administrative-functioning-making recommendations for improvement as appropriate . in january 1998 , lsc independently launched its state-planning-initiative and selected ohio -- a state wherein lsc funded 14 separate-programs including two programs that served a single-county -- as one of its priority-states . state-plans were due into lsc by october 1 , 1998 . however , since lsc was working closely with ohio in planning-activities , lsc quickly determined that any plan submitted to lsc on october 1 , 1998 would not meet lsc 's planning-expectations nor address the issues identified in program-letters 98-1 and 98-6 . accordingly , lsc granted the ohio planners a five-month-extension for submission of their plan urging them to develop `` a planning-process that is values driven , articulates core-capacities that must be in place throughout the state , is sensitive to the needs of all clients in ohio , and is inclusive of all of legal-services stakeholders . in addition… the planning-process and the plan itself ( must ) address the need for program-collaboration and coordination within the state… '' as state-planning-activities were slowly initiated , the program-evaluations launched by olaf were also proceeding . ( olaf extended an invitation to the lsc planning-consultant assigned to ohio to participate in the evaluation of six of the lscfunded legal-services-providers in the state . she accepted the invitation . ) as evaluations were completed , it became increasingly-apparent that the many strengths of the state 's civil legal-assistance-system were offset by significant-weaknesses , including-variation in quality among the programs , insufficient-communication , and lack of shared-responsibility for addressing-problems on a statewide-basis . in mid-1998 , the ohio planning steering-committee was formed to coordinate existing-planning-groups and to make sure-planning was launched where it did not yet exist . the steering-committee was and is composed of representatives of legal-services-programs , olaf , law-schools , pro-bono programs , the client-community , communitybased-organizations , and the organized-bar . a consultant was engaged by the state-planners to facilitate the planning-process . using the `` discussion-draft '' on the hallmarks of a comprehensive , integrate statewide civil legal-assistance-system prepared by the project for the future of equal-justice as a model , the planners adopted as two overarching-goals : ( 1 ) the need for the creation of a legal-services-delivery system that provides comprehensive , integrated high quality legal-services to the client-community and ( 2 ) `` 100 % access to essential legal-services for low-income-ohioans such that they are able to secure substantive and procedural equal-justice . '' measuring the existing-system in the state against that vision , the participants in the planning-process quickly came to the realization that significant-change was necessary . the steering-committee , working through subcommittees , produced a draft-report setting-action-plans for activities aimed at building an integrated , statewide-delivery-system . the plan was shared with other stakeholders , including all program-directors , who then met as a group in early 1999 for a frank and open discussion about configuration . the ohio state-plan : toward achieving a comprehensive integrated legal-services-delivery system was submitted to lsc in march 1999 . it was quickly approved and the legal-services-community in the state has spent the two years since then refining and implementing the plan , mobilized by a new energy and a renewed-sense of purpose . a key-component of the plan was the decision was to reduce the 14 lsc-funded-programs in the state to seven regional-delivery systems . the reconfiguration-process took place over the course of 2000 and has now been completed . in addition to the lscfunded-programs , there are non-lsc-funded-programs in three regions , as well as three statewide non-lsc-funded-programs : pro-seniors , which serves senior-citizens ; the equal-justice foundation , which provides litigation-advocacy ; and the oslsa state-support-center ( oslsa ) . planners also identified the development of an integrated and coordinated statewide-intake-process as an essential-component of an effective-delivery-system for the state . among the specific-goals were the following : • establish telephone-access for clients in those parts of the state where it did not exist . • create centralized regional telephone-intake-systems in the seven new service-delivery-regions for all lsc-funded-providers , as well as other providers where possible . • establish a statewide-telephone-service with a toll-free number that will route callers to the appropriate regional-intake-system . • standardize-intake and case-management-software among programs to expedite intake and referrals . • study-systems other programs use to provide advice and brief-services to clients and development of recommendations as to how these service-components can be standardized from program to program . currently , most of the regions have developed or are developing a regionwide-intake-system , with the assistance of consultants and funding provided by the ohio legal-assistance foundation and funds granted by lsc under a technical-assistance-grant . several of these regionwide-intake-systems are extremely-innovative and offer potential as a prototype for the state . under the leadership of a technology advisory-committee created in early 1998 and a technology-coordinator hired in late 1998 , supported by olaf funds and originally housed at oslsa , the state-planners adopted a technology-plan in 1998 that set-minimum technology-standards for all programs in the state , as well as long-term-goals . in 1999 , the statewide-technology coordinator launched a technology task-force , made up of two representatives from each program , one who is responsible for technology-matters and one who can effectively communicate how their program provides services to the client-community . all providers have now met most of the standards , which include upgrades of computer-hardware and software , computers for all staff , desktop-internet-access , individual-e-mail , and electronic legal-research-capacity . the state has a statewide-website and planners are considering web-based-intake . the plan includes a heightened commitment to client-empowerment , client and community-education , and expansion of pro se options . oslsa is coordinating a pro se project funded by olaf and the ohio state-bar foundation to develop standardized pro se materials for use across the state , set up two pro se pilot-projects in rural ohio , and develop training-materials for pro se clinics . lsc has awarded the state-support-center a technology integration grant for development of web-based pro se assistance with tutorials for victims of domestic-violence . a napil fellow is cataloguing all community-education-material currently in use throughout the state and reviewing them for accuracy , duplication , and needed-changes . new mechanisms for effective and efficient-dissemination of community-education-materials will be developed by community-education and technology-planners . legal-work is coordinated through oslsa and the litigation-director 's task-force , which was created during the planning-process . the task-force has set two initial-goals : to prioritize , coordinate and develop a work-plan for legal-work on a state-wide and regional-level ; and to develop resources to support this legal-work through pooled-resources of programs , collaborations with law-schools , special-funding from olaf and foundations , and the creation of additional-task-forces . oslsa and olaf also play important-roles in the area of training . olaf funds-training for the state civil legal-services-providers and coordinates training for various pro-bono-projects . oslsa has primary-responsibility for coordinating and delivering training to legal-services-staff across the state . there have been a number of successful statewide substantive-law-training conferences . the statewide-website has a calendar of training-events and related-information , and a statewide brief-bank that can be accessed by all advocates is in the works . during the planning-process , the planners recognized that mobilizing and involving the private-bar in the legal-lives of low-income-clients was one of the state 's weaknesses . accordingly , the planning-process resulted in the establishment of a pro-bono-work group to develop and implement a state pro-bono plan . olaf has designated two key-staff to provide leadership in this area . the group is working to expand , enhance and coordinate pro-bono initiatives and integrate pro-bono programs with staff-based delivery-systems , with the ultimate-goal of raising the current statewide-participation-rate in pro-bono programs of under 10 percent to 17 percent . as part of this effort , the ohio attorney-general and governor recently announced pro-bono policies for governmental-attorneys , and the chief-justice of the ohio supreme court sent a letter to all lawyers in the state urging participation in pro-bono-work . ohio is also experimenting with an innovative-project to link churches , private-attorneys and low-income-clients through faith-based pro-bono-projects in areas of the state where pro-bono-participation is low . the civil legal-assistance in the state has a long history of collaborative-fundraising-endeavors . ohio has been extremely-successful in obtaining diversified-state-funding for legal-services and has one of the highest levels of state-funding in the country . in 1993 , the ohio state-bar-association received the prestigious harrison tweed award from the aba in recognition of its efforts to help expand funding for legal-services . olaf has succeeded in significantly increasing iolta-funding in recent years . the initial-planning-report submitted to lsc in march 1999 ranked continuing-attention to resource-development as a very high priority and outlined-steps to ensure continued-support for legal-services from filing-fees , attorney-registration-fees , iolta , and other sources . olaf continues to work each year to try to generate general-revenue-funding . one important new resource has been the ohio supreme court , which initially provided $ 350,000 annually , raised to $ 500,000 this year . the columbus and cincinnati legal-aid capital-campaigns have each raised significant-funding for their capital-campaigns -- $ 4 million in cincinnati and $ 1.5 million in columbus . oregon -52 oregon 's state-planning-process began in 1995 with the creation of the oregon state-bar legal-services task-force , convened by the president of the state-bar in consultation with the chief-justice of the oregon supreme court . members of the task-force included the chair of the senate judiciary committee , judges from the circuit-court and court of appeals , and leaders from the private-bar , as well as members of the oregon state-bar board of bar governors . the task-force worked through subcommittees organized around the following broad-areas : client need/priorities , structure and organization , funding , and ethical responsibility/quality assurance/transition . they gathered-information from a wide-range of legal-services-providers , including law-school clinics , the state-protection and advocacy agency , the juvenile rights project , and pro-bono groups and others in the community concerned about services to low-income-residents of oregon . each of the subcommittees reported to the full-committee . a final task-force report was issued in 1999 . since then , activities have been coordinated through an access to justice-network that includes all the entities involved in planning-efforts . statewide-access to justice-conferences were held in 1998 and 2000 . planners continue to involve an impressive-array of stakeholders , including-representatives of the bench , the state-bar , the governor , the attorney-general , the legislature , and legal-services and social-services providers . work-groups have been created on all key-issues . in 1999 , the state-bar funded a statewide-legal needs assessment to inform the ongoing-planning-effort . planners in oregon have made resource-development their highest priority , concluding that a substantial-infusion of new resources is the key to achieving a comprehensive , integrated statewide-system that provides access to justice for all . under the leadership of the state-bar 's campaign for equal-justice , the state has had considerable-success . the campaign has been raising more than $ 600,000 a year from private-attorneys . foundation-funding accounts for an additional $ 400,000 annually . the state-planners have set a goal of a 50 per cent-increase in funding over the next five years , with an ultimate-goal of $ 10,000,000 in annual-state dollars . currently , the legislature is considering a bill that will charge-out-of-state-attorneys a fee to practice in oregon . if passed , this is expected to generate about $ 150,000 annually , all of which will go to lscfunded-programs . supporters of legal-services for low-income-clients are also working with state-legislators to create a general-fund appropriation for legal-services-programs to augment the dollars generated annually through filing-fee-add-ons that are also directed to legal-services initiatives . cooperative-efforts among the court-system , the bar , and legal-service-providers have made oregon a leader in improving-access to its courts . a successful-pilot-project , funded by the courts , to employ facilitators to assist pro se litigants is being expanded to additional-courts . the facilitators help to improve fairness in the justice-system by assisting pro se litigants in a variety of ways , including reviewing-pleadings for errors . legal-service-providers continue to work with a variety of partners , including the oregon judicial conference , to improve pro se forms and instructions in additional-areas of the law , beyond domestic-relations . state-planning strategies have also opened up other avenues for improving outcomes for clients . creative partnering between legal-services and the oregon farm bureau resulted in a successful-mediation program , housed at the lsc-funded legal-aid-services of oregon , that resolves disputes between farmworkers and growers . there are three lsc-funded-programs in the state , legal-aid-services of oregon , lane county legal-aid service , and marion-polk legal-aid service , as well as two non-lsc-funded-programs and the center for non-profit legal-services . the oregon law center was specifically established to ensure access for disfavored-client populations and issues restricted for lsc-recipients . building on a long history of close-coordination of legal-work , the programs collaborate through five task-forces -- domestic-relations , administrative-law , housing , migrant and elder law . the task-forces are facilitated by senior-attorneys from the various-programs , and meet quarterly . all programs participate . co-counseling across programs occurs routinely , and expertise is regularly shared . the programs have cooperated on a statewide-training needs assessment , and advise the oregon state-bar on continuing legal-education events for private-attorneys to ensure that poverty-law-issues are included . in the areas of technology , planners have targeted a number of long-term-changes , including-upgrading-hardware and software , use of videoconferencing for rural-intake , and creation of a statewide-legal services web site . legal-aid-services of oregon has received a federal-violence against women act grant for a videoconferencing pilot-project that will permit remote-intake from domestic-violence-shelters in rural areas without legal-services-offices . the program also received an lsc technology-innovation grant for a web-based pro se project in conjunction with the oregon judicial administration for family-law . although reconfigration of the lsc-funded-programs has not been a priority-issue , lsc has asked the oregon planners to examine whether maintenance of three separate-organizations continues to make sense . prior to development of its 1998-state-plan , pennsylvania's legal-services-community was fragmented and performing unevenly . nearly , a third of pennsylvania 's 15 lsc-funded-programs were receiving one year-funding because of quality-concerns , and at least one was on the verge of receiving no lsc-funding . pennsylvania programs were also competing with one another for lsc-funds . and , as pennsylvania 's state-plan observed : '' it had never been a state-role to say it 's not acceptable that those in need in one part of the state have less access than those in another part , or that clients in one area have less effective legal-assistance than is available to clients in other parts of the state . '' indeed , in february 1998 , pennsylvania sent a representative to the lsc board-meeting to object to lsc 's state-planning-initiative ; and , later that month , a pennsylvania delegation traveled to washington to reiterate those views . three years later , much has changed . with strong-leadership and financial support from key-members and institutions of the justice-community , pennsylvania is in the midst of implementing a comprehensive-state-plan to `` transform … a collegial-confederation of independent-programs into a statewide integrated-service delivery-system . '' key-features include : • redesign of the delivery-system by creation of 6 regions and consolidation of the lsc-programs from 15 to 8 . each region was required to develop its own plan for a full-service regional-delivery system , with sufficient-capacities in the areas outlined in lsc 's program-letters . periodic-reports are submitted to the statewide steering-committee assessing whether the region has each capacity in place , and if not , what steps are to be taken to put it in place . the program-consolidations have been completed , and each region is moving forward on its delivery-plan . • creation of the statewide-support team housed at pennsylvania legal-services to provide statewide-support and leadership in three core-areas enumerated in the state-plan -- training , resource-development and technology . the three new positions , director of resource-development , technology-coordinator , and training and legal-information facilitator are supported by $ 250,000 funding from the pennsylvania iolta board and pennsylvania legal-services . • development of a permanent state-planning-committee with a strong-determination to build a better system . made of up representatives of the pennsylvania bar-association , pennsylvania iolta , pennsylvania legal-services , and the pennsylvania project-directors association , the steering-committee meets by conference-call on a regular biweekly-basis and assiduously oversees plan-implementation . in both 1999 and 2000 , the committee published formal-progress-reports on implementation of the state-plan . recent-accomplishments in addition to the major structural and leadership-changes include : resource-development . the pennsylvania bar-association 's board of governors and house of delegates has approved the report and recommendations of the task-force on legal-services to the needy , which called for a set of initiatives to increase funding and pro-bono : • expansion of pro-bono programs ; • establishment of coordinated pro-bono assistance-teams in counties without existing pro-bono programs ; • judicial-encouragement of pro-bono programs ; • greater law-school participation in pro-bono ; • increased leadership in the pro-bono area by senior-bar members ; • institution of a $ 5 add-on to continuing legal-education fees to increase funding for legal-services by $ 10 million ; • legislation to increase funding for legal-services through an increase in court-filing-fees ; and • direction of cy-pres-awards to legal-services-programs . the cle fee-increase is pending before the state supreme court . the pennsylvania bar-association has launched an effort to encourage all local-bars to adopt a pro-bono plan . in addition , the statewide resource-development coordinator has established a staff-level statewide resource-development committee that meets regularly by conference-call , created a marketing brochure aimed at funders , provided direct technical-assistance to regional-fundraising-efforts , and developed several major statewide grant-proposals . technology . all providers have met the key-standards set out in the technology-plan adopted in 1998 . there is a statewide-website , www.palegalservices.org . the state-support-team is working with the six regions to develop a web-based case-management system that will support a new intake-system for the state . coordination of legal-work and training . creation of a statewide brief-bank is under way , with funding from the pennsylvania bar-foundation . the statewide substantive-task-forces have been reinvigorated , with support from the training and legal-information facilitator , who has established substantive e-mail-groups and organizes task-force-meetings , in addition to planning and organizing a number of statewide substantive-training-events . next-steps . in its december 2000 report , status and achievements of pennsylvania 's state-planning-effort , 1998-2000 , the steering-committee identified some next-steps : • deciding the best ways to organize regional-phone intake/advice systems and finding the funding to fully-staff them ; • determining how to deliver a full-range of services in those regions , which presently lack the institutional-capacity to do so ; • expanding on successful pro se assistance-efforts to develop more and stronger partnerships with courts and social-agencies ; • strengthening the resource-development and marketing efforts in regions and the state by developing a recognizable identity and compelling-message for legal-services in pennsylvania , and staffing effective regional-resource-development efforts ; • continuing to develop the pls website as a statewide asset by incorporating new plans such as the brief/materials bank and pro se assistance-models and finding-partners such as bar-associations , courts and social-agencies who might share content ; and • keeping alive the conversations begun in 1998 as a vehicle for continuing-momentum into 2001 and 2002 . the statewide steering-committee has recently expanded its membership by adding-members of the pls steering-committee which includes representatives of the pennsylvania clients council . south carolina south carolina strong-collaboration among the five lsc-programs , the south carolina bar , the south carolina bar-foundation and the appleseed justice-center ( formerly south carolina legal-services association ) , has been a hallmark of south carolina 's planning since the initial-response to the 1995 federal-budget-cuts and restriction . at that time , the south carolina bar adopted a dues check-off for legal-services , earmarking 20 % for the former-state support-center , south carolina legal-services association . the bar-foundation also increased its financial support of the legal-services association in order to preserve south carolina's well-respected-support and advocacy-capacity . and in 1997 , largely-due to the efforts of the south carolina bar and the south carolina legal-services association , the legislature , over the governor's veto , adopted a filing-fee-add-on to support the lsc-programs . state-planning-today occurs under the auspices of the legal-services coordinating council . formed in 1997 , at the request of the bar 's structure task-force , the council consists of two persons from each legal-services-program , two persons from the south carolina bar , two persons from the appleseed justice-center , and an advisory-representative from the south carolina bar-foundation . the council 's initial-planning-efforts focused on the creation of latis , a statewide centralized-access , advice and referral-system . capitalized by a $ 353,000 bar-foundation grant , and a subsequent $ 46,000 south carolina bar donation , latis began-operations in december 1999 . latis varies from most centralized-access , advice and referral-systems in that it is a separately incorporated organization governed by a board of directors from the legal-services-program directors and boards , the bar-foundation , the south carolina bar and the appleseed justice-center . operating expenses are paid by the five legal-services-programs for whom latis provides a central-access-point . south carolina 's collaborative-efforts produced another success the following year . in september 2000 , lsc awarded the state lsc's largest technology-initiative-grant -- $ 500,000 for a two-year project that will establish a virtual legal-aid-office in every county of the state , including 23 counties that do not have legal-services-offices . this project , called `` partners for justice '' is a cooperative-venture among the five lsc-programs , latis , the appleseed justice-center , the south carolina bar pro-bono program , and 46 human-services-agencies . the virtual-law-offices will allow real-time-video-conferencing between staff and clients , broadcasted-clinics on a variety of topics , including pro se workshops and legal-education-clinics , and access to streaming video training capsules and pro se pleadings . they will be housed in a variety of locations , including-churches , elementary-schools , libraries , homeless-shelters , united ways , victim-services-centers and municipal-offices . the legal-services-programs have entered into written partnership-agreements with 46 entities across the state that have agreed to house the work stations and provide personnel to be trained to assist potential-clients with computerized-access to legal-services-programs and other attorney-providers . other efforts currently under way or planned include the following : • the five programs have adopted uniform , statewide-case priorities . • a technology standardization committee ensures statewide-coordination of technology-acquisitions and upgrades , and a forms standardization committee ensures standardization of paperwork and administration among the programs . a common case-management system has been installed in latis and all five programs , and a case-management committee assures the system meets the changing-needs of each program . • programs are working on reducing administrative-costs through collective-purchase of insurance , supplies , research resources , fringe-benefits , and the like . • accountability-standards are being developed by the bar-foundation to ensure that each program creates strong-ties within the community with the goal of building local-bar-support and involvement and increasing local-fundraising . • to address the relatively-low level of participation in the delivery of legal-services by volunteer-attorneys at the local-level , the south carolina bar access to justice committee has recommended , and the bar-foundation is entertaining a grant request , to support the creation of a paralegal-position in each program to facilitate increasing pro-bono-participation . • the appleseed justice-center coordinates training and education-activities for program-advocates and private-attorneys to develop expertise in areas of poverty-law-practice , to update advocates on new developments and emerging-trends in law and policy , and to ensure the use of new strategies , tools , skills and advocacy . techniques . it also provides expert-case-assistance and coordination of the statewide substantive-law-task forces . a system of statewide-litigation-teams is being developed . even with these successes , state-planners believe consolidation of the lsc-programs will produce a more unified and stronger voice for clients and assure greater-consistency and a full-range of services throughout the state . with planning-assistance-funds from lsc , the bar-foundation has hired a consultant to help the coordinating council develop a reconfiguration-plan to be submitted to lsc this march . utah -62 in 1996 , the utah supreme court , at the request of the utah state-bar , ordered the state-bar to form the access to justice task-force , charged with reviewing the state of legal-services for the poor in utah , exploring new ideas for improving and expanding those services , and making-recommendations to the bar and the supreme court to implement improved-services . the task-force , co-chaired by the chief-justice of the supreme court and the president of the state-bar , included federal and state-judges , a member of the aba pro-bono committee , senior-partners and leaders of the legal-community , the governor 's general counsel , an assistant u.s. attorney and an assistant attorney-general , the dean of the state-law-school and a professor from brigham young university 's law-school , bar-commissioners and the pro-bono coordinator of the state-bar , directors of agencies serving-low-income and minority-communities , and board members of the three legal-services-programs in the state . the task-force submitted its report and recommendations to a meeting of the utah state-bar in july 1997 , leading to the formation of the access to justice foundation in 1998 . the access to justice foundation continues to be the vehicle for state-planning in utah , charged with implementing the task force's recommendations for improving the delivery of legal-assistance to low-income-utahns . among the initiatives currently under way as a result of these efforts are the following : • the unified statewide `` justice for all '' fundraising campaign was launched in 1999 . in its first year , the campaign raised $ 410,000 . in 2000 , that figure rose to $ 495,000 . for the 2001 campaign , $ 100,000 has already been pledged by a foundation as matching-funds . proceeds from the campaign are shared among providers in the state . • the multicultural legal center , a new organization to provide advocacy in areas restricted to lsc-funded-programs , was created . • utah legal-services , the lsc-funded-provider , legal-aid society of salt lake , and the disability law center are applying for a grant to house the three collaborating-agencies together on one site , to be known as the `` community legal center . '' • legal-services-providers are working closely with the utah state-bar to maximize the latter 's pro-bono-projects by providing-training in poverty-law-issues to potential-volunteers . recent-initiatives have included intensified efforts to train private-attorneys to provide representation in domestic-violence and children 's ssi termination-cases . • with the encouragement of utah legal-services , the state administrative office of the courts is studying the `` self-service centers '' model used in arizona to help pro se litigants for possible-replication in the state . • planners are considering how best to implement the access to justice task-force 's recommendation that a shared centralized-intake system be established for all providers of legal and social-services for low-income-people in the state . as envisioned , this system would eliminate duplication of intake-services and provide clients with instant-links to appropriate-providers . although legislative-efforts to obtain state-funding for legal-services have not been successful to date , planners hope that the legislature might be willing to provide funding to implement such a system , along with other technology-based-projects to expand access to justice . washington washington 's state-planning has been led by the access to justice board . the board was created by the state supreme court in 1994 , and charged with expanding-resources for civil legal-services and coordinating their delivery . its nine members , appointed by the court , represented a range of civil legal-assistance-stakeholders , including the bench , the bar , the legal foundation of washington ( which administers iolta funds ) , lsc-funded-programs and volunteer lawyer-programs . one year later , the three federally-funded legal-services-programs requested that the atj board appoint a committee to oversee the planning-process outlined in lsc 's 1995 program-letter . the board led a broad-planning-process and , in october 1995 , adopted the two documents which guide the delivery of legal-services within the state of washington : visioning justice : hallmarks of a statewide civil legal-assistance delivery-system and the plan for delivery of civil legal-services to low-income-persons in washington state . these two documents define the mission of the state 's civil legal-assistance delivery-system , express key `` equal-justice values '' and attempt to identify corresponding `` core-capacities , '' to serve the mission . the fundamental-principles of these two documents can be summarized as follows : ( a ) legal-services-providers must be `` client-centered , '' i.e. , activities must be conceived and carried out in service and in concert with the populations that are being served ; ( b ) legal-services-providers must strive to ensure the highest and best use of all available-resources within the state of washington and available to the statewide-access to justice-network ; and ( c ) legal-services-providers have a special-responsibility to ensure that no population or client-group is written out of the justice-system based on perceived political-unacceptability or controversy . as a result of these 1995-planning-activities , the access to justice board reconfigured the delivery-structure in washington and created two statewide-legal services entities -- columbia legal-services and the northwest justice project ( njp ) -- to coordinate and supplement the activities of an extensive-network of legal-services-advocates , pro-bono-projects , other providers and supporters within the state of washington . njp is the lsc-funded-provider . njp operates clear -- coordinated legal-education and referral-system -- to provide telephone and internet-based-referral , advice , brief-service , community legal-education and intake-services throughout the state . columbia legal-services receives no lsc-funds . as part of its mission within the state 's civil-justice-community , columbia legal-services is responsible for providing lowincome-people in washington state with the ability to define , assert , promote and enforce a full-range of legal-rights within washington 's civil-justice-system . key-components of the state 's planning and coordinating structure include the following : • access to justice board . the atj board and its committees and work-groups act as accountability-mechanisms , clearinghouses , and coordinating-bodies to ensure that the goals of the equal-justice-community are achieved . the atj board makes regular-reports to the state supreme court and the governing-body of the state-bar on the progress of its committees and work-groups in implementing the state-plan . • annual access to justice-conference . now in its sixth year , the annual-event has become the keystone-event for the entire statewide equal-justice-community . each conference has generated a higher level of participation and sense of community . each has included a broader spectrum of stakeholders , culminating , in 2000 , in a joint judicial , bar , and equal-justice-conference attended by over 800 persons . • equal-justice coalition . the coalition , created by the atj board and underwritten by the legal foundation of washington and legal-aid for washington fund , has spearheaded a five-year-long campaign to solidify broad , bipartisan-support for funding for civil legal-assistance • '' comtech '' ( communications/technology ) committee . this atj committee drew the state 's first communications/technology blueprint and oversaw its statewide-implementation , resulting in interconnectivity for the entire civil legal-services-delivery system . most recently , comtech has teamed up with the office for the administrator of the courts and the coalition against domestic-violence to pioneer innovative interactive-forms-project to improve the justice-system 's responsiveness to victims . • education committee . this atj committee is responsible for ensuring that the culture of the judicial-system is one that demonstrably values equal-justice . among its strategies are judicial-training and introducing the concept of equal-justice into the judicial-screening-process . the education committee sparked the creation of the public legal-education council , a 35-member body created by joint-initiative of the governor , the attorney-general , the office of the superintendent of public instruction , and the chief-justice of the supreme court . the council has adopted goals and a multiyear-strategy to help the public understand their rights and responsibilities and their options for complying with those responsibilities and asserting those rights . • systems impediments committee and the status-impediments committee . the systems committee is charged with `` identifying judicial , legislative and administrative-system impediments to access to justice and recommending and implementing appropriate changes . '' the status committee is charged with `` identifying and removing-impediments to the justice-system for people whose status ( e.g. , physical or mental-limitations , disability , race-ethnicity , language , cultural or other differences , remoteness or physical isolation , etc . ) makes meaningful-access to the system more difficult . '' current-activities include the development of a pro se handbook , revision of administrative-appeal-notices , and expansion of the court-facilitator-system . the committees are in the process of reorganization and consolidation into a single-committee , with the objective of establishing inclusion/diversity/multi-cultural competency as key justice-system imperatives . among the accomplishments of washington 's planning include : • a highly integrated configuration of providers , featuring two statewide-programs , one federally funded and one non-federally funded , and a complementary-system of local-volunteer-lawyers programs , specialty legal-services-providers , law-school clinical-programs , courthouse-facilitator , domestic-violence-advocacy programs and many others . • the design and successful-implementation of the clear intake , advice , brief-services , and referral-system , which provides telephone-services for the entire-state as well as a variety of community legal-education-materials in hard-copy and through its website . • a system of closely coordinated advocacy among providers , featuring statewide substantive-task-forces ; inter-organizational teams that address substantive-issues affecting large numbers of low-income-residents ; co-counseling across programs ; and dedication of three staff at columbia legal-services to statewide-advocacy coordination . • a deep-commitment by the private-bar to provide equal-justice to low-income-persons reflected in the provision of pro-bono representation in some 35,000 cases annually . • a statewide-system of training . • institution of a system of family-law-facilitators in the courts ; development of a core-curriculum for the judiciary on access to justice , including dealing with pro se litigants ; and other joint-initiatives among the bar , the courts , and legal-services-providers to expand access to the courts . • the development and implementation of a system-wide technology-plan with compatible-platforms for case-management-systems ; hardware and software-standards for the civil equal-justice-community ; intake , timekeeping and system-integration ; networked computers ; the capacity to ensure coordination of technology-efforts throughout the delivery-system ; computer and software-technology to support case-handlers at the two statewide-programs , pro-bono-services , and specialty legal-services-providers ; linked websites with community legal-education-materials , selfhelp-materials and forms , and instructions for accessing-providers ; and systems for technology-training and support . • a shift in the equal-justice-community , from a culture characterized by a group of separate , independent-entities that work effectively together in a coordinated effort to one in which members perceive themselves as a cohesive , comprehensive , integrated-team . • a dedication to inclusion/diversity/multi-cultural competency which manifests itself in effort to seek out and nurture new leaders so that the system will not only survive leadership-succession , but will continue to adhere to the core vision and values embedded in the community in ways that ensure the highest degree of relevancy to the increasingly-diverse communities of clients in need of equal-justice-services . west virginia -70 planning-efforts in west virginia have been coordinated through the west virginia legal-services symposium , originally created by the state-bar and bar-foundation in 1995 . the symposium , while not yet a formalized-body , is a broad working-group that has included representatives of the west virginia supreme court of appeals , several circuit-court judges , two federal-district court judges , and the president and other officers of the state-bar . other participants in the symposium and its numerous-standing-committees include legal-services-advocates and program-board-members , representatives of the state attorney-general 's office and other government-attorneys , faculty from the west virginia college of law , bar-leaders , and representatives of the domestic-violence and human-services-communities . the symposium has been the forum for debate and discussion of a wide-range of equal-justice-issues , from the mission of the civil legal-assistance delivery-system to the design and implementation of a number of specific-initiatives aimed at unifying , expanding and improving the state 's equal-justice-community . the symposium has also been the vehicle that has helped enable west virginia to unify and transform its delivery-system . while five years ago there were 4 lsc-programs , the state will operate one statewide lsc program beginning january 1 , 2002 . the first mergers occurred in 1996 subsequent to lsc-funding cuts , when the smallest lsc program , north central west virginia legal-aid society merged with the largest program west virginia legal-services plan . four years later , the appalachian research and defense fund merged with the legal-aid society of charleston at the start of 2000 to create appalachian legal-services . renewed planning-efforts and a commitment to build statewide-core-functions and capacities led to the final planned-merger between appalachian legal-services and the west virginia legal-services plan . planning and organizing for this final-merger has been extensive , and a merger-website at www.wvlegalservicesmerger.org helps facilitate the process . members of the symposium organized and launched a new , unrestricted legal-services-provider , mountain state-justice in 1996 . this non-lsc funded entity is available to clients throughout the state and currently consists of six full and part-time-staff attorneys . funding for this organization is provided by iolta , private-foundations , attorney-fees , and donations . the west virginia college of law , the state 's only law-school , is playing an increasingly-important role in the development of statewide-technology and support-systems . the development of a statewide-legal services website , based at the west virginia college of law , is currently-underway . the interactive-site will include pro-bono resources and community legal-education-materials as well as provider-information and support-resources . it will be part of a coordinated web information-delivery strategy involving the courts and broad-range of non-traditional-partners . the symposium 's intake , access , delivery , self-help and prevention committee is developing-ways to improve system-integration and client-access , including-institution of a statewide telephonic-intake , advice and referral-system . they are coordinating their efforts with pro se and client-education information-systems . the futures commission of the west virginia judiciary recently recommended that a pro se coordinator be located at each county-courthouse . through its committee on coordination and collaboration with the private-bar , the symposium has sponsored a number of efforts to expand private-bar-involvement including better recruitment , training , and support for private-attorneys willing to participate in the delivery of civil legal-services to low-income-persons . in concert with the west virginia state-bar , the symposium will launch a permanent pro-bono review committee to facilitate the provision of services by volunteer-lawyers . last year , the state domestic-violence-coalition received a vawa grant to set up 13 new local pro-bono programs in the 13 communities where there are domestic-violence-shelters . pro-bono attorneys provide clients legal-assistance at the final domestic-violence protective-order-hearing . as a result , significant new private-attorney-resources have been developed in these communities and client-representation has dramatically increased . the statewide-technology committee is standardizing all systems , and a statewide-technology-plan for the state is set to be completed in early june . the key-challenge facing-planners in the state is finding a way to increase funding in order to significantly expand the capacity for services . in addition to establishing a single statewide coordinated fund raising-plan , the symposium is exploring legislative-proposals involving fee-shifting-statutes , as well as more traditional-approaches , such as filing-fees , surcharges , or an increase in bar-dues . the delivery of legal-services in west virginia will soon be enhanced by a statewide $ 1.6 million tanf grant . by far the largest increase in resources in many years , these funds will allow the hiring of 12 attorneys and 12 paralegals to provide service to tanf recipients on a wide-array of legal-problems that can obstacles be to making a transition from welfare to work . the addition of this staff will increase the state 's legal-service 's advocacy-staff by over one-third . although there is no single-model for success , many states that are building-state-justice communities share similar characteristics that can guide other states less far along . particular-models , strategies , and approaches that have proven successful in one state may be useful to others , while the progress of the national-initiative to build state-justice-communities as it has played out across the country provides some valuable-information for national-leaders and institutions . the following identifies some of the lessons that can be gleaned from observing states that have made significant progress toward building-state-justice communities and attaining the goal of equal-justice . included also are models and initiatives that have proven successful or hold out the promise of success . a . broad lessons • there is no single-model for building a state-justice-community . states that are on the road to success have taken a variety of different-approaches , based on particular-circumstances , challenges , and opportunities . • people within a state must feel the need to and some urgency for changing the legal-services-delivery system . change is difficult and time-consuming ; people do not willingly make dramatic-changes in the way they go about their business unless and until they feel that the situation demands it . similarly , legal-services-delivery systems will not change until they come to recognize that access , quality , expansion of resources , promotion of diversity , bi-partisan-support and public-acceptance are issues that must be addressed . the goal is to light a fire without burning down the tent . we can be proud of what we have accomplished over the last 25 years while still understanding that we need to do more and better . • building and maintaining a state-justice-community is an ongoing-process . the fact that it is a process means that somebody has made a decision about the direction the process should take , and it implies some ability to predict the outcome of the process through implementation of strategies designed to accomplish the desired objective . it also requires continuous-dedication and effort on the part of all those entities and individuals in the state committed to equal-justice . even the few states that have succeeded in building a justice-community that has significantly expanded and improved-services for low-income-people have not achieved the ultimate-goal of realizing equal-justice for low-income-people . • a firm-grounding in shared values and a shared-vision will increase the likelihood of success . most successful-efforts to build a justice-community have begun with a process to identify the values that will inform planning-efforts and provide the basis for a shared-vision of what the process is intended to achieve . shared values and vision impel the ongoing-investment of time and energy that is necessary for success and have enabled processes in a number of states to get past-areas of disagreement . values and vision paint the picture that drives the action . • planning-initiatives must be based upon a structured and principled-determination of the needs of client-communities . a key task of the planning-process is to identify the major legal and justice-system-related-issues confronting low-income-people and communities in the state and to develop the best possible-methods and mechanisms to address them . some states have used a thorough client-needs study or report as a basis for their planning-efforts . involving a broad-based-group of stakeholders in the design , supervision , or administration of the study or report has helped to ensure that partners are fully invested in its findings and the implementation of proposed solutions . in different-states , the study or report has been initiated or overseen variously by the courts , the legislature , the state-bar-association , or an officially chartered commission or similar-entity . • leadership is key . the states that have made progress toward building-justice-communities have all had leaders willing and able to see the need for change , unafraid of taking a statewide perspective , eager to put the needs of clients first , to accept responsibility for meeting those needs , and to `` keep their eyes on the prize , '' that is on the core-values and vision on which the process and its initiatives are based . moreover , these leaders have successfully defined a series of goals and objectives that are founded in the community 's belief in equal-access to justice and they have been adept at communicating their goals to others . • planning and implementation require staffing and support . planning-processes are complicated . ongoing-coordination and support for them are essential . permanent-change will occur within and among our state-communities of justice only if participating-organizations adopt new structures and approaches that can cope with a growing demand for flexibility and diverse high quality legal-services . • many states have found that involving an experienced planning-consultant in the initial-phases of launching a process and developing a plan can be valuable , particularly where difficult issues involving institutional-relationships are present . central coordination and support of an ongoing-planning-process and implementation of its various-initiatives can be provided by '' access to justice '' staff at the state-bar or bar-foundation , iolta staff , legal-services state-support staff , or staff working directly for a statewide-commission or task-force . • building a state-justice-community is demanding and involves real-costs . the planning-processes under way across the country have required a tremendous-expenditure of time and energy , as well as actual-out-of-pocket-costs for staff , planning consultants , and other expenses . lsc has been able to provide some financial support for these activities , but because of our limited discretionary-spending , our capacity to contribute is limited . all of the partners that make up state-justice-communities must understand and accept the need for an ongoing-commitment to contribute their time and energy to these efforts and that those with funding-capacity must bear a share of the costs . this investment , while significant , will be far outweighed by the pay-off in terms of increased-access and expanded-services for low-income-people and the intangible-benefit that realizing the ideal of equal-justice for all americans . • if a state is going to successfully create a state-justice-community , someone has to be responsible for it . in other words , state-planning can not be left to take care of itself . someone ( an individual-person or group of persons ) must advocate for change , must be willing to do the work necessary to secure the change , and must be committed to doing what it takes to make the change permanent . • the creation of state-justice-communities will be successful only if there is encouragement and legitimization of constructive-dissatisfaction . on-going-evaluation of progress is important . openness , candor and frank-feedback are essential . • state-planning will fail unless there is acceptance of and encouragement for the risks inherent in experimentation and innovation . innovation in processes , structures and approaches must be encouraged -- even when they do n't work out . people should be encouraged to explore innovative , creative or experimental approaches to the delivery of legal-services . • the successful state-planning-initiative requires open-communication . planning that results in permanent-change will occur most readily and effectively where collaboration and team-building is rewarded and infighting and/or turf-protecting-activities are shunned . and no one can be cut out of the process . state-planning fails when groups of stakeholders feel ignored , marginalized or unimportant . • obstacles and setbacks must be anticipated . changing a delivery-system that has been in place for a quarter of a century is difficult . it will take longer than you anticipate . skeptics will try to derail it . there will be failures along the way , and the personal-costs for some stakeholders can not be overestimated . do n't expect the path forward to be smooth but do n't let the obstacles overwhelm you . • in the end a state-planning-initiative takes time , a commitment to forego-issues of turf and personal-interests , and a supportive-reward-system . the creation of state-justice-communities does not happen overnight , and it does not happen without some personal-pain ( long-time legal-services-staff have seen their jobs change in front of their eyes ) . each state must create ways to honor its heroes , record and reward its progress . b . models and initiatives the following are some tools and strategies employed effectively by states included in this report . this list is intended only to provide some useful-examples ; it does not purport to be a complete listing of all the states that have employed these tools . • access to justice commission , task-force , or other high-level statewide-entity to launch and/or oversee planning-process .
