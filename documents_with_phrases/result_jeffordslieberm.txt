economic-analysis of a multi-emissions strategy prepared for : senators james m. jeffords and joseph i. lieberman u.s. environmental-protection agency office of air and radiation office of atmospheric programs october 31 , 2001 executive-summary in response to a may 17 , 2001 request from senators james m. jeffords ( vt ) and joseph i. lieberman ( ct ) , this report describes the results of a modeling-study done to evaluate the potential-impacts of reducing-nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) , sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , mercury ( hg ) , and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions from the us electric-power-sector . in their request , senators jeffords and lieberman asked the environmental-protection agency to undertake an economic-assessment of four technology-based-scenarios designed to achieve the following-emissions-caps in the us electric-power-sector by the year 2007 : • reduce nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) emissions to 75 percent below 1997 levels ; • reduce sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) emissions to 75 percent below full-implementation of the phase ii requirements under title iv ; • reduce mercury ( hg ) emissions to 90 percent below 1999 levels ; and • reduce carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions to 1990 levels . the request also specified that epa should evaluate the cost of achieving these reductions using four alternative-technology scenarios : • the energy information agency 's standard-technology scenario . • the energy information agency 's high technology-scenario , including-technology-assumptions with earlier introduction , lower costs , higher maximum-market-potential , or higher efficiencies than the standard-scenario . • two scenarios from scenarios for a clean-energy-future published by oak ridge national laboratory , national renewable energy laboratory , and lawrence berkeley national laboratory , which include assumptions about changes in consumer-behavior , additional-research and development , and voluntary and information-programs . under each scenario , the costs of meeting the emission-constraints are included in the price of electricity . such costs include the purchase and installation of emissions-control equipment and the purchase of emissions-permits . factors that mitigate projected cost-increases include the availability of more cost-effective , energy-efficient-technologies for both consumers and electricity-suppliers . epa 's analysis indicates that , under the conditions described above : • electricity-prices in 2015 would increase by about 32 % to 50 % , depending on the technology-scenario . • coal-fired-electric generation would decline by 25 % to 35 % by the year 2015 . • overall-costs , measured by the decline in household-consumption of goods and services , would be between $ 13 and $ 30 billion annually or 0.1 % to 0.3 % of total-consumption . under all four of the policy-scenarios evaluated in this assessment , gross domestic product ( gdp ) would remain relatively-unchanged as sacrificed consumption permits higher investment and government-spending to reduce emissions . • oil and gas-fired-generation would be expected increase by about 8 % under more restrictive-technology-assumptions , but decrease by as much as 20 % under scenarios that embody more optimistic-assumptions about energy-efficiency-demand and supply-technologies . the combination of increased prices and the availability of more energy-efficient-equipment and appliances are projected to reduce electricity-demand by about 10 % . with the combination of higher prices and improved efficiency , total-expenditures for electricity-consumption in 2015 are projected to increase by about 17 % to 39 % , depending on the scenario . the increase in electricity-prices and cost of the program , as well as the impact on the fuel-mix , varies considerably based the technology-future that is assumed . for example , the 30 % electricity-price increase , the $ 13 billion reduction in personal-consumption , and the 25 % decline in coal-use are all associated with the clean-energy-future advanced-scenario , which includes the most optimistic technology-assumptions . likewise , the 50 % electricity-price increase , the $ 30 billion reduction in personal-consumption , and the 35 % decline in coal-usage are all associated with eia's standard-technology scenario . epa was not asked to evaluate the merits of the alternative-technology scenarios . we note , however , that they are the subject of considerable-controversy . the clean-energy-future scenarios have been criticized on several-grounds : assumed-changes in consumer-behavior that are not consistent with historic-behavior-patterns , results from research and development-funding-increases that have not occurred , and voluntary and information-programs for which there is no analytic-basis for evaluating the impacts . on the other hand , supporters of those scenarios point to economic-analyses showing that the assumed-investments can pay for themselves over time . the range of estimates associated with the different-technology-scenarios highlights the importance of the technology-assumptions . in conducting the modeling requested by senators jeffords and lieberman , epa has assumed that the reductions would be achieved through a nationwide `` cap-and-trade '' system similar to the acid-rain-program established under the 1990 amendments to the clean-air act , together with increasing-penetration and performance of energy technologies . in accordance with the senators ' request , the analysis also assumes the use of banked-allowances made possible by early-emissions-reductions achieved in the years 2002 through 2006 . ( in practice , significant-reductions beginning in 2002 would be difficult to achieve . ) because of the contribution of those banked-allowances to overall-emissions-reductions , the analysis shows emissions in 2007 above the caps . regardless , 2007 emissions are substantially reduced from current levels . at the end of 2015 a small-pool of banked-allowances continues to be available for use in later-years . the analysis contained in the report covers the years 2002 through 2015 . the results provided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts of actual-scenario-outcomes . rather , they are assessments of how the future might unfold compared to a previously defined reference-case - given the mix of technology and policy-assumptions embodied in each of the scenarios . the results also imply a national-commitment that is successful in achieving the level of emission-reductions described within the report . the economic-impacts of the emissions-reduction-scenarios are evaluated using argonne national laboratory 's amiga model , a 200-sector computer general-equilibrium-model of the u.s. economy . the modular-design and economy-wide-coverage of the amiga model makes it a logical-choice to analyze alternative-technology scenarios . although it does employ the same plant-level-coverage of the electricity-sector as the ipm and nems models used in other analyses , the pollution-control technology-assumptions are not included at the same level of detail as the ipm model . this may be particularly-relevant for mercury-controls , where the effectiveness varies by coal-type , and may be difficult to model correctly without additional-detail . in addition , we note that the amiga model is relatively new and has not been subject to the same degree of peer-review and scrutiny as the older ipm and nems models . it would be desirable in future-work to establish the comparability of results across these models . 1 . introduction 1.1 . background responding to an earlier congressional-request , the energy information administration ( eia ) released a detailed study reviewing the effects of a so-called `` three pollutant '' strategy in december 2000 ( energy information administration , 2000 ) . the three emissions in the eia assessment included-nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) , sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) . although a coordinated climate and air-quality-policy appeared to lower costs compared to a series of separate-policy-initiatives , the eia assessment indicated significant-costs associated with capping-emissions . at about the same time , five of the nation 's national-energy laboratories released an extensive-review of some 50 different policy-options that might achieve cost-effective-reductions of both air-pollutants and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions . the study , scenarios for a clean-energy-future ( interlaboratory working-group , 2000 ) , indicated that domestic-investments in energyefficient and clean energy-supply-technologies could achieve substantial-reductions in both sets of emissions at a small but net positive benefit for the economy . on may 17 , 2001 , senators james m. jeffords ( vt ) and joseph i. lieberman ( ct ) sent a letter to eia and epa seeking further clarity in the scenarios examined by the december eia analysis , stating that `` the analysis appears to unnecessarily limit the market and technology-opportunities that might significantly affect the costs and benefits of emission-reductions . in particular , the potential contributions of demand-side-efficiency , gas-fired-cogeneration and of renewable-energy-sources appear to be inadequately represented . '' in responding to this request , epa modeled the combined impacts of both the emissions-caps and the advanced-technology-scenarios specified by the senators . we are aware that eia has modeled the combined impacts but has also modeled the effects of the emission-caps and the advanced-technology-scenarios separately . this approach provides perhaps a better technique for isolating the actual-costs of the emissions-caps . we have reviewed the eia analysis of these separate-effects and we believe that they offer interesting and important-insights and that if we had performed the same kind of analysis we would have seen similar-results . this report responds to the senators ' request . the results provided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts of actual-scenario-outcomes . rather they are assessments of how the future might unfold compared to a previously defined reference-case - given a national-commitment to achieve the emission-reductions , and given the mix of technology and policy-assumptions embodied in each of the scenarios . 1.2 . technology-scenarios in the letter to administrator whitman , senators jeffords and lieberman asked for an analysis of four different-scenarios , requesting that epa `` analyze the cost and benefits , including all sectors of the economy and impacts on both the supply and demand-side of the equation , of the following-multi-pollutant-emission control-scenarios for the nation 's electricity-generators . where feasible , this should include power plants both within the conventionally defined electric-utility-sector as well as electricity generated by industrial-cogenerators and other independent-power-producers . '' the four scenarios are identified as follows : • scenario a : standard-technology scenario . assume standard-technology characteristics as defined in aeo2001 . further assume a start-date of 2002 . by 2007 reduce nox-emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels , reduce so2 emissions to 75 percent below full-implementation of the phase ii requirements under title iv , reduce mercury-emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels , and reduce co2 emissions to 1990 levels . • scenario b : high technology-scenario . continue the 2002-start-date , but assume the advanced-technology-assumptions of both the supply and demand-side-perspectives that are referenced in aeo2001 . by 2007 reduce nox-emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels , reduce so2 emissions to 75 percent below full-implementation of the phase ii requirements under title iv , reduce mercury-emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels , and reduce co2 emissions to 1990 levels . • scenario c : moderate clean-energy-future scenario . continue the 2002-start-date , but assume the moderate-supply and demand-side-policy-scenario of the clean-energy-future ( cef ) study . by 2007 reduce nox-emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels , reduce so2 emissions to 75 percent below full-implementation of the phase ii requirements under title iv , reduce mercury-emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels , and reduce co2 emissions to 1990 levels . • scenario d : advanced clean-energy-future scenario . continue the 2002-start-date , but assume the advanced-supply and demand-side-policy-scenario of the clean-energy-future study . by 2007 reduce nox-emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels , reduce so2 emissions to 75 percent below full-implementation of the phase ii requirements under title iv , reduce mercury-emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels , and reduce co2 emissions to 1990 levels . in requesting an analysis of these four scenarios , the senate request asked for `` …results through 2020 , in periods of five years or less , using the annual energy outlook 2001 ( aeo2001 ) as the baseline . '' 1.3 . multi-emission-targets table 1 identifies the 2007-emission-caps used for each of the four scenarios . the emission-cap is defined by a benchmark-emission level that is modified by the desired level ( percentage ) of reduction . for example , the benchmark for the so2 emissions-cap is the phase ii requirements of the clean-air act amendments . that total , 8.95 million short-tons , is reduced by a specific-percentage ( 75 percent ) to reach the emissions-cap of 2.24 million tons . following a similar-pattern , the remaining-emission-caps are set as 1.51 million tons for nox-emissions , 4.8 tons for mercury-emissions , and 475 million metric-tons ( mtc ) of carbon emissions . table 1 . benchmark-emission-levels and assumed emission-caps 1.4 . other analytical-assumptions as previously noted , the letter from senators lieberman and jeffords requested that epa use four different-sets of technology and policy-assumptions to meet the specified-emission-caps shown in table 1 . the full-set of technology and policy-assumptions are described more fully in section two of this report . all scenarios are implemented in 2002 . at the same time , there are other key-assumptions that epa adopted to facilitate the evaluation of the four scenarios . in addition to the different-technology-scenarios , epa was asked to include the assumption that utilities would begin to make cost-effective-emission-reductions in the five years that precede the 2007-compliance-date . these early-reductions would be `` banked '' for use in the post-2007 period of analysis . for purposes of this simulation , the amount of allowances banked from 2002 through 2006 was calculated as the simple-difference between the reference-case projections and the actual-emission-trajectory of each scenario . the decision to earn and hold early-allowances is based on the assumption that allowances are viewed as an asset that must earn at least an 8 % real return.1 following the assumption used in the cef study , all four of the policy-scenarios assume nationwide-restructuring of the electric-utility-industry . this implies that prices are based on the marginal rather than the regulated , cost-of-service-pricing now used throughout much of the country . epa employed the argonne national laboratory 's amiga-modeling-system to evaluate the impact of capping-emissions under the four different-technology-scenarios . amiga is a 200 plus sector-model of the u.s. economy that captures a wide variety of technology-characteristics and their resulting-impact on key-indicators such as emissions , employment and income.2 epa 1 in practice , it is more likely that significant-reductions that contribute to any kind of allowance-bank would be difficult to achieve before 2004 . assuming a delay in implementation to 2004 would raise the economic-impact of any of the scenarios . 2 amiga is especially suited to the t ask identifying and evaluating a different-mix of technologies in the production of goods and services within the united states . it is not only a 200 plus sector-model of the u.s. economy , but it also includes the argonne-unit-planning and compliance-model and database that captures a wide variety of technology-characteristics within the electric-generating-sector , including industrial combined heat and power-systems and the typically available-emission-control technologies . when the electricity-module is integrated with asked-argonne to benchmark amiga to the reference-case projections of aeo2001 . amiga was then modified to approximate the assumptions behind each of the four scenarios . an economic-analysis of a policy compares the world with the policy ( the policy-scenario ) to the world absent the policy ( the reference-case or baseline-scenario ) . the impacts of policies or regulations are measured by the resulting-differences between these two scenarios . in effect , any meaningful-analysis should compare the full-set of benefits and costs to the extent possible . for purposes of this exercise , there are at least seven categories of costs and four benefits that might be reviewed . the costs include : ( 1 ) direct-investment-costs , ( 2 ) operating and maintenance-costs , ( 3 ) research and development and other government-program-costs , ( 4 ) transaction , search , and compliance-costs , ( 5 ) adjustment-costs associated with large-changes in specific-capital-stocks , ( 6 ) lost economic-flexibility created by additional-emission-requirements , and ( 7 ) potential-interactions with the existing-tax-system . at the same time , there are at least four categories of benefits . these include : ( 1 ) direct-savings from lower compliance-costs , ( 2 ) process-efficiency and other productivity-gains , ( 3 ) environmental and health-benefits not captured within normal-market-transactions , and ( 4 ) spillovers and/or learning induced by either the technology-investment , or the r & d efforts . the costs associated with the emission-limits in each scenario are computed as the increased expenditures on pollution-control , investment in more efficient-equipment and appliances , research and development , tax-incentives , and additional-government-programs - all relative to the reference-case . the increased costs are coupled with credits for reductions in fuel-use and productivity-gains from technology . the economic-impact of each scenario is reported in two ways . the first is as a change in household personal-consumption , measuring the goods and services available for consumers to enjoy after subtracting these net-expenditures . the second is as a change in economic-output measured as gross domestic product ( gdp ) . the amiga model reasonably captures those costs and benefits noted above that arise in market-transactions . some , such as loss of flexibility and adjustment-costs on the cost-side , and health-benefits and spillovers on the benefit-side , remain beyond the scope of this analysis . 2 . multi-emissions-analysis this section provides additional-details about the technology-assumptions that underpin the four emission-scenarios . it also describes the results of the scenario-analysis , both in terms of the various marginal-costs associated with emission-control-strategies and the economy-wide-impact of each scenario . although epa made every effort to calibrate amiga to the aeo2001-reference-case , amiga is a different-modeling-system than eia 's national-energy modeling-system ( nems ) . hence , it was not possible to reproduce the exact aeo2001-reference-case the larger macroeconomic-system , the model can then generate key outputs including projected electricity-sales and net-generation , resulting-emissions for each of the four pollutants under consideration , and the set of energy and permit prices associated with the resulting-production-levels . finally , amiga can provide an estimate of the consequent-impact on the economy including-key indicators as consumption , investment , government-spending , gdp , and employment ( hanson , 1999 ) . for more background on the amiga model , see appendix 5.1. projections . moreover , argonne-researchers recently upgraded amiga to incorporate so2 , nox , and mercury-emissions . for this and other reasons , amiga currently reports results only through the year 2015 . nonetheless , the differences in the resulting-baseline projections are minor for the purposes of this analysis . 2.1 . modeling-technology-assumptions scenarios a and b are based on the aeo2001-standard and advanced-technology characteristics , respectively . the standard-technology assumptions of scenario a were used by eia in the development of the aeo2001 `` reference-case '' projections . the advanced-technology-assumptions of scenario b were used as a sensitivity-analysis in the aeo2001 . they demonstrated the effects of earlier availability , lower costs , and/or higher efficiencies for more advanced-equipment than the reference case.3 scenarios c and d are based on the recently published doe-sponsored-report , scenarios for a clean-energy-future ( interlaboratory working-group , 2000 ; see also , brown , et al , 2001 ) . both of the cef scenarios assumed nationwide-restructuring of the electric-utility-industry . from an analytical-perspective , this means that prices are based on the marginal-costs of generation , transmission and distribution of electricity rather than the regulated , cost-of-service-pricing now used throughout much of the country . moreover , both scenarios reflected increased spending for research and development and other programs designed to accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon , energy-efficient-technologies . each of the scenario-assumptions are described more fully in the sections that follow . 2.1.1 . reference-case scenario the scenario a reference-case assumes a `` business-as-usual '' characterization of technology-development and deployment . as projected in the aeo2001 assessment , the nation 's economy is projected to grow at 2.9 % per year in the period 2000 through 2020 . given anticipated-energy-prices and the availability of standard technologies , the nation 's primary-energy-use is expected to grow 1.3 % annually while electricity-consumption is projected to increase by 1.8 % annually . further details are provided in appendix 5.2.1 . 2.1.2 . advanced-technology scenario under the aeo 2001 advanced-technology-characterization , scenario b assumes that a large number of technologies have earlier availability , lower costs , and/or higher efficiencies . for example , the high efficiency-air-conditioners in the commercial-sector are assumed to cost less than in scenario a . this encourages a greater rate of market-penetration as electricity-prices rise in response to the emissions-caps . building-shell-efficiencies in scenario b are assumed to improve by about 50 percent faster than in scenario a . the aeo2001 was published in december 2000 ( energy information administration , 2000 ) . on the utility 's side of the meter , the heat-rates for new combined cycle-power-plants are assumed to be less compared to the standard-case-assumptions . this means that more kilowatthours of electricity are generated for every unit of energy consumed by the power plants . moreover , wood-supply-increases by about 10 % and the capacity-factor of wind energy systems increases by about 15-20 % compared to the reference-case-assumptions . in the aeo2001-report , the combination of higher efficiencies and earlier availability of the technologies lowers the growth in electricity-use from 1.8 % in the reference-case to 1.6 % . 2.1.3 . cef moderate case scenario the authors of the clean-energy-future ( cef ) report describe their analysis as an attempt to `` assess how energy-efficient and clean-energy-technologies can address key-energy and environmental-challenges facing the us '' ( brown , et al , 2001 ) . in that regard , they evaluated a set of about 50 policies to improve the technology performance and characterization of the residential , commercial , industrial , transportation , and electricity-generation-sectors . the policies include increased research and development-funding , equipment-standards , financial-incentives , voluntary-programs , and other regulatory-initiatives . these policies were assumed to change business and consumer-behavior , result in new technological improvements , and expand the success of voluntary and information-programs . the selection of policies in the cef study began with a sector-by-sector-assessment of market-failures and institutional barriers to the market-penetration of clean-energy-technologies in the us . for buildings , the policies and programs include additional appliance-efficiency-standards ; expansion of technical-assistance and technology-deployment-programs ; and an increased number of building-codes and efficiency-standards for equipment and appliances . they also include tax-incentives to accelerate the market-penetration of new technologies and the strengthening of market-transformation-programs such as rebuild america and energy star-labeling . they further include so-called-public-benefits programs enhanced by electricity-line-charges . for industry , the policies include voluntary-agreements with industry-groups to achieve defined energy efficiency and emissions goals , combined with a variety of government-programs that strongly support such agreements . these programs include expansion and strengthening of existing-information-programs , financial-incentives , and energy-efficiency-standards on motors-systems . policies in the cef analysis were assumed to encourage the diffusion and improve the implementation of combined heat and power ( chp ) in the industrial-sector . for electricity , the policies include extending the production-tax-credit of 1.5 cents/kwh over more years and extending it to additional-renewable technologies . broadly speaking , the cef moderate-scenario can be thought of as a 50 % increase in funding for programs that promote a variety of both demand-side and supply-side-technologies . for example , the moderate-scenario assumes a 50 % or $ 1.4 billion increase in cost-shared-research , development , and demonstration of efficient and clean-energy-technologies ( in 1999 dollars with half as federal-appropriations and half as private-sector-cost-share ) . it further assumes a careful-targeting of funds to critical-research-areas and a gradual , 5-year ramp-up of funds to allow for careful-planning , assembly of research-teams , and expansion of existing-teams and facilities . in addition , the cef moderate-scenario anticipates increased-program spending of $ 3.0 and $ 6.6 billion for the years 2010 and 2020 , respectively . these expenditures include production incentives and investment-tax-credits for renewable energy , energy efficiency and transportation-technologies . they further include increased spending for programs such as doe 's industrial assessment centers and epa 's energy star programs . the combined-effect of the r & d and program-expenditures , together with other policies described in the cef report , implies a steady-reduction in total-energy-requirements over the period 2000 through 2020 . by the year 2020 , for example , primary-energy consumption and electricity-sales were projected to decrease by 8 % and 10 % , respectively , compared to the cef reference-case . 2.1.4 . cef advanced-technology scenario building on the policies of the moderate-scenario , the cef advanced-scenario assumes a doubling of cost-shared r & d investments , resulting in an increased spending of $ 2.9 billion per year ( again , in 1999 dollars with half as federal-appropriations and half as private-sector-cost-share ) . in addition , the advanced-scenario anticipates increased-program spending of $ 9.0 and $ 13.2 billion for the years 2010 and 2020 , respectively . the added spending covers all sectors including-buildings , industry , transportation , and electric-generation . the combined-effect of the program and r & d expenditures , together with other policies described in the cef report ( including a $ 50-carbon-charge applied in the cef advanced-scenario ) , drove a steady-reduction in the need for energy compared to the cef reference-case . by 2020 total-energy-use fell by 19 % compared to the reference-case . at the same time , electricity-sales in 2020 were projected to decrease by 24 % compared to the cef reference-case . 2.1.5 . implementation of the technology-assumptions the assumptions embedded in each of these scenarios have the effect of progressively increasing-market-penetration of higher performance-energy-efficiency and energy-supply-technologies . as shown in table 2 , the net-effect of these assumptions is to lower the expected level of electricity-consumption while continuing to meet the same level of service demanded by utility-customers . the technology-assumptions also have the effect of increasing the availability of cleaner energy-supply-technologies that reduce the level of emissions per kilowatt-hour of generation . the critical assumption used in the epa analysis is that program-spending affects both supply and demand-technologies in a way that interacts with the emission-caps that are to be imposed in 2007 . benchmarked to the year 2010 , table 2 shows the percentage-change of key-indicators for each scenario with respect to its respective-reference-case . these changes provide epa with approximate-targets so that each of the scenarios can be mapped into the amiga model . as such , the figures in table 2 should be seen as inputs into the amiga model , not outputs of the model . table 2 . influence of technology-assumptions on key-scenario indicators - 2010 by definition , scenario a assumes the standard-technology assumptions of the aeo2001-reference-case . hence , there are no additional-programs or policies that generate changes in the reference-case-technologies when the emission-caps are imposed by the year 2007 . the level of technology-responsiveness grows for scenarios b , c , and d as a result of greater program-spending . the cef advanced-scenario , for example , assumes a significant-increase in program-funds to promote a variety of both demand-side and supply-side-technologies . as a result of this greater level of program-activity , there is an accelerated penetration of energy-efficient-technologies that drives electricity-sales down by 6.8 percent in 2010 ( compared to the cef reference-case for that same year ) . at the same time , the combination of a lower demand for electricity and an increased investment in cleaner energy-supply-technologies reduces both carbon and nox-emissions by 10.7 and 8.1 percent , respectively ( again , compared to the cef 2010 reference-case ) . as epa modeled this scenario , the bundle of policies in the cef advanced-scenario became , in effect , a complement to the emission-caps imposed by 2007 . to avoid overestimating the impact of the policy-scenarios in this analysis , epa made a number of adjustments before implementing the cef assumptions in the four scenarios reported here . first , the cef analysis was benchmarked to a 1999-reference-case . in the aeo2001-reference-case , however , the demand for electricity in 2020 is about 10 % higher compared to the cef reference-case . second , the senate request asked epa to assume a 2002-start-date in running the technology and policy-scenarios . in effect , there are fewer years in which programs can achieve the desired level of technology improvement compared to the cef scenarios . in addition , the cef analysis includes a significant-review of transportation-technologies and policies . epa chose to exclude all assumptions related to transportation , focusing only on the supply and demand-side-technologies associated with electricity and natural gas-consumption . with the adjustments described above now reflected in the current analytical-framework , and using the program-cost information documented in the cef study , table 3 summarizes the incremental-program-costs that were assumed as necessary to drive the kind of changes in electricity-consumption and emissions described in table 2 . since transportation-programs drove a significant-part of the cef expenditures , and since there are fewer years to implement policies , the estimated-program-expenditures are also smaller compared to the cef assumptions . table 3 . incremental-policy-costs of the technology-scenarios ( billion 1999 dollars ) because scenario a characterizes existing-program and technology performance , no additional-funds are required to drive that scenario . scenario b , on the other hand , anticipates some changes in the technology-characterization that will affect the electricity-sector as shown in table 2 . while the aeo2001-analysis anticipated no program-spending to drive these changes , epa assumed that additional-spending would be required for scenario b. calibrating to the cef policy-scenarios , epa estimated that program and policy-spending would increase by $ 0.8 billion in 2002 , rising steadily to $ 2.9 billion by 2015 . for scenario c , program-spending increased by $ 1.2 billion starting in 2002 , rising to $ 4.8 billion by 2015 . finally , program-spending in scenario d started at $ 2.1 billion in 2002 and increased to $ 5.5 billion by the last year of this analysis.4 the net-effect of mapping increased-program spending together with adjustments needed to update the assumptions of the cef policy-scenarios can be highlighted by reviewing the change in electricity-generation for scenario d. in the cef advanced-scenario ( based on a 1999-reference-case ) , for example , the level of electricity-generation in 2010 was lowered by 10 % from the reference-case requirements of 3,920 billion kilowatt-hours ( kwh ) . as the cef technology-assumptions were applied in scenario d within this analysis ( updated to the aeo2001-reference-case ) , electricity-generation was reduced by 9 % from 4,253 billion ( kwh ) . the trend was more pronounced in 2015 . rather than a roughly 16 % reduction from a generation-level of 4,200 billion kwh in the 1999 cef advanced case , the scenario d equivalent in this analysis achieved only a 12 % reduction from a generation of 4,580 billion kwh . 2.1.6 . reasonableness of the scenario-assumptions the results of the technology-driven-scenarios should not be interpreted as an epa endorsement of any of the policies or technology-assumptions behind each of scenarios described in this report . on the one hand , epa has not conducted any significant-review of the eia assumptions that underpin the aeo2001 projections . on the other hand , some analysts do not necessarily agree with the assumptions and projected level of impacts in the cef assessment despite the fact that it was peer-reviewed and its findings published this fall in an academic-journal . the eia ( 2001 ) , for example , notes that the cef policies assume changes in consumer-behavior that are not consistent with historically observed-behavior-patterns . moreover , the eia suggests that there is little-documentation to support the assumed technological improvements generated by the research and development ( r & d ) initiatives described in the report . finally , eia notes that the program-spending-assumptions developed in this analysis are used only to approximate the impact of the cef scenario s. they do not reflect epa endorsement of these spending-levels . the effectiveness of voluntary or information-programs may be less than assumed in the cef scenarios . at the same time , the lead cef analysts have responded to the eia assertions by citing relevant economic-literature and noting that the cef study is one of `` the most carefully documented and complete-analysis of u.s. energy-futures that has ever been funded by the u.s. government '' ( koomey , et al , 2001 ) . notwithstanding these concerns , epa attempted to respond to the senators ' request by mapping in the critical-assumptions of the cef as a range of policies that provide a set of alternative-assumptions about the future . in this regard , the scenarios are more like descriptions of alternative future-outcomes rather than predictions or recommendations about how the future should unfold . to provide a more complete-context for understanding the magnitude of the changes in electricity-generation that are suggested by the different-scenarios , the figure below illustrates both the historical and projected-trends in the nation's electricity-generation . the information is shown as the number of kwh per dollar of gdp ( measured in constant 1999 dollars ) . the historical-data covers the period 1970 through 2000 while the projected-trends are through the year 2015 . the historical-period shows a moderate-level of volatility . the reference-case projections suggest an annual rate of declining-intensity of 1.6 % per year through 2015 with a final-value 0.33 kwh/ $ . historical and projected us electricity trends ( kwh per 1999 $ gdp ) 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 in comparison to the reference-case , scenario d ( adapting the cef advanced case assumptions ) reflects a national-commitment to improve both electricity-supply and the efficiency of demandside technologies . the presumption is that such a commitment would be supported by a significant-increase in r & d and program-spending as described above . under these assumptions , the nation's electricity-intensity is projected to decline at an annual rate of 2.5 % , dropping to a final-intensity of 0.28 kwh/ $ . this level of decline is greater than previously seen in the recent-past . in the period 1980 through 1986 , for example , and again 1993 through 2000 , the annual rate of decline was only 1.7 percent . hence , it appears that the assumptions driving the advanced-scenario are aggressive . at the same time , however , the research undertaken by the cef analysts indicates that the technology is available to achieve such a reduction should a national-commitment be successful in driving similar-policies . 2.2 . results of the scenario-analysis with the model benchmarked to aeo2001 , and given the different-mix of scenario-assumptions previously described , amiga reports the results in the figures and tables that follow . more complete-data , including reference-case-assumptions , are available in appendix 5.2 . 2.2.1 . emission-projections all program and policy-assumptions have a start-date of 2002 . moreover , the analysis anticipates the use of banked-allowances made possible by early-emissions-reductions achieved in the years 2002 through 2006 ( as requested in the senate letter ) . figures 1 through 4 on the following-page illustrate both the emissions-projections and the impact of banking the early-reductions on all four emissions-caps implemented in 2007 . although all four categories of emissions are down substantially , they only achieve 50-75 % of the proposed cap by 2007 ( shown as the dotted horizontal-line in each of the above figures ) . this is because of the availability of the banked-allowances that can be used by sources to meet emissions-caps in 2007 and beyond . note that costs would be noticeably higher if power plants were required to actually hit the target in 2007 . in 2015 , carbon and mercury-emissions continue to be 15 % or more above the target . the reductions that generate the banked-allowances are shown as the area to the left of each vertical dotted-line as the differences between the reference-case and scenario-emission trajectories . the emissions above the cap are shown to the right of each vertical dotted-line and between the scenario-emissions and the dotted horizontal-line . subtracting these two areas on each graph reveals the level of the bank in 2015 . using-scenario d as an example , the remaining-allowances in 2015 are 100 million metric-tons for carbon , 1.3 million tons for so2 , 0.2 million tons for nox and 25 tons for mercury . in the case of carbon , the bank would last another two years at the rate of drawdown in 2015 , or longer if the drawdown declined . figure 1 . carbon emissions ( million metric-tons ) figure 2 . so2 emissions ( million tons ) figure 3 . nox-emissions ( million tons ) figure 4 . mercury-emissions ( tons ) 2.2.2 . changes in electric-generation expenditures given the assumptions and economic-drivers in each of the scenarios , the amiga model calculates the capital investment , operation and maintenance , and fuel costs necessary to meet consumer demand for electricity . the incremental-expenditures required to generate electricity under each of the four scenarios as compared to the reference-case are summarized in figure 5 ( in billions of 1999 dollars ) . in effect , the incremental-expenditures reflect the range of decisions made by the electricity-sector to comply with each of the four scenario-constraints-but do not reflect efforts made outside the electricity-sector . because these expenditures ignore spending on energy efficiency , research and development outside the electricity-sector-spending that can be substantial-they are not measures of program-costs . note that incremental-expenditures are incurred as early as 2002 in all four scenarios to generate early-reductions that can be banked for use in 2007 and beyond . the generation-expenditures vary in each of the scenarios-change for at least three reasons : ( 1 ) the size of the allowance-bank made possible by early-reductions driven , in part , by program-spending prior to the introduction of the caps ; ( 2 ) the varying-levels of demand for electricity over time , resulting in changes in the overall-mix of generation-resources ; and , ( 3 ) the gradual-reduction in the banked-allowances available for withdrawal-necessitating additional-actions to reduce emissions . as expected , scenario a has the largest increase with expenditures rising by nearly $ 17 billion in 2015 compared to the reference-case . the higher level of expenditures is driven by a 21 % increase in unit-generation-costs caused primarily by the emissions-caps and offset only slightly by a small-decrease in electricity-demand . with less energy-efficiency-technology penetrating the market , a greater level of control-equipment must be installed and operated which , in turn , drives up the cost of generation . scenario b follows a similar-pattern with expenditure-increases being offset by further reductions in electricity-demand as more efficient technology penetrates the market . the expenditures for scenario c decline even further as reduced-demand continues to lower both the level-generation and the unit-cost of that generation compared to scenario a . scenario d , on the other hand , actually shows a decline in total-expenditures by 2015 . the combination of a 12.5 % reduction on generation-load together with only an 11.9 % increase in the unit-cost of generation ( both with respect to the reference-case ) results in a $ 3.11 billion reduction in total electric-generation expenditures . figure 5 . incremental-expenditures on electric-generation ( billions of 1999 $ ) 2.2.3 . marginal-costs the marginal-costs of emission-reductions over the period 2005 through 2015 are shown in figures 6 through 9 for all four scenarios . figure 6 . projected marginal-cost of carbon-reductions ( $ /metric ton ) figure 7 . projected marginal-cost of so2 reductions ( $ /ton ) figure 8 . projected marginal-cost of nox reductions ( $ /ton ) figure 9 . projected marginal-cost of hg reductions ( $ million/ton ) the marginal-cost of carbon-reductions range from $ 46 to $ 138/metric ton through 2015 with each scenario showing successively smaller costs as technology-characteristics improve and more energy-efficient and/or low-carbon-technologies penetrate the market . the marginal-cost of so2 and nox reductions through 2015 are less than $ 450/ and $ 2,300/ton , respectively , in all four multi-emissions-reduction-scenarios . the marginal-cost of mercury-reductions by 2015 ranges from $ 350 million/ton to $ 432 million/ton , again depending on the scenario . it is important to note that marginal-cost reflects the additional-cost of one more ton of reductions , and not the total-cost associated with each pollutant . one can make a very rough estimation of this overall-cost for each pollutant , on top of the costs associated with the other three , by multiplying half the marginal-cost ( to approximate average-cost ) by the volume of reductions . by 2015 , as an example , scenario a returns-cost estimates of $ 15.2 billion for carbon , $ 1.1 billion for so2 , $ 2.7 billion for nox , and $ 6.4 billion for mercury . in scenario d , the cost-estimates are $ 8.6 billion for carbon , $ 1.6 billion for so2 , $ 3.3 billion for nox , and $ 7.8 billion for mercury . note that these figures can not be added together for an overall-estimate because they ( a ) double count the benefits of controlling multiple-pollutants simultaneously , and ( b ) ignore the consequences of the underlying-technology-policy . we discuss overall-costs below . surprisingly , the marginal-cost of so2 , nox , and hg reductions increases as the marginal-cost of carbon-decreases . the reason appears to be that as efficiency-technology penetrates the market and reduces carbon-prices , more of a price-signal is required to generate further reductions in the three conventional-pollutants . in the advanced-scenarios , for example , both demand-reductions and the increased use of gas tends to reduce carbon emissions . but gas prices begin to rise which allows coal to make a modest-comeback with respect to scenario a . this is especially-true as cleaner and more efficient-coal-technologies begin to penetrate the market as assumed in scenarios b through d. in order to offset the tendency for coal-generated-emissions to increase , permit prices need to adjust upward . 2.2.4 . fuel-use-impacts figure 10 shows both total-electricity-consumption and the fossil-fuel-consumption used in the generation of electricity for the year 2010 . the results are in quadrillion btu in both the reference-case and each of the four policy-scenarios . as each successive-scenario generates a greater reduction in electricity-demand , coal-use is reduced significantly ( by about 30 percent ) . gas-consumption-increases slightly in scenarios a and b , and decreases by a small amount in scenarios c and d as lower electricity-consumption reduces the need for new capacity . figure 10 . total-electricity-consumption and fossil-fuel generation in 2010 ( quadrillion btu ) 2.2.5 . energy price impacts the model suggests that under the conditions described above , electricity-prices are expected to increase by about 30 % ( under scenario d ) to 50 % ( under scenario a ) by the year 2015 . this is the logical-result of increased control-costs and permit prices . the combination of increased prices and the availability of more energy-efficient-equipment and appliances reduce electricity-demand by about 10 % . total-electricity-expenditures increase by about 15 % to 30 % depending on the year and the scenario ( see table 3 , below , and the tables in appendix 5.2 for more detail on the changing pattern of expenditures ) . 2.2.6 . economy-wide-impacts table 3 provides a summary of key macroeconomic-data for the year 2010 to compare the impact of emissions-reductions on both personal-consumption and other components of gross domestic product ( gdp ) . the effects on personal-consumption show a decline of between $ 13 billion and $ 31 , or 0.1 % to 0.3 % , depending on the scenario . this reflects the cost of the program in terms of the decreased well being of households who must forego a fraction of their consumption of goods and services in order to pay for both research and development-programs , energy-efficiency-improvements , and more expensive-electricity-production . table 3 shows little change in gdp under any of the policy-scenarios , reflecting the fact that this foregone-consumption turns up as expenditures in other categories of gdp , namely , investment and government spending.5 table 3 . summary of economic-impacts by scenario - 2010 the amiga-modeling-system reports the costs and benefits of each scenario with several major-exceptions . the first omitted-benefit is spillover and productivity-gains beyond energy-bill-savings . a number of studies suggest that energy-efficiency-technology investments also tend to increase overall-productivity of the economy , especially in the industrial-sector . ( sullivan , et al. , 1997 ; finman and laitner , 2001 ; and laitner , et al , 2001 ) . to date , however , no systematic-effort has been undertaken to incorporate such benefits into the current-generation of policy-models . hence , this potential-benefit is not reported at this time . the second missing-benefit includes gains in environmental-quality , especially improved health-benefits . on the cost-side , the model ignores costs associated with rapid changes in capital-stocks , as well as potential-loss of flexibility and interactions with the existing-tax-system . for example , the model forecasts significant-changes in the level and composition of electricity-generation in 2002 , ignoring the difficulty of rapidly changing the capital-stock by then end of 2001 . losses in flexibility occur when pollution-control-activities potentially interfere with efficiency and other operational-programs at a regulated facility . finally , there are interactions with the tax-system when , in response to a rise in the relative-cost of purchased goods , people decide to enjoy more a more complete-assessment of each policy-scenario can be made by reviewing the more detailed-data contained in the appendix . leisure ( which is now relatively less expensive ) , work less , and lower taxable-income ( parry and oates , 2000 ) . 2.3 . the results in context recent-studies suggest significant economic-consequences as a result of substantial emission-reduction strategies ( epri , 2000 ; and eia , 2000 ) . on the other hand , the presumption of a trade-off between environmental and economic-benefits may not provide an entirely appropriate-framework for analysis of such policies ( decanio , 1997 ) . indeed , there are a number of studies that show net economic-benefits may be possible when a full-accounting of both benefits and costs are included within an appropriate-analysis ( krause , et al , 2001 ; and bailie , et al , 2001 ) . at the same time , understanding the proper-characterization and role of technology-improvements ( edmonds , et al , 2000 ) , and then capturing that characterization within an appropriate-model structure ( peters , et al , 2001 ) , is a critical-aspect of all such economic-assessments . finally , it is important to recognize that the mere-existence of technologies and the potential for positive-net-benefits does not assure that these technologies will be commercialized and adopted , nor that the net-benefits will be realized ( jaffe , et al , 2001 ) . an unanswered-question is whether and how policies might encourage these activities . this current-study , while drawing on credible-data-sources and applying a state-of-the-art-modeling-system , can not adequately capture all such nuances associated with emission-reduction scenarios . the results of this analysis should be viewed within this larger context . 3 . conclusions the analysis suggests that under the conditions described above , emissions through 2015 will be significantly reduced although they wo n't meet the 2007 target . this is largely because of assumptions about the banking of allowances earned prior to 2007 . at the same time , coal-fired-electric generation is expected to decline by 25 % to 35 % by the year 2015 . on the other hand , oil and gas-fired-generation is projected to increase by about 8 % under more restrictive-technology-assumptions , but decrease by as much as 20 % under scenarios that embody more optimistic-assumptions about energy-efficiency-demand and supply-technologies . electricity-prices are expected to increase by 32 % to 50 % in 2015 , depending on the scenario . the combination of increased prices and the availability of more energy-efficient-equipment and appliances are projected to reduce electricity-demand by about 10 % compared to the reference-case . with the combination of higher prices and improved efficiency , total-expenditures for electricity-consumption in 2015 are projected to increase by about 17 % to 39 % depending on the scenario . interacting with other changes in consumer and business spending that is driven by each of the scenario-assumptions , the personal-consumption reduced by about 0.1 % to 0.3 % . this again depends on the year and the scenario . the results provided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts of actual-scenario-outcomes . rather they are assessments of how the future might unfold compared to a previously defined reference-case - given the mix of technology and policy-assumptions embodied in each of the scenarios . the results from these scenarios imply a strong national-commitment , one that is successful in developing the programs and policies necessary to achieve the level of emission-reductions described within the report . 4 . references alison , bailie , stephen bernow , william dougherty , michael lazarus , and sivan kartha , 2001 . the american way to the kyoto protocol : an economic-analysis to reduce carbon pollution , tellus institute and stockholm environment institute , boston , ma , july , 2001 . brown , marilyn a. , mark d. levine , walter short , and jonathan g. koomey , 2001 . `` scenarios for a clean-energy-future , '' energy-policy vol . 29 ( november ) : 1179-1196 , 2001 . decanio , stephen j. , 1997 . `` economic-modeling and the false tradeoff between environmental-protection and economic growth , '' contemporary economic policy , vol . 15 ( october ) : 10-27 , 1997 . edmonds , jae , joseph m. roop , and michael j. scott , 2000 . technology and the economics of climate-change-policy , pew center on global-climate-change , washington , dc , september 2000 . e-grid , 2000 . emissions & generation resource integrated database , us environmental-protection agency , washington , dc , http : //www.epa.gov/airmarkets/egrid/factsheet.html . electric-power research institute , 2000 . energy-environment policy integration and coordination study , tr-1000097 , palo alto , ca , 2000 . energy information administration , 1998 . impacts of the kyoto protocol on u.s. energy markets and economic activity , sr/oiaf/98-03 , washington , dc , october 1998 . energy information administration , 2000 . analysis of strategies for reducing multiple-emissions from power plants : sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , and carbon dioxide , sr/oiaf/2000-05 ( washington , dc , december 2000 ) . energy information administration , 2001 . analysis of strategies for reducing multiple-emissions from electric-power-plants with advanced-technology-scenarios , sr/oiaf/2001-05 ( washington , dc , october 2001 ) . finman , hodayah , and john a . `` skip '' laitner , 2001 . `` industry , energy efficiency and productivity-improvements , '' proceedings of the aceee industrial summer study , american council for an energy-efficient-economy , washington , dc , august 2001 . hanson , donald a , 1999 . a framework for economic-impact-analysis and industry growth assessment : description of the amiga system , decision and information sciences division , argonne national laboratory , argonne , il , april , 1999 . interlaboratory working-group , 2000 . scenarios for a clean-energy-future , ornl/con-476 and lbnl-44029 oak ridge , tn : oak ridge national laboratory ; berkeley , ca : lawrence berkeley national laboratory , november 2000 . jaffe , ab , rn newell , and rn stavins , 2001 . `` energy-efficient-technologies and climate-change-policies : issues and evidence .

2 ) . explicit-technology-representation - amiga reads in files with detailed-lists of technologies ( currently with a focus on energy-efficient and low-carbon energy-supply-technologies , including electric-generating-units ) containing-performance characteristics , availability-status , costs , anticipated learning effects , and emission-rates where appropriate ; 3 ) . computable general equilibrium - amiga computes a full-employment-solution for demands , prices , costs , and outputs of interrelated-products , including induced activities such as transportation and wholesale/retail trade ; 4 ) . macroeconomic - amiga calculates national-income , gross domestic product ( gdp ) , employment , a comprehensive-list of consumption-goods and services , the trade-balance , and net foreign-assets and examines inflationary pressures ; 5 ) . economic growth - amiga projects economic-growth-paths and long-term , dynamic-effects of alternative-investments including accumulation of residential , vehicle , and producer-capital stocks . in addition , the amiga system includes the argonne-unit-planning and compliance-model that captures a wide variety of technology-characteristics within the electric-generating-sector . this includes a system dispatch-routine that allows the retirement and the dispatch of units on the basis of traditional-cost-criteria as well as the impact of various-permit-prices on operating costs . it also includes non-utility-generation-sources such as industrial combined heat and power-applications and renewable energy systems . climate-change mitigation policy has been the main-application of the amiga system to date . but the amiga-modeling-system recently has been enhanced to include policies involving the reduction of sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxide , and mercury-emissions . moreover , a new intertemporal-optimization-module has been added to amiga that allows an evaluation of early-reductions and the banking of allowances to be incorporated into policy-scenarios . hence , the system is well suited to evaluate a variety of multi-emission strategies that are driven by price-incentives as well as r & d programs , voluntary-initiatives , and cap-and-trade policies . because of recent-upgrades and enhancements made in the model , the current-reporting-period is extended only through the year 2015 . we expect the full-reporting-period to extend back to the year 2030 in the very near-future . the model includes a complete-database of all electric-utility generating-units within the united states . the cost and performance-characteristics of the electricity-supply-technologies generally follow those modeled within the energy information administration's national-energy modeling-system . the characteristics associated with the various emission-control technologies generally follow those modeled within the integrated planning model used by the environmental-protection agency . the amiga-modeling-system is a highly organized , flexible structure that is programmed in the c language . it includes modules for household-demand , production of goods , motor-vehicles , electricity-supply , and residential and commercial-buildings and appliances . the production modules contain representations of labor , capital , and energy-substitutions using a hierarchy of production functions . the adoption-rates for cost-effective-technologies depend on energy prices as well as policies and programs that lower the implicit-discount-rates ( sometimes referred to as hurdle-rates ) that are used by households and businesses to evaluate energy-efficiency and energy-supply measures.7 for a more complete-documentation of the amiga model , see hanson , donald a , 1999 . a framework for economic-impact-analysis and industry growth assessment : description of the amiga system , decision and information sciences division , argonne national laboratory , argonne , il , april , 1999 . for an example of other policy-excursions using the amiga model , see , hanson , donald a. and john a . `` skip '' laitner , 2000 , `` an economic-growth-model with investment , energy savings , and co2 reductions , '' proceedings of the air & waste-management association , salt lake city , june 18-22 , 2000 . also see , laitner , john a . `` skip '' , kathleen hogan , and donald hanson , `` technology and greenhouse-gas emissions : an integrated analysis of policies that increase investments in cost effective energy-efficient-technologies , '' proceedings of the electric-utilities environment conference , tucson , az , january 1999 . 5.2 . summary-tables for study scenarios 5.2.1 . reference-case projections 5.2.2 . scenario a : emission-constraints using-reference-case technologies 5.2.3 . scenario b : emission-constraints using advanced case technologies 5.2.4 . scenario c : emission-constraints using the moderate cef scenario-assumptions 5.2.5 . scenario d : emission-constraints using the advanced cef scenario-assumptions
