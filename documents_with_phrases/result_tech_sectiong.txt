section g : summary of the models used for the analysis description of the integrated planning model ( ipm ) analytical-framework of ipm • epa uses the integrated planning model ( ipm ) to analyze the projected-impact of environmental-policies on the electric-power-sector in the 48-contiguous-states and the district of columbia . developed by icf resources incorporated and used to support public and private-sector-clients , ipm is a multi-regional , dynamic , deterministic linear-programming-model of the u.s. electric-power-sector . • the model provides forecasts of least-cost-capacity expansion , electricity-dispatch , and emission-control-strategies for meeting-energy-demand and environmental , transmission , dispatch , and reliability-constraints . ipm can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions-impacts of proposed policies to limit emissions of sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) , carbon dioxide ( co2 ) , and mercury ( hg ) from the electric-power-sector . • ipm was a key analytical-tool in developing the president's clear skies proposal . ipm is well suited to model multi-emission control-programs • among the factors that make ipm particularly well suited to model multi-emissions control-programs are ( 1 ) its ability to capture complex-interactions among the electric-power , fuel , and environmental-markets , ( 2 ) its detail-rich-representation of emission-control-options encompassing a broad-array of retrofit technologies along with emission-reductions through fuel-switching , changes in capacity-mix , and electricity-dispatch-strategies , and ( 3 ) its capability to model a variety of environmental-market-mechanisms , such as emissions-caps , allowances , trading , and banking . • ipm is particularly well suited for modeling clear skies because the program relies on the operation of an allowance-market , the availability of a broad-range of emissions-reduction-options , and empowerment of economic-actors to achieve emission-limits . extensive-documentation of the ipm is available at http : //www.epa.gov/airmarkets/epa-ipm/index.html . description of air-quality-modeling • the results for fine-particle-concentrations , visibility , sulfur-deposition , and nitrogen-deposition are based on the regional-modeling-system for aerosols and deposition ( remsad ) . • remsad is an eulerian-air-quality model developed to simulate regional-scale-distributions , sources , formation , transport , and removal-processes for fine-particles and other airborne-pollutants . this analysis used remsad version 6.4 with meteorological-inputs previously developed for 1996 using the mesoscale meteorological model ( mm-5 ) . • the results for ozone-concentrations are based on the comprehensive air-quality-model with extensions ( camx ) . • camx is an eulerian-air-quality model developed to simulate local and regional-scale-distributions , sources , formation transport , and removal-processes for ozone and other photochemical pollutants . this analysis used camx version 3.1 with meteorological-inputs previously developed using the regional atmospheric modeling-system ( rams ) for episodes in june , july , and august 1995 . • the integrated planning model ( ipm ) was used to derive all future-projections of electricity-generation source emissions . • emissions-inputs for non-electric-generating-facilities for remsad and camx were derived from the 1996 national-emissions inventory ( nei ) . in addition , inventories prepared for the heavy-duty diesel engine rulemaking were the basis for future-year emissions-projections . • for the most part , the modeling-results are analyzed in terms of the change in future-year air-quality relative to predictions under baseline-conditions . in this way , effects of any uncertainties in emissions-forecasts and air-quality-modeling are minimized . • results for projected annual pm2.5 and 8-hour ozone nonattainment were determined by `` rolling back '' current-air-quality levels . this was based on the change in air-quality between the 1996 base-year and each future-year-scenario . since no ozone-modeling was performed for the western u.s. , future-ozone nonattainment in the west was determined through an emissions scaling-analysis that used-forecast-changes in nox-emissions in the west coupled with the response of ozone to emissions-changes , as modeled in the east . • maps which display the impacts on pm2.5 concentrations and deposition are reported as a percent-reduction . a positive-percent reduction ( e.g . 30 % ) is a decrease in concentration or deposition compared to current-conditions ( an improvement ) ; a negative-percent reduction ( e.g . -30 % ) is an increase in concentration or deposition compared to current-conditions . • visibility-results are reported as a change in deciviews . `` perfect '' visibility is represented by a deciview of zero , so a decrease in deciview is an increase or improvement in visibility . an increase in deciview is a decrease in visibility . description of benefits modeling • the criteria air-pollutant modeling-system ( capms ) is used to quantify human-health-benefits due to the changes in a population's exposure to fine particulate-matter and ozone . • using the air-quality-modeling results , the change in pollutant-concentration based on modeling for each capms grid-cell is determined . this is the level at which the population living in that grid-cell is assumed to be exposed . • concentration-response-functions from epidemiological-studies are applied to each grid-cell to predict the changes in incidences of health-outcomes ( e.g . asthma-attacks ) that would occur with the projected changes in air-quality . • the grid-cells are aggregated to estimate the health-impact of the change in air-quality across the study-region . • the estimated economic-value of an avoided health-outcome ( e.g . $ 41 per asthma-attack-day ) is multiplied by total-change in events to determine the health-benefits of air-quality-improvements for the entire-region . • for visibility , benefits were calculated based on changes in fine-particle-concentrations , presented as deciviews , which are provided by the remsad air-quality-model . • individuals place a value on visibility-improvements in recreational-areas , such as national-parks and wilderness-areas • the economic-value that people place on improved visibility on a day that they visit a class i area is applied to the predicted deciview-changes and projected number of park-visitors affected to attain recreational-visibility monetary-benefits . description of freshwater-modeling • the model of acidification of groundwater in catchments ( magic ) is used to examine changes in surface-freshwater-chemistry as indicated by changes in acid neutralizing-capacity ( anc ) in the waterbody . • anc represents the ability of a lake or stream to neutralize , or buffer , acid . the condition of a lake or stream improves as the the anc increases , moving from chronically-acidic � episodically acidic � not acidic . • episodically acidic-lakes ( anc of 0-50 µeq/l ) have a greater capacity to neutralize acid-deposition than chronically-acidic ones . however , these lakes remain susceptible to becoming chronically-acidic if acid-deposition-increases . • watershed-characteristics ( e.g. , soils , bedrock-type , geologic-history ) affect the rate of water-chemistry-response to acid-deposition . • `` direct-response '' lakes or streams manifest changes more quickly , whereas `` delayed response '' lakes or streams manifest changes over a longer period of time . • magic results show the distribution of lakes and streams ( by percentage ) over the three anc classes • three regions were modeled ( the adirondacks , the northeast ( including the adirondacks ) , and the southeast ) . • results are reported for current-conditions ( 2000 ) and in 2030 under the base case and the clear skies act . results are based on a model called the `` model of acidification of groundwater in catchments '' ( magic ) used by the national acid precipitation assessment program ( napap ) to estimate the long-term effects of acidic-deposition ( sulfur ) on lakes and streams . the model simulates the size of the pool of exchangeable-base-cations in the soil . as the fluxes to and from the pool-change over time due to changes in atmospheric-deposition , the chemical-equilibria between soil and soil-solution-shift to give changes in surface-water-chemistry . changes in surface-water-chemistry are characterized by changes in acid neutralizing-capacity ( anc ) - the ability of a waterbody to neutralize strong-acids added from atmospheric-deposition . description of the technology-retrofit and updating-model uses of the technology-retrofit and updating-model • at this time , ipm does not model price-elasticity of demand and the effect of multiple allowance-allocation mechanisms . to study the effect of these variables on electricity-prices and markets , icf developed a macro-driven-spreadsheet-program termed the `` technology-retrofit and updating-model . '' • the model is used to discern trends in marginal-costs and retrofits , the approximate-magnitudes of those trends , and the reasons for those trends . modeling-approach • the technology-retrofit and updating-model consists of a set of approximately six hundred `` sample '' generating-units with varying characteristics . the mix of generation-types and sizes was chosen to mirror , in general-terms , the nationwide-mix of capacities . each unit is assumed to choose emission-control retrofit-options , fuels , and generation-levels so as to maximize its own net profit in response to fuel prices , emission-allowance-prices , and prices of electricity for various-demand-segments . prices of fuels can be adjusted in the model in response to demand ; prices of electricity by demand-segment is set in the model so as to meet demand ; and allowance-prices can be adjusted to cause the industry to meet given caps . • to simulate the effects of demand-elasticity , the quantity of electricity demanded in each segment can be set as a function of electricity-prices using an elasticity-value that is entered as an input to the model . finally , to simulate the effects of allowance updating , the value of reallocated-allowances can be calculated and subtracted from each unit 's cost of generation - thereby inducing each unit to change its profit-maximizing-level of generation in response to a given set of fuel , allowance , and electricity-prices . readjusting the allowance-prices to meet the same emission-caps then generates results showing the costs of meeting given caps with and without updating . • an important-limitation of this model is that it does not simulate-changes over time in the demand for electricity , prices , technology , or other factors considered within ipm . instead , it is run as though every year is the same as every other year and is therefore-static in its outlook . in addition , it does not recognize the distinctions among electricity-demand-regions and the transmission-constraints that can keep them separate . thus , only one price of electricity is determined for each demand-segment for the entire-set of sample-plants . description of the retail-electricity price model primary-attributes of the model • the model provides a forecast of average retail-electricity prices from 2005 to 2020 for 13 regions and the contiguous u.s. , and considers areas of the country that ( 1 ) will have competitive-pricing of power-generation and , ( 2 ) are likely to price retail power based on a cost-of-service-basis . • combines ipm and eia information with data from the national regulatory research institute and center for advanced-energy markets regarding the restructuring of the power-industry . • `` main case '' is epa 's forecast of `` likely-deregulation '' considering-areas of the country that should price generation services for retail-customers competitively and those that most likely to use cost-of-service-pricing-principles . • the model readily analyzes alternative-multi-pollutant and base-case-scenarios modeled with ipm , alternative-assumptions on deregulation and future savings/costs , and the implications of different allowance-allocation approaches . the strongest application of the calculator occurs from examining the relative-price differences between two or more scenarios . the limitations of the model include • the model combines ipm and eia cost-elements that use similar -- but not identical -- assumptions on capital-recovery and aggregate-cost-data in a similar -- but not identical -- regional manner that needs adjustment . • the model assumes public and private companies seek the same return and have the same tax-treatment , which overstates prices in areas where there are large amounts of public-power . • the model focuses on major-costs . it assumes for cost-of-service-areas ( where most of power-sales are likely to occur ) that allowance-allocations will not alter pricing of electricity . • uses eia 's limited ( but best-available ) data in some areas ( e.g . rate base with stranded assets ) . • the model can not address the uncertainty of deregulation created by california 's experience -- where competition may increase or decrease in the future . with the phasing in of competition and limited-experience , the full-benefits and costs of deregulation still remain unknown .
