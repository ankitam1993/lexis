session 2 . identifying ed patients with alcohol-problems robert woolard , md many patients in the emergency-department ( ed ) have alcohol-problems , and they can be identified.1 research on techniques used to identify these patients has been conducted , but several-areas of interest should be addressed by further research . we need to further examine and refine alcohol-screening-questionnaires in the ed . we need to determine the sequence and combination of questions and tests that constitute the best screening-process . we need to study-barriers to screening , identify factors that promote screening-implementation , and demonstrate the impact of a screening-program in the ed . the final-aim of screening must be improved-outcomes through referral and counseling . identification is only the first step in a process of care . alcohol-problems defined alcohol-problems designate a spectrum from risk-behavior to illness , and from problematic-consumption to alcohol-use-disorder . we must be careful when interpreting the results of studies , and in our own design of screening-procedures , that we are clear about the endpoints we are measuring . clinicians in the ed are interested in screening for several-alcohol-endpoints . acute-intoxication is of concern to emergency-physicians . intoxication in a driver would certainly be considered an `` alcohol-problem . '' the blood or breath alcohol-concentration ( bac ) , coupled with our clinical observations , may help us identify intoxication . most alcohol-screening tests identify patients with alcohol-use-disorders or problematic-consumption of alcohol . the american psychiatric association in dsm iii-r , iv2 and the world health organization ( who ) in the 9th and 10th international classification of diseases ( icd-9 , -10 ) have rigorously defined alcohol-abuse and alcohol dependence.3 these definitions largely agree for dependence , but not for abuse . dsm includes social and legal-consequences of abuse and icd-10 has only medical and psychological-consequences . fewer cases of alcohol-abuse meet the icd-10 definition . in general , an alcohol-use-disorder is present when an aspect of the patient's function has been compromised by alcohol . before function is compromised , problematic-consumption occurs . much of the emphasis of screening has shifted toward identifying-patients with high alcohol-consumption before disease develops . who defines hazardous-drinking as 4 or more drinks/day for men and 2 or more drinks/day for women . the national institute on alcohol-abuse and alcoholism ( niaaa ) defines at-risk-drinking as consumption of more than 14 drinks/week or more than 4 drinks/occasion for men-ages 18 to 65 . for women of all ages and men older than age 65 , more than 7 drinks/week or more than 3 drinks/occasion is considered at risk . binge-drinking alone is also of concern and has been variably defined as more than 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 drinks on an occasion.4 characteristics of an ideal ed screening-test or sequence of tests an ideal-screening-test would be accurate , practical , and motivational . the accuracy of a test can be measured in several-ways . for a screening-test , high sensitivity is the most desirable parameter . high sensitivity ensures that most of the patients with problems will be detected . high specificity is also desirable to help ensure that positive-tests represent real-problems . there is a trade off between sensitivity and specificity defined by the receiver-operator-curve . the area under the operator curve best reflects the performance of a test ; the larger the area the better the test . each point on the curve represents a potential `` cut-point . '' a cut-point with a high sensitivity and specificity should be manifest in an ideal-test . theoretically , an ideal-test should remain accurate throughout the alcohol-use-spectrum . however , real-tests do n't perform uniformly across a spectrum . for example , if we 're interested in identifying-patients with binge-drinking , we can define binge-drinking as 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 drinks on an occasion . screening-tests designed for patients with more severe-problems ( 6 drinks ) will be less sensitive at identifying-patients with less severe-problems ( 3 drinks ) . an ideal-test would perform uniformly in all populations and sub-groups . however , when we screen populations with high case-rates ( trauma-admissions , 63 % ) ,5 a highly-sensitive test with moderate-specificity performs well . the same test used to screen a population with low-case-rates ( pregnant-clinic-patients , 7 % ) 6 does not perform as well . in this population , a test with higher specificity may be needed to avoid too many false-positives . a test that is used to screen a diverse-population ( such as ed patients ) will perform better in some subgroups than others based of the different-case-rates among subgroups . an ideal-test should remain accurate in the presence of common ed problems , such as stress , injury , acute-illness , intoxication , other drug-use , depression , and anxiety-disorders . many of the screening-tests were developed outside the ed . fortunately , many have been applied to ed populations . hence , their performance has been demonstrated in the presence of some of these distracting factors . an ideal-test should also remain accurate with differences in gender , age , race , ethnicity , or language . some variation in test-performance among demographic-groups has been demonstrated in studies of screening-tests in the ed.7,8 an ideal-test in the ed would address both current and lifetime-alcohol-problems . current use would more likely prompt referral or counseling , but past-use predicts poor-outcome from medical-problems such as injury.9 in research-trials , the impracticality of a screening-test may not be evident . research-staff do not have to contend with adding a screening-test to an already lengthy-list of clinical-care-duties . in clinical-practice , several practical-issues will make all the difference to successful-implementation . the ease of use of a screening-test will determine its success . staff with any level of prior-health-training and little additional-training should be able to administer an ideal-test . results should be immediately-available and easy to interpret . the test should be acceptable to regulators , payers , ed staff , and ed patients . several-factors may interfere with implementation . for example , patients may find certain-questions offensive , or they may not be willing to have blood drawn or submit to breathalyzers . clinical-staff may be uncomfortable asking some types of questions . regulators may restrict access to records based on answers to certain-questions and add burdens to hospital-record-keepers . payers may pay for some tests and not others . these and other factors may reduce the effectiveness of a screening-procedure that has been proven effective in research-trials . most experts agree that an ideal ed test is brief ( 1 to 2 minutes ) . most of the quest to develop efficient ed screening has emphasized-brevity . however , a longer test could be self-administered . an ideal-screening-test should not interfere with the routine-sequence of medical-history , physical-examination , and laboratory-testing . the test should be confidential since there may be legal , financial , or social consequences to screening positive . finally , the ideal-test should actually motivate the patient to further assessment , counseling , or referral as needed . currently-available screening-tests based on current-evidence , screening should be undertaken using one or a combination of structured questionnaires.10 screening undertaken using clinical-impression or biochemical-tests is not as accurate or as sensitive as structured-questionnaires for identifying alcohol-use-disorders or problematic consumption.7 of course , bac can help identify acute-intoxication . the alcohol-concentration can be determined by saliva-testing , breath-analysis , or blood test.11,12 clinical-impression clinicians often use their general-impression to help with diagnosis , but clinical-impressions concerning-alcohol-problems can be inaccurate . trained-practitioners counseling-alcoholics could identify only 50 % of acutely intoxicated patients.13 primary-care-physicians and emergency-physicians identified fewer than 50 % of patients with alcohol-problems . unfortunately , the majority of physicians ( 54 % ) screen only those patients they suspect based on their clinical impressions.14-16 stereotypic profiling may be the consequence of screening only suspected patients . gentilello reported that in a trauma-center ed , staff suspected alcohol-ism in 26 % of patients who screened negative on structured-questionnaires . these patients were more likely to be young , male , disheveled , uninsured , and low income.17 of course , some ed patients may spontaneously volunteer information about drinking . cherpitel reported that patient-self-report of drinking prior to arrival had a sensitivity of 29 % for alcohol-problems in the ed.7 structured-questionnaires self-report may be enhanced when specific-alcohol-questions are asked . cyr reported that a single-question in a primary-care setting- '' have you ever had a drinking-problem ? `` -had a high sensitivity ( 40 % to 70 % ) .18 subsequent-reports from other institutions did not replicate the high sensitivity of this single question.19-23 cherpitel evaluated single-question-screens in the ed and found them to be less sensitive than structured questionnaires.7 most existing-screens were developed for primary-care-settings to detect alcohol-use-disorders . the cage was developed in 1968 as a brief-screening-tool for primary-care-providers to detect alcohol-abuse and dependence . cage is a mnemonic from four questions , cut down , annoyed , guilty , and eye opener . the questions address-problems over the patient 's lifetime . cage takes 1 to 2 minutes to administer.24,25 the mast ( michigan alcohol-screening test ) , developed in 1971 as a screen for alcohol-abuse and dependence , has 24 yes/no questions . mast has been self-administered and used in a computer-format . it addresses-problems over the patient 's lifetime . mast requires 20 minutes to administer . a shortened version of the mast exists , a 10-question brief ( b ) mast . bmast takes 5 to 12 minutes to administer and performs nearly as well as the longer version.26-28 saast ( self-administered alcoholism screening-test ) was developed in 1972 to screen for alcohol-abuse and dependence . it has 35 yes/no questions . while lengthy , the saast has the advantage of being self-administered , and it has also been administered in a computerized-format . it addresses-problems over the patient's lifetime . a shortened , 9-item version , the brief saast , takes the patient 5 to 10 minutes to complete.29,30 more recently , screens have been developed to detect at-risk-drinkers . who developed the audit ( alcohol-use-disorder identification test ) in 1992 as a brief-screening-tool to detect at-risk-drinking in addition to alcohol-abuse and dependence . audit has 10 questions . it assesses problems experienced within the last three months and over the patient 's lifetime . audit takes 4 to 8 minutes to administer.31,32 several-screens have been developed for pregnant-women . concern about even lower levels of alcohol-consumption in this group has prompted development of the screens tweak , t-ace , and net . tweak screens for alcohol-abuse and dependence . it has five questions , addresses-problems over the patient 's lifetime , and takes 3 to 5 minutes to administer.33 t-ace also screens for alcohol-abuse and dependence . t-ace has three of the four cage questions and replaces the guilt-question with tolerance-question . t-ace addresses-problems over the patient 's lifetime and takes 1 to 2 minutes to administer.34 net was developed to screen pregnant-patients for at-risk-drinking , alcohol-abuse , and dependence . it is a three-question-screen that takes about 1 minute.33 one screen has been developed for emergency-department-use , the rapid alcohol assessment screen ( raps4 ) . cherpitel screened an ed population with questions from cage , bmast , audit , and tweak . she created raps4 by combining the four highest-yield-questions from those screens , which covered feeling guilty after drinking , blackouts , failing to do what is normally expected after drinking , and morning-drinking . however , this new instrument has not been studied when administered as a stand-alone test.35 in addition to these questionnaires , niaaa suggests that all primary-care-physicians ask an opening question- '' do you drink alcohol ? `` - followed by three questions about alcohol-consumption and then the cage . this sequence was not explicitly designed or studied as a `` screening-test . '' d'onofrio and others have recommended using the niaaa approach in the ed.10 studies of screening-tests cherpitel conducted two studies comparing multiple-screening-tests in the ed . in the first study , tweak and audit were most sensitive , identifying 84 % and 81 % of patients , respectively , with an icd-10 diagnosis of alcohol dependence.7 in the second study , raps and audit were more sensitive than tweak and cage , identifying 79 % and 78 % compared with 72 % and 71 % , respectively , of patients with an icd-10 or dsm-iv diagnosis of alcohol-dependence , harmful-drinking , or abuse.5,36 soderstrom has compared multiple-screening-tests in a trauma-center . he reported that cage performed best , with a sensitivity of 84 % , for a dsm-iv diagnosis of alcohol dependence.37 fiellin reviewed 38 studies of screening for alcohol-use-disorder in the primary-care-setting . for at-risk , hazardous , or harmful-drinking , audit was found most effective with sensitivities of 51 % to 97 % . for alcohol-abuse or dependence , cage was found most effective with sensitivities of 43 % to 94 % . as expected , cage and audit performed best within the spectrum of alcohol-use they were developed to explore.38 screening-biases cherpitel analyzed-variability of test-performance in subgroups of ed patients.39 in her first ed study , cage , bmast , audit , and tweak were less sensitive among females , whites , and non-injured-patients . in her second ed study with hispanic-patients , cage , bmast , audit , tweak , and raps were less sensitive in females , patients with less acculturation , and non-dependent drinkers.36 lowering the cut-point on these screening-instruments improved sensitivity without loss of specificity among females . using lower cut-points for females may maximize screening-test performance.40 bradley reviewed nine studies with data on women 's responses to screening mainly in primary-care-settings . cage , audit , and tweak were the best tests for alcohol-dependence among women . their reported sensitivities were 66 % to 92 % . all three screens performed better among black-women than among white-women . tweak per-formed better than cage or audit among white-women . cage and audit had low sensitivities ( 59 % and 48 % respectively ) for alcohol-dependence among white-women . we must be careful not to employ screening techniques that do not address important subgroups.41 evidence of such low-sensitivity in an important-subgroup may necessitate-use of multiple-screens tailored to subgroups . in addition to women , other subgroups such as adolescents , older adults , pregnant-women , psychiatric-patients , and spanish-speakers may need screening with modified or unique-tests . standard-screens may not perform as well in these patient-subgroups that may represent a considerable-part of the ed population . adjustment of cut-points or use of alternative-screening-tests may be necessary for these subgroups . alcohol-concentration many injured ed patients are screened with a bac , which can help identify intoxication . the presence of alcohol may not always indicate an alcohol-problem . while a very high bac in an unimpaired patient can be a specific-screen for dependence,42 bac is an insensitive-screen for an alcohol-use-disorder . one study found that only one-third of intoxicated-drivers had an alcohol-use disorder.43 in an ed study , bac was a poor-screen for alcohol-abuse or dependence with a sensitivity of 20 % , less sensitive than self-reported drinking.7 in another ed study , a saliva-alcohol level-equivalent to a bac greater than 0.10 g/dl in an injured-patient identified harmful-drinkers ( audit > 8 ) with a sensitivity of 65 % .44 in one trauma-center , bac had a sensitivity of 63 % for an alcohol disorder.5 other biochemical-markers such as mean corpuscular-volume , platelet count , liver-enzymes , gamma-glutamyltransferase ( ggt ) , aspartate-aminotransferase ( ast ) , alanine-aminotransferase ( alt ) , and carbohydrate-deficient-transferrin ( cdt ) perform poorly with sensitivities of 13 % to 67 % for alcohol-use-disorders or problematic con-sumption.45-50 biochemical-tests other than bac may have use in settings other than an ed , but they offer little as screening-tests for ed patients . research-questions : improving existing-screening questionnaires we still need to find the most accurate-test for ed use . this may be raps4 , which is designed for the ed , but it needs further direct-testing . many tests would be improved by wording-questions to address current-problems ( the past year or three months ) rather than lifetime-problems . screening with embedded-questions and indirect-questions may also improve self-report among adolescents and other groups.20,51-53 these approaches need further testing in the ed . the most practical-test may be the shortest , the three-question net . further sequencing of questions within questionnaires may also improve efficiency.35 if one question answered `` yes '' yields a positive-test-score , asking that one first and stopping as soon as the score is positive would be the most efficient-approach . cherpitel has analyzed the sensitivity of each of the raps4 questions and sequenced them from most to least sensitive for most efficient use.35 minimizing-question-sets for interviews will result in obtaining less information . computer-administered or self-administered screens may address this issue by allowing-patients to spend more time completing in-depth questioning with no additional-staff time.54,55 this approach promises practical-avenues for obtaining more information . a trial of screening-tests in various-formats ( e.g. , interview , self-administered-forms , and computer interaction ) should be undertaken to compare their cost and value in the ed . the most motivational-screening-test is unknown . drawing-blood and confronting-patients with their blood-alcohol-levels may actually push them away from counseling . screening-questions that reveal the negative-consequences or link-alcohol to current-problems may motivate patients to seek counseling . providing immediate-feedback may help make the transition from screening to counseling with little additional-intervention . the motivational aspects of a variety of screens , with and without verbal or computer-feedback , need to be explored . research-questions : finding the best approach to screening to determine the best of the available-screens , a multi-center-trial with a broad demographic-mix and a large number of patients subjected to different-screens is needed . further evaluation should be performed of lower cut-points for tweak , cage , and audit . the advantage of tailored-screens or specific-questions for subgroups such as women,41 adolescents,54-59 and elders,60-64 needs to be determined . raps4 must be further tested as a stand-alone-screen in isolation and against other tests . a longer , self-administered screen-including one administered by computer-should also be tested in the ed . to determine the best sequence for screening , the approach recommended by niaaa for primary-care should be compared with other sequences . several-trials of variations of the niaaa approach are warranted . trials should be conducted starting with other or no opening-questions , using other consumption-questions such as those in audit , using other screens such as tweak rather than cage , changing the sequence to cage or tweak followed by consumption-questions , and checking bac at the beginning or end of the protocol . the best screen should be determined in the context of a screening and intervention-program . some questions or screens may lead naturally to referral and treatment . others may not promote referral and treatment . much of the screening-literature is isolated from intervention . future-studies need to incorporate evaluation of screening linked to intervention-protocols . barriers to implementing-screening in a research-protocol in england , nurses were trained to screen all emergency-patients with cage and then provide feedback . only 20 % of patients were screened . of them , 19 % had positive cage scores ; of those , only 41 % were provided feedback . even with feedback , only 12 % accepted-follow-up . of 4,663 patients , only 13 were entered into the trial and the trial was abandoned.65,66 there are multiple-barriers to screening . nurses identified-lack of resources , inadequate-training , stress , poor-morale , and no perceived value to the intervention . in a survey sponsored by the west virginia chapter of the american college of emergency-physicians , a minority of emergency-physicians reported routine-screening and counseling of ed patients.67 the authors reported provider-attitudes of disinterest , avoidance , disdain , and pessimism as well as inadequate-time , insufficient-education , and lack of resources as barriers . surveys and interventions should be undertaken to define and reduce barriers to implementing-screening in clinical-practice . currently , screening is a research-tool , not a clinical-tool . ed staff does not use structured-questionnaires for alcohol-screening . ed staff has no systematic-approach to alcohol-screening . staff chooses to screen some individuals and not others based on clinical suspicions or partially implemented protocols . in general , ed staff screens less often than addiction-experts recommend . universal-screening is appropriate in populations with high case-rates . eds have reported high case-rates of alcohol-problems , especially acute-intoxication , from 9 % to 31 % .17,28,46,68-71 within the ed , there are even higher case-rates in subgroups . major trauma , injuries , assaults,72 depression , and alcohol-related medical-problems like gastrointestinal-bleeding or seizures define even higher risk-subgroups . many experts advocate focusing screening on some of the highest-risk-groups or screening with greater intensity and different-tools in these groups . implementing-screening in clinical-practice any ed staff-member could be assigned the screening-task . physician , nurse , clerical , social-work , or volunteer-staff can conduct-screening . we do not know which staff-group will be most effective . self-administered-questionnaires , computer-screen interactions , or interview-techniques may be easier to implement . screening-questions can be stand-alone or embedded into general health-questionnaires or existing-registration , physician , and nurse-documentation . screening-protocols can be mandatory or voluntary . the approaches that will be most effective in ed practice should be determined by studying the implementation of these strategies in actual ed clinical-practices . studies of the translation of efficacious-research-practice into clinical-practice is needed most since screening-instruments have been used by research-staff and not clinical-staff . impact of screening ed patient-care should be improved by implementing-alcohol screening-programs . a major-limit to realizing this improvement is the lack of counseling available to address patients ' alcohol-problems in most eds . most eds provide very limited-alcohol-services . when care is unavailable , screening makes little-sense to clinicians . realizing a gain from screening in an ed is entirely-dependent upon linking the screening-program to some form of counseling , onsite or through referral-services . the impact of screening should be demonstrated in ed environments that have treatment available , an adequate volume of alcohol-involved-patients , and the capacity to undertake clinical trials . studies in these centers should demonstrate the benefits of screening : increased-referrals , more patients receiving counseling , and better outcomes such as reduction of risk-behaviors . summary : research areas of interest concerning-screening the ideal-screen that is accurate , practical , and motivational has not been developed . researchers must continue to analyze the performance of structured-questionnaires and try computer-based-screening tools in the ed . the sequence of screening-tests needs to be evaluated by studying the niaaa approach and several-alternatives . screening must move from research to clinical-practice . barriers to screening in clinical-practice must be identified and removed . studies of implementation of screening-programs in ed clinical-practice should be undertaken . the impact of screening on referral and intervention , as well as outcomes such as reduced risk-behaviors , must be demonstrated . references 1 . lowenstein s , koziol-mclain j , thompson m , et al . behavioral-risk-factors in emergency-department-patients : a
