p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : mr. andrew s. fishel managing director federal communications commission enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . §§ 801 ( a ) ( i ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the federal communications commission entitled `` flexible-service-offerings in the commercial mobile-radio-services '' ( wt docket no . 96-6 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the commission indicated in its submission that it was not required to prepare a cost-benefit-analysis of the rule ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 section 603 initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis pursuant to section 603 of the act , the commission incorporated an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis ( irfa ) in its notice of proposed-rulemaking , and written comments were requested . the preamble to the rule-states that no comments were received specifically in response to the irfa , but that issues were raised that might affect small-business-entities . in particular , a small business-commenter argued that the proposed flexibility in the use of the cmrs bands not be extended to cellular-providers initially in order to give personal-communications service ( pcs ) licensees an opportunity to establish themselves . the commission also reports that it forwarded a copy of its initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis to the chief-counsel for advocacy of the small business-administration ( sba ) as required by the act . section 604 final regulatory-flexibility-analysis the commission prepared a final regulatory-flexibility-analysis pursuant to section 604 . that analysis notes that the rule will carry out the congress ' intent to establish a consistent regulatory-framework for all commercial mobile-radio-services and that the rule will assist in the development of competition between wireless and wireline-services for the benefit of consumers . the analysis notes that the rulemaking applies to providers of cellular , narrowband and broadband-pcs , cmrs , specialized mobile-radio-services , cmrs paging commercial 220 mhz services , and for-profit-interconnected business radio-services . each category of services was analyzed separately . gao/ogc-96-40 cellular . in absence of its own standards , the commission defined small business with respect to cellular-services by utilizing the sba definition for radiotelephone-companies , e.g. , an entity employing less than 1,500 persons . because of the absence of meaningful-data concerning the number of entities which are small , the commission used the 1992 census of transportation , communications and utilities conducted by the bureau of the census as the most recent-information available . that census indicated that only 12 of the 1,178 radiotelephone-firms had 1,000 or more employees . that data does not , however , indicate the number of cellular-providers among the 1,178 firms . based on the above , the fcc concluded that for the purpose of the final regulatory-flexibility-analysis , all cellular-licensees are small businesses as defined by the sba . pcs . the fcc ( with the approval of the sba ) has defined small business in this category to mean businesses who have gross-revenues not to exceed $ 40 million per year for the prior 3 calendar-years . broadband-pcs licenses were auctioned for blocks a , b , and c. no auction has been held for blocks d , e and f. the fcc asserts that it has insufficient-information upon which to determine whether any small businesses within the sba-approved definition were successful-bidders for blocks a and b . for block c , the fcc estimates that 89 of the 90 nondefaulting-bidders are small businesses . for blocks d , e. and f , the fcc has switched from the $ 40 million criteria to the under 1,500 employee category . given that nearly all radiotelephone-companies have less than 1,500 employees , the fcc concludes that all of the 1,479 licenses for these blocks will be awarded to small businesses . because of a similar-lack of meaningful-data , the commission has concluded that all of the 30 regional-licenses for narrowband-pcs and all of the 11 licenses for narrowband nationwide-pcs-licenses have been awarded to small business . smr . the fcc has created two tiers of small business for this service with the approval of the sba . firms with not more than $ 3 million gross-revenue for each of the three preceding-calendar years are categorized as very small ; with not more than $ 15 million for the same period are small . according to the analysis , 60 winning-bidders for the 900 mhz licenses qualify as small-entities ( no breakdown of small vs. very small ) . there has been no auction for the 800 mhz licenses . interconnected-business-services . according to the fcc , there is no meaningful-data as to the number of for-profit-interconnected business-service ( ibs ) licensees that are small business , although the commission concludes that all of the current-license-holders are small based on the 1,500 employee sba criteria . the fcc notes that while there are in excess of 13,000 for-profit ibs licenses , a single-licensee may hold multiple-licenses so that it is not possible to determine the actual-number of individual-licensees for the service . the analysis concludes that the rules do not impose additional-reporting , record keeping , or other compliance-requirements . section 605 : avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis the commission did not invoke any of the exemptions or special procedures authorized by section 605 in preparing its regulatory-flexibility-analysis . section 607 : preparation of analysis under section 607 , the commission 's submission does not specifically indicate the potential economic-impact on the small-entities affected . however , the regulatory-flexibility-analysis indicates that the rule will benefit all cmrs small business licensees by providing them greater flexibility to determine which service they will provide to the public . section 609 : participation by small-entities based on the information before us , it appears that there were no special-efforts made by the commission to involve small-entities in the rulemaking-process , other than the actions required by 5 u.s.c . § 553 . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 as an independent regulatory-agency , the commission is not subject to title ii of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule was promulgated through the general-notice of proposed-rulemaking procedures of the act , 5 u.s.c . § 553 . the commission afforded interested-persons the opportunity to comment on the proposed-rule , and the commission 's report and order addresses these comments . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule does not contain either a proposed or modified information-collection . statutory-authorization for the rule the rules are promulgated with the authority provided in the communications act of 1934 , as amended , 47 u.s.c . §§ 154 ( i ) , 154 ( j ) , 157 ( a ) , 303 ( b ) , 303 ( f ) , 303 ( g ) , 303 ( r ) , 332 ( a ) , and ( c ) . executive-order no . 12866 as an independent regulatory-agency as defined in 44 u.s.c . § 3502 ( 10 ) , the fcc is not subject to executive-order no . 12866 . the commission did not identify any other statutes or executive-orders imposing-requirements relevant to the rule .
