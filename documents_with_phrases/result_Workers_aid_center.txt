workers ' aid-center open today by holly edwards staff writer july 13 , 2002 thousands of low-income-residents throughout the san fernando valley face-exploitation in the workplace -- overtime without pay , long hours without breaks , earnings below the minimum-wage . now , those workers may be able to recover what they are owed through the workers ' rights self-help-center , which opens at 9 a.m. today at mission college in sylmar . housed in the college 's campus-center , the workers ' rights-center will be staffed by volunteers -- college-students and attorneys from neighborhood legal-services , a nonprofit-organization that provides legal-help to the poor . it will be open every saturday morning . those involved with the effort say the center will help-workers to learn how to stand up for their rights and students to learn skills they can use in the workplace . `` a lot of times-education is done in a vacuum , but this will help-students learn to deal with people who are upset , spot legal-issues and learn to be empathetic and still do their job , '' said david jordan , a law-professor at mission college . `` for the workers , the goal is self-empowerment through education , and they might also decide to sign up for a night-course while they 're here . '' the workers ' rights-center is the second created by neighborhood legal-services . the other center has operated at monroe high school in north hills for two years and serves about 100 people each month , said nancy cervantes , an attorney for neighborhood legal-services . the center is funded by a grant from the state-bar of california . it will provide brochures , form-letters seeking back pay and other benefits , and help clients understand the law , but it will not provide legal-representation , cervantes said . it will also help all low-income-workers , regardless of their residency-status . `` immigration-status is irrelevant , '' cervantes said . `` this a place where anyone can get legal-information . it 's open to all workers who have employment-problems . '' cervantes said workplace-abuses are widespread and occur primarily in the garment , construction , restaurant and domestic services-businesses . in one case she is now reviewing , she said two men who were cousins worked for the same construction-business and put in thousands of hours of unpaid-labor . one man is owed $ 70,000 , while the other is owed $ 20,000 , she said . `` the most important thing is to keep track of all the hours you work , especially if the employer does n't provide that information , '' she said . `` you do n't have to have a lawyer , but you have to know your rights . '' many of those exploited in the workplace are undocumented residents who believe they have no rights , while others are threatened with termination if they complain , she said . cervantes added that undocumented-laborers have the same rights as anyone else in the workplace , except they ca n't file for unemployment-benefits if fired . `` if undocumented-workers did n't have rights , it would amount to slavery , '' cervantes said . `` most employers do n't exploit their workers , but there are some employers who really do take advantage of their workers , and immigrants are more vulnerable to this abuse . '' edgar villatoro , a 30-year-old father of two from van nuys , said he worked 100-hour weeks for a party-supply-business but was paid for only 40 hours . with cervantes ' help , he said he wrote his employer a letter demanding the money , provided an account of the hours he worked , and just received two checks totaling more than $ 3,000 . `` a lot of times i worked sunday to sunday , '' villatoro said . `` but when i asked my boss about the overtime , he told me i could walk out the door anytime . '' cervantes said this is exactly the type of exploitation that can be prevented through education . `` we 're helping them to help themselves by knowing their rights , '' she said .
