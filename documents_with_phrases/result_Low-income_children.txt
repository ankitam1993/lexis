foster 's online tuesday , february 19 , 2002 study : low-income-children lack advocates in court portland , maine ( ap ) - low-income-children in maine involved in divorce or parental-rights-cases are often denied the benefits of court-advocates because their families can not afford to pay the fees , according to a new report . the report by the muskie school of public-service at the university of southern maine completes a three-year-evaluation of guardian ad litem - or gals - in divorce and parental-rights and responsibilities-cases in the state . gals are lawyers or licensed mental-health-counselors appointed by a court to represent a child 's best interests in family proceedings . their fees , which can range between $ 75 and $ 150 per hour under a private-system , are paid for by the family , said muskie fellowship recipient alison beyea . `` overall , we found that gals are very beneficial , '' said beyea , who co-wrote the report with frank d'alessandro . `` however , we also discovered that in hundreds of cases each year , the court recommends that a gal be appointed but can not do so because the families ca n't afford the fee . '' beyea said the study was conducted because of growing-concern that low-income-children were subject to intense , emotional arguments that more affluent-children would be sheltered from . `` the children are living in fairly intolerable-situations while the parents are battling it out , '' she said . `` there may not be anyone else involved to insulate them . '' often , gals end up doing more social-work than legal-counseling , such as improving-communication between family members , beyea said . `` collaboration with mental-health-groups is critical , '' she said . beyea , a lawyer at pine tree legal-services , conducted the study and said she surveyed district-court judges , case-management officers , family-law-attorneys and people registered to be gals . there were 170 gals in maine at the time of her study , she said . beyea said the report 's findings are timely , given that chief-justice leigh saufley has said that one of her priorities is to provide gals to all children , regardless of economic background . unlike child protective-cases , children in divorce-proceedings are not guaranteed the right to a court-appointed-guardian by the state . low-income-children who have been victims of abuse or neglect are not charged for guardians ; rather , the state pays the gal $ 50 per hour under the state-courts-budget . beyea said she would like to see the state implement a similar-program that offers resources to lower-income-families involved in divorce and parental-rights and responsibilities-cases . `` we do think , given the report , that there might be some legislative-appropriation , '' she said .
