providing legal-aid to the poor terry russell , president of the florida bar , has spent months pushing-legislation that would provide state-funding for legal-assistance for the poor . he makes a compelling-case . legal-assistance means providing-advice and other help in civil-matters to low-income-floridians with generally-uncomplicated legal-problems . for many , it is the key to stabilizing their lives . the bar says roughly 30 percent of indigent-households have some legal-needs in a given year , yet florida makes no annual legislative-appropriation to serve these residents . instead , the state depends on 41 local-not-for-profit-organizations , funded at $ 54 million a year , and the $ 172 million in time donated by members of the bar to serve these needy-families . these legal-aid-groups and the individuals providing pro-bono-services do a commendable-job , but they can not meet the demand . as russell points out , some 400,000 legal-aid-cases go unassisted each year . he hopes a streamlined and more efficient-network can be put in place to ensure that floridians who need help have access to it . that network is provided for in the florida access to civil legal-assistance act , which has passed out of committees in both the state house and senate and is headed to appropriations review . the act proposes to create an administrative-framework under the department of community affairs to contract with a statewide not-for- profit-group to allocate funds to nonprofit legal-organizations . the cost is estimated at $ 10 million to be obtained from unused federal-welfare-funds from the temporary-assistance for needy-families-program . but the funding is uncertain , and congress failed to reauthorize $ 65 million in supplemental tanf moneys . nevertheless , russell is determined . significantly , the bill places limits on how funds can be used . funds may not be used to lobby for passage or defeat of legislation , nor to provide legal-advice in criminal or post conviction-proceedings . they can not be used to sue the state or any agencies or subdivisions of the state , nor any colleges or universities . nor can the moneys be spent to initiate or participate in a class-action-lawsuit . some question the constitutionality of the act in light of a u.s. supreme court decision last year that struck down on first amendment grounds a law that limited what lawyers could argue when representing-clients in welfare-cases . this bill , however , is distinguishable because it limits specific-representation and does not restrict lawyers in the manner of that representation . for every poor-family that receives legal-assistance , russell says , four families will go without any aid . the legislature should help-fund-organizations that offer such assistance to those in need .
