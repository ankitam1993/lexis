new york times study finds bias on the job is still common by reed abelson july 24 , 2002 women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment-opportunities in the united states , but discrimination remains a significant-problem , according to a study to be released today by two professors at the rutgers school of law in newark . the study , which extrapolated from federal-data on about 200,000 large and midsize-employers , concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional-discrimination in 1999 . roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job-category , the authors said the study was based on information collected from employers by the equal-employment-opportunity commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called eeo-1 forms . the husband-and-wife-team of alfred w. and ruth g. blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different-job-categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic-area . they described a company as an intentional-discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard-deviations from the average . legally , companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment-numbers are far below the norm . about 22,000 employers were identified as `` hard-core '' discriminators . these companies employed below-average-numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly . the study also found rising-employment for women and minorities , suggesting significant progress in the workplace . the names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers . the professors expect to make their study available through a web site , www.eeo1.com . the blumrosens , who were instrumental in setting up the e.e.o.c . in 1965 , also say the government should make more active-use of their data . the commission said it did not comment on draft-reports .
