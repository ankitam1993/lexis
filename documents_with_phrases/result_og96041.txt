( ii ) actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 initial-analysis hcfa included the full-text of its combined initial regulatory impact/regulatory flexibility-analysis ( analysis ) as an appendix to the may 31 , 1996 proposed-rule . see 61 fed . reg . 27566-27584 . in response to our inquiry , hcfa staff explained that it did not submit a copy of the analysis to sba . however , in hcfa 's view , its publication of the full-text of the analysis with the proposed-rule satisfied the 1hcfa considers all hospitals to be small-entities for purposes of the regulatory-flexibility-act . gao/ogc-96-41 submission-requirement . we have learned that some agencies follow this practice without objection from sba . as required by 5 u.s.c . §§ 603 ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the analysis , coupled with the summary in the preamble , explains the reasons and objectives , as well as legal-bases , for the proposed-rule . section 1886 ( d ) of the social-security act , 42 u.s.c . § 1395ww ( d ) , generally provides for a system of payment for the operating costs of hospital inpatient-services under medicare part a based on prospectively set-rates . in addition , under section 1886 ( g ) of the social-security act , 42 u.s.c . § 1395ww ( g ) , capital-related-costs for those hospitals whose operating costs are paid under a prospective-payment-system are also to be paid based on prospectively set-rates . in response to directives contained in these sections and hcfa 's experience , the rule adjusts various-elements associated with hospital-costs . 61 fed . reg . at 27444-27445 . according to the analysis , the changes are designed to further the objectives of the prospective-payment system,2 while maintaining the financial-viability of the hospital-industry and ensuring-access to high quality-health-care for medicare beneficiaries . 61 fed . reg . at 27566 . consistent with section 603 ( b ) ( 3 ) , the analysis describes , and estimates the number of , small-entities to which the rule will apply . the rule will apply to 82 percent of the general , short-term , acute-care-hospitals that participate in the medicare program , or 5,130 hospitals , all of which are considered small-entities by hcfa . of the 5,130 hospitals , 2,252 are rural . the analysis describes and illustrates the impact of the rule on various-types of rural and urban-hospitals . as discussed below , the proposed-rule would modify an existing-reporting requirement applicable to all hospitals serving medicare beneficiaries . hcfa did not discuss the proposed change in its analysis , but in the preamble to the proposed rule.3 thus , hcfa also satisfied its responsibility under 5 u.s.c . § 603 ( b ) ( 4 ) . finally , with respect to sections 603 ( b ) ( 5 ) and ( c ) , the analysis does not identify any federal-rules that duplicate , overlap , or conflict with the proposed-rule or any significant regulatory-alternatives . since , according to hcfa , all hospitals subject to the rule are small-entities , it would be difficult to minimize the impact of the rule on such entities within the constraints of the medicare program . as discussed 2the objectives of the prospective-payment-system are to encourage hospitals to operate efficiently , while ensuring that they are compensated for legitimate-costs . 61 fed . reg . at 27566 . 3under 5 u.s.c . § 605 ( a ) , agencies may perform the analyses required by sections 603 and 604 in conjunction with or as part of any other agenda or analysis required by other law if such other analysis satisfies the provisions of these sections . page 2 gao/ogc-96-41 below , hcfa addressed-comments on various-elements of the proposed-rule throughout the preamble to the final-rule . final-analysis consistent with 5 u.s.c . § 604 , hcfa included the full-text of its final-analysis as an appendix to the final-rule . 61 fed . reg . 46166 , 46303-46320 . as in the case of the initial-analysis , hcfa summarized the need for the rule in the preamble . 61 fed . reg . at 46166-46167 . in the final-analysis , hcfa replaced the `` objectives '' section with a discussion of changes to the initial-analysis . see 61 fed . reg . at 46303-46304 . with respect to section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) , the analysis issued with the final-rule-states that hcfa received no comments on the methodology used in its initial-analysis . 61 fed . reg . at 46304 . it also states that any differences between the two analyses resulted from hcfa's use of `` more recent or more complete-hospital-data . '' 61 fed . reg . at 46303 . the analysis describes , and estimates the number of , small-entities to which the rule will apply as required by section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) . see 61 fed . reg . at 46304 . the analysis indicates that the rule will apply to 5,129 , rather than 5,130 , general , short-term , acute-care-hospitals . id . the analysis indicates a decrease of four rural-hospitals and an increase of three urban-hospitals , for a net-decrease of one . 61 fed . reg . at 46306 . the final-analysis also describes the rule 's impact on covered entities and , like the earlier analysis , specifically distinguishes between urban and rural-hospitals . hcfa did not discuss its proposed modification of an existing-reporting requirement in the analysis , as described in section 604 ( a ) ( 4 ) , but in the preamble . also , like the earlier analysis , the final-analysis does not discuss steps taken to minimize the economic-impact of the rule on hospitals under section 604 ( a ) ( 5 ) . since hcfa did not discuss regulatory-alternatives in the earlier analysis , it did not describe the reasons for its approach in the final-analysis . sections 607 and 609 section 607-permits-agencies , in complying with sections 603 and 604 , to provide either a quantifiable or numerical-description of the effects of a rule or more general-descriptive-statements if quantification is not practicable or reliable . the analyses issued with the proposed and final-rules provide quantifiable-descriptions of the rule 's impact on covered entities , including rural-hospitals . see , e.g. , 61 fed . reg . at 46306 ( describing-percent changes in payments per case due to changes in the prospective-payment-system for operating costs ) . page 3 gao/ogc-96-41 finally , section 609 ( a ) requires that agencies ensure that small-entities are given an opportunity to participate in a rulemaking through the reasonable-use of techniques such as those enumerated . as discussed , hcfa published the full-text of its initial-analysis as an appendix to the proposed-rule and invited-comments from small-entities . hcfa staff has advised that it did not take any other actions specifically designed to ensure participation by small-entities , including rural-hospitals , in this rulemaking . however , hcfa staff also pointed out that , in carrying out its responsibilities under the medicare program , hcfa maintains an appropriate ongoing working-relationship with industry officials . ( iii ) actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995,2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 since the rule does not impose a federal intergovernmental or private-sector-mandate , as defined in the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , sections 202 , 204 and 205 of the act are inapplicable . similarly , section 203 of the act is inapplicable because the rule will not significantly affect small-governments . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . § 551 et seq . with the exception of the matter discussed below , hcfa promulgated the changes to the medicare prospective-payment-systems under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 and section 1871 ( b ) of the social-security act , 42 u.s.c . § 1395hh ( b ) .4 the proposed-rule was published in the federal register on may 31 , 1996 ; hcfa stated that it would consider comments received by july 31 , 1996 . the final-rule was published on august 30 , 1996 . hcfa received 511 timely-pieces of correspondence containing-comments on the proposed-rule . see 61 fed . reg . at 46167 . those comments are discussed throughout the preamble to the final-rule . in the final-rule , hcfa revised certain-regulations pertaining to the costs of graduate medical-education-programs to conform to a recently enacted statute . the agency 's 1996 appropriation requires that , for certain-purposes , the federal government `` deem accredited any postgraduate physician training-program that would be accredited but for the accrediting-agency 's reliance upon an accreditation-standard that requires an entity to perform an induced abortion or require , provide , or refer for training in the performance of induced abortions , or make arrangements for such training . . ..
