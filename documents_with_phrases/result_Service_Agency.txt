service agency tries to simplify legal-problems of maine's needy by betty adams tuesday , december 17 , 2002 augusta - ninety percent of the cases handled by attorney jack comart are settled before they turn into lawsuits . that 's best for his clients , he says , because most are people with low-incomes and a history of legal-problems that could prove detrimental if aired in court . comart is a lawyer with pine tree legal-assistance inc. , a statewide-group that provides free legal-aid to those who qualify . the agency is 35 years old , and administrators estimate it has helped about 250,000 people over those years with urgent legal-problems . last year alone , the agency aided more than 14,000 people , according to nan heald , who has been with pine tree legal since 1985 and directed it since 1990 . comart , who lives in readfield , is based in the agency 's augusta office , a short-walk from augusta district-court and kennebec county superior court . but most of his work is done outside the courtroom and over the telephone with administrators of state-programs , including medicaid , and with landlords . another attorney in the office handles domestic-violence-cases , and still another is on-site at lewiston district-court every wednesday to assist an average of 20 people facing-eviction who want to speak to a lawyer . `` we deal with a lot of emergencies , '' comart said . `` it 's still amazing how many people call us up the day before or after their hearing . they either did n't go to court or they lost at court . '' pine tree is dealing with fewer evictions pending in augusta district-court . `` in this area , i have n't seen too many bad landlords , '' comart said . part of the problem , he said , is that rents are rising but wages and public-benefits are not . the agency takes credit for `` abolition of debtors ' prison , the right to due-process and a fair-hearing , the first successful employment-discrimination-lawsuits , improved-housing-codes and accessibility for people with disabilities . '' comart said legal-aid works well in maine . he contrasted it to his experience in the 1970s and early-1980s in kentucky . `` legal-services-providers were viewed as complete-outsiders , '' he said . `` the judicial-system and the private-bar had no use for us and no support . maine is much-different . i 'm sort of amazed at the level of support by the private-bar . '' through the volunteer-lawyers project , private-attorneys donate their services to do some cases for pine tree , including-debt collection and contract-disputes . over the past two decades , comart has seen the role of pine tree change in response to federal-funding-cuts and stricter regulations . heald said , `` we used to have almost all of our funding from four sources , general unrestricted-funds . now that is about half . the rest are specific annual-grants that require us to do particular kinds of work . '' some of that work includes access to health-care-benefits and aiding-families that may have a housing-problem but also have other issues , such as a disabled-child . heald said the agency can try to find mental-health-services , school-services and others . `` we're looking at the big-picture , '' she said . `` we specialize in public-benefits , housing-evictions and domestic-violence , '' comart said , but added that because of such a high volume of need and staffing-reductions , `` most cases are advice and brief-services as opposed to extended-representation . '' the agency has shrunk over the past few years because it 's been barred since 1995 from bringing-class-action-lawsuits and welfare-reform challenges and banned from collecting-attorneys-fees from lawsuits and from doing any legislative-lobbying . former-staff-attorneys mary henderson and chris hastedt subsequently began the maine equal-justice project , which concentrates on lobbying and class-actions . the interest on lawyer trust-accounts , administered by the maine bar-foundation , helps to fund pine tree legal , maine equal-justice , cumberland-legal aid and legal-services for the elderly . in addition , the courts have assessed a fee on civil-filings , a funding-source that supports the maine civil legal-services fund . and the coffin fellowship program provides money for attorneys who do domestic-relations-work . while pine tree has income-guidelines for its clients in housing and public-benefits-cases , there are no income-limits for those receiving-services to prevent domestic-violence . comart said a new video-conferencing-feature allows those at domestic-violence-shelters to get legal-help without going to court . the agency offers forms for renters to try to get their security-deposit returned , and forms for people who want to get divorced or modify their divorce-decree . some of those are available on the web at www.ptla.org and can be printed out and taken to court . other information is provided also , and one person at pine tree does client-education exclusively . pine tree offices are located in augusta , bangor , lewiston , machias , portland , presque isle and rockland . the agency has 53 people on staff , including 27 attorneys , some of whom function as administrators and others who are part-time . the annual-operating-budget is about $ 3.4 million , heald said .
