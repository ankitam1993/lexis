november 2000 gao s congressional-protocols united states general-accounting-office washington , d.c. 20548 november 3 , 2000 this document contains the protocols governing the general-accounting-office 's ( gao ) work for the congress . the need for these protocols was consistently voiced to me by members of the congress and their staffs since my nomination as comptroller general . i firmly believe they will enable gao to better serve the congress , improve satisfaction with our work , and ensure equitable-treatment of all requesters . these protocols are intended to provide clearly defined and transparent-policies and practices relating to gao 's work . they also provide a means of holding gao accountable for commitments made to the congress and ensuring that gao is consistent in dealing with all committees and members . they reflect a number of refinements made on the basis of feedback from members and staff during our trial-implementation-phase ( january 2000 to september 2000 ) . along with all members of the gao team , i look forward to using these protocols to continue to serve the congress for the benefit of the american people . we will continue to monitor the application of these protocols and will consider what , if any , changes should be made in the future . any changes will be made in consultation with the congress . i encourage you to contact our office of congressional relations on ( 202 ) 512-4400 if you have any questions or comments on these protocols . david m. walker comptroller general of the united states contents letter gao 's congressional-protocols gao 's congressional-protocols gao 's approach the following-protocols are general-principles governing gao work for the congress involving-audits , program-reviews and evaluations , analyses , and investigations . to effectively-support the congress , gao must be professional , objective , fact-based , nonpartisan , nonideological , fair , and balanced in all its work . all gao products and services should conform to generally accepted and applicable-auditing , accounting , investigative , and evaluation-principles and standards . gao will only undertake work that is within its scope of authority and competency . gao will strive to meet the congress ' needs within available-resources and exercise the independence necessary to guarantee that its products and work conform to professional-standards and the agency 's core-values of accountability , integrity , and reliability . sources of gao gao undertakes work through three primary-means : ( 1 ) congressional-mandates , ( 2 ) congressional-requests , work and ( 3 ) legal-authority allowing gao to undertake work intended to support the congress . setting-priorities gao has a statutory-obligation to fulfill requests from the congress and its committees . to effectively accomplish this obligation , gao senior officials consult regularly with committee-members and their staffs to ensure that gao 's work is prioritized in accordance with the committees ' needs and gao 's resources by subject-matter . to ensure adherence to gao 's core-values , effective-management practices , and efficient-use of available-resources , gao will prioritize its work in the following-order . 1 . congressional-mandates , senior-leader-requests , and committee-leader-requests 2 . committee member requests 3 . individual-member-requests congressional-mandates include requirements specifically directed by statutes , conference-reports , or committee-reports . senior-leader-requests include requests from the president pro tempore , senate majority leader , senate minority leader , speaker of the house , house majority leader , or house minority leader . committee-leader-requests are those from the committee or subcommittee-chair , ranking minority member ( ranking-member ) , or both , on a program or activity within the committee 's jurisdiction . committee member requests are those involving a program or activity within the jurisdiction of the member 's assigned committees . individual-member-requests are those for work where the program or activity is not within the jurisdiction of the member 's assigned committees . with respect to setting-priorities , gao considers the nature of the requested work in light of senate and house rules governing the committees , including their appropriation , authorization , budgetary , and oversight-jurisdiction over a program or activity . when jurisdictional-issues arise , gao will encourage members and staff to consult with each other to resolve any related-disputes . in doing so , they may seek a resolution through the senate or house parliamentarian . gao devotes a limited-portion of its resources for research and development that enables gao to ( 1 ) invest in issues the congress may need to address in the future and ( 2 ) provide products of broad institutional-interest to the congress . this work includes compendiums such as periodic-reports on highrisk-areas and other governmentwide major-management-challenges . congressional-mandates gao treats work that is directed by congressional-mandates differently from congressional-requests . because congressional-mandates are established by either the entire congress or one or more committees , it is gao 's policy that products prepared in response to congressional-mandates are issued without any restrictions ( i.e. , immediately-available to the entire congress and the public ) . when mandates direct gao to report to a specific committee , gao will work with the majority and minority of the designated committee to clarify our reporting-objectives and time-frames . if the mandate does not specify a committee , gao will work with the committees of jurisdiction ( majority and minority ) as set forth in senate and house rules and any other committees and/or members identified by the committees of jurisdiction . gao will meet with designated committees and members regarding the scope and timing of work . while the work is ongoing , gao will provide them ( 1 ) periodic-status-reports on the work , ( 2 ) briefings on the preliminary and final-results of the work , and ( 3 ) notification before the draft-product is sent to the agency for comment and offer a copy of the draft for informational-purposes . congressional-requests congressional-requests for gao work must be made in writing by a member and addressed to the comptroller general . members or their staffs are encouraged to consult informally with gao representatives in developing-requests for gao work . gao will do work without a written-request only if the work involves limited technical-assistance that can be completed within 5-staff-days , such as providing-briefings on prior-work or readily-available information . gao will refer any person who wants a copy of a request-letter to the member who submitted it . for requests that involve work on programs or activities relating to the internal-operations of the congress-the commitment to congressional-requesters senate , house , or both -- gao will work with the requester to seek bipartisan-support for such requests . if the request affects both houses of congress , gao will work with the requester to seek bicameral-support for the request from either ( 1 ) the senior-leaders of the senate and house or ( 2 ) the chairs and ranking members of the senate and house committees of jurisdiction over the congressional-program or activity . if the request affects only one house , gao will work with the requester to seek support for the request from either ( 1 ) the senior-leaders of the affected house or ( 2 ) the chair and ranking-member of the committee ( s ) of jurisdiction over the congressional-program or activity . when it is not possible to obtain bicameral or bipartisan-support , gao will work with the requester to notify the other house or party of the request before gao commits itself to do the work . ( see gao-03-198g . ) gao will provide to all members who request work , within 10-business-days of receipt , a letter acknowledging the receipt of the request and either accepting or declining it . this letter may be augmented by a verbal-communication . when a request is accepted , gao will provide the requester an estimate of when the job is likely to be staffed ( e.g. , immediately , within a few weeks , within several months , or at a future-date to be determined ) . when a request is declined , gao will provide the requester the rationale for declining the work ( e.g. , the requested work is outside gao's scope of authority , gao already has ongoing-work addressing the issue , or resource-constraints limit our ability to respond to a member request ) . gao will , where appropriate , suggest alternatives to meet the requester 's needs . in consideration of its past practice for requests from gao 's oversight-committees-senate governmental affairs and house government reform-gao will send a copy of our letter to either the chair ( if the ranking-member submitted the request ) or the ranking-member ( if the chair submitted the request ) of those committees . congressional-requesters should not expect gao to proceed with the request or provide additional-services until gao has informed each requester that it will accept the request . when members submit independent-requests on the same issue and gao has not formally accepted the requests , gao will consult with the members and their staffs and will merge requests only if the requesters agree . otherwise , gao will issue separate-products . in limited-circumstances , however , gao will work with the requesters to merge multiple-requests it receives relating to a major-event , such as a natural-disaster or accident . after accepting the request , gao will initiate a meeting with the requester 's staff within 20-business-days of receiving the request to gain a better understanding of the requester 's need for information and the nature of the research-questions . during this meeting , gao will also ( 1 ) discuss gao 's ability to respond within the desired time frame , ( 2 ) provide a verbal-estimate of the level of gao resources required , and ( 3 ) advise the requester that , as the original-requester , only he or she can approve co-requesters . if this option is exercised , gao will send a letter to the original-requester and each co-requester documenting this agreement . once the requester and gao have agreed to proceed with the request , gao will provide the following to the requester : • a letter confirming the agreements reached within 10-business-days after gao and the requester agree on the terms , including the need for a job-design-phase and a preliminary expected completion-date . • periodic-status-reports ; notification of any significant changed circumstances affecting the scope of work or related time-frames for completing the work ( e.g. , availability , reliability , or access to agency-records , commitment to co-requesters data or sources of information ) ; and briefing ( s ) on the preliminary and final-results of the work . • the option to withdraw at any time-sponsorship of work that is not intended to result in a written-product ( e.g. , a report ) . if gao has agreed to produce a written-product , gao will : • notify the requester before a draft-product is sent to the agency for comment and offer the requester a copy of the draft . gao will provide the draft , for informational-purposes , when it is sent to the agency for comment . by law , the senate governmental affairs and house government-reform committees may request a copy of any draft-product generated under gao 's legislative-authority ( research and development-work ) when it is sent to the agency for comment . gao will advise these committees when such drafts are sent to the agency for comment . • allow the requester an option to restrict the release of a product for up to 30-calendar-days after the date the product is issued . this restriction does not preclude the requester from sharing the product with other members . • inform the requester of the option to withdraw sponsorship at any time before the product is submitted for printing . gao reserves the right to issue the product without reference to the requester when sponsorship is withdrawn . if any member is interested in becoming a co-requester of gao work , gao will explain its policy on co-requests and refer the member to the original-requester . if the original-requester agrees , the member can become a co-requester any time before a product is submitted for printing . gao will extend the same commitments to page 9 gao-01-145g gao 's congressional-protocols supporting the congress ' institutional interests co-requesters as to the original-requester ( see commitment to congressional-requesters ) . however , co-requesters can not approve additional-co-requesters or restrict the timing of the release of the product after it is issued . in limited-circumstances , gao may be unable to do the requested work on behalf of a particular-committee or member . these circumstances involve situations in which the request ( 1 ) addresses an important-issue of broad-interest to multiple-committees or the congress as a whole , ( 2 ) involves an issue that is a legislative priority or is on a fast legislative-track , or ( 3 ) asks for a compilation of information which gao has developed from a substantial-body of prior-work and/or work originally requested by others . in such cases , gao will advise the requester that it can not do the work as a request but will instead address the issue as part of gao 's research and development-work . on rare-occasions , the results of ongoing congressionally requested work may be important and relevant to pending-legislation ( e.g. , when gao has information which could inform the legislative debate on the senate or house floor ) or other institutional interests . in such cases , gao reserves the right , after consultation with the requester , to make the information or product generally-available regardless of a restriction placed on its release . in these cases , gao will promptly notify the requesters why , when , and to whom the information or product will be released . notification of ongoing-work for ongoing-work -- except for classified-work and investigations -- gao will disclose , if asked ( e.g. , by members , congressional-staff , agencies , or the press ) , the source of the request and the project 's objectives , scope , and methodology . additionally , all congressional page 10 gao-01-145g gao 's congressional-protocols obtaining-agency-comments offices have , through senate and house intranet-connections to gao , access to the objectives , scope , and methodology of active gao assignments , except for those cases where the reporting of such work would result in disclosing classified or other sensitive information . active-assignments are those that have been staffed . as required by generally accepted-government-auditing standards , gao will hold an exit-conference with agency-officials at the end of the data-collection and analysis-phase to ( 1 ) validate the factual-accuracy of data gathered and ( 2 ) discuss the implications that flow from them . also , gao will give agencies and other directly affected-parties the opportunity to officially comment on a draft-report to which they are a party ( other than reports that largely reflect prior gao work ) . the substance of those comments will be published in the report along with gao 's assessment . gao prefers written comments but will accept oral-comments . although gao may give an agency up to 30-calendar-days to comment , gao may attempt to obtain comments in shorter time-frames , depending on the product-timing-needs of the requester and the complexity of the issues involved . in rare-cases , the comptroller general may grant an extension beyond 30-calendar-days if the agency shows that an extension is necessary and will likely-result in a more accurate-product . gao will not provide an opportunity to comment in cases where ( 1 ) disclosure of an investigation 's results could pose risks to individuals and their confidentiality or ( 2 ) premature-disclosure of information could compromise the results of the work . termination of work if requesters or co-requesters decide to withdraw their support of gao work that will not result in a written-product ( e.g. , a report ) , they may do so at any time . if a written-product has been planned , the requesters or co-requesters must advise gao of their withdrawal before the product is submitted for printing . their withdrawal will not result in the termination of a product if significant-resources have been expended and/or the product is in the public-interest . gao will , under these circumstances , issue a product as if it were undertaken on its own authority . the product may be addressed to committees of jurisdiction or the affected agency . copies of such products will be sent to the committees of jurisdiction and will be available to other interested parties and the public . product release all congressionally requested products will have a targeted-issuance-date . gao will notify requesters approximately 30-calendar-days before they are to receive a product and accommodate their requests for restrictions on the release of the product of up to 30-calendar-days after the issuance-date . gao will grant extensions beyond the 30-calendar-days only in limited-cases ( e.g. , a change in the date of a hearing related to the report ) . gao reserves the right to release any product that has been issued but is under restriction if it is leaked or otherwise made publicly-available . in addition , gao reserves the right to release drafts of products that have been leaked or made publicly-available . in such cases , gao will advise requesters prior to the release . workpaper access gao will grant members , upon their written-request , access to its workpapers at the gao site or will provide copies of selected workpapers only after a product has been made publicly-available . this is subject to legal and privacy-considerations , such as those concerning page 12 gao-01-145g gao 's congressional-protocols requests for testimony taxpayer-return-information , protected-banking-information , grand-jury-information , and credit-card-accounts listed in travel-vouchers . requests for gao testimony should be made by a committee-chair in writing . gao will strive to respond to all congressional-requests for testimony . however , gao will decline an invitation to testify when ( 1 ) gao can not produce a testimony that conforms to its core-values and standards or ( 2 ) the substance of the gao testimony would be new information developed for another committee or member who wants to restrict the information until its public release . in cases of multiple-requests for testimony involving the same subject-matter , gao will testify on the date of the first hearing held and will be available to testify at any subsequent hearings . for testimony based on new work , regardless of whether it is a preliminary or final-product , gao will , consistent with professional-auditing-standards , hold an exit-conference with agency-officials before the written-testimony is completed to ( 1 ) validate the accuracy of data gathered and ( 2 ) discuss the implications that flow from the data . gao will distribute its written-testimony in accordance with the rules of the senate or house , including the committees ' rules , and be available to brief the majority and the minority on material-facts , major-findings , and recommendations relating to any new work . detailees to the congress by law , gao staff can be assigned on detail only to congressional-committees , not to leadership or personal-offices . gao staff may not engage in partisan-activities or discussions . committee-requests for gao detailees should be in writing and be for specific-purposes for a period not to exceed 1 year . all detailees must be approved by the comptroller general in a manner press policy consistent with the applicable-rules and policies of the senate or house . in response to media-inquiries about ongoing-work , gao will provide information only about the objectives , scope , and methodology of an assignment ; the names of the requesters ; and the expected completion-date . gao will refer inquiries for any additional information to the requesters . as a professional-courtesy , gao will inform requesters of substantive-media-inquiries during an ongoing-assignment . once a product is publicly released , gao staff with expertise in the subject-matter will answer questions from the media when asked . on-camera-interviews for television news programs are done only on request and only when gao deems them appropriate for public-understanding of the facts , findings , conclusions , and recommendations of gao products . gao's policy is that senior executives with the broadest knowledge of a completed assignment do such interviews . before gao agrees to do an on-camera-interview , gao will advise the requesters of the media-source and the expected-date and time . if asked to participate in press-briefings sponsored by requesters , gao will provide support if the press-briefing is held in washington , d.c . in such instances , gao will provide knowledgeable-staff with the understanding that they are present only to answer questions about the specifics of released gao products . gao does not hold press-conferences or issue-press releases about products , but it does advise the media and the public of the release of gao products via the world wide web and other venues . investigations gao has an office of special-investigations that ( 1 ) investigates-referrals concerning specific-allegations of federal-fraud , waste , abuse , or misconduct and ( 2 ) conducts specific-projects that require special investigative-tactics . it is gao 's policy to conduct page 14 gao-01-145g gao 's congressional-protocols investigations according to standards established by the president 's council on integrity and efficiency ( pcie ) as adapted for gao 's work . pcie standards place upon gao and its investigators the responsibility to ensure that ( 1 ) investigations are conducted by personnel who collectively possess the required-knowledge , skills , and abilities to perform the investigations , ( 2 ) judgments made in collecting and analyzing-evidence and communicating-results are impartial , and ( 3 ) due professional-care ( e.g. , thoroughness , appropriate-use of investigative-techniques , impartiality , objectivity , protection of individual-rights , and timeliness ) is exercised . gao 's congressional-policies and protocols apply to all investigative-work conducted by the office of special-investigations unless an exception is specified herein or noted in advance . ordering-information the first copy of each gao report is free . additional-copies of reports are $ 2 each . a check or money-order should be made out to the superintendent of documents . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed
