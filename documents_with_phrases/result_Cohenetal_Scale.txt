a measure of scale-economies for postal-systems robert h. cohen u. s. postal-rate commission edward h. chu u.s. environmental-protection agency published in managing-change in the postal-delivery industries , ed . michael a . crew and paul r. kleindorfer , kluwer academic-publishers , 1997 the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of the postal-rate commission or the environmental-protection agency . mr. chu was a professional-staff member of the postal-rate commission from 1993-1995 . a preliminary-version of this paper was presented at wissenschaftliches institut für kommunikationsdienste ( wik ) gmhh , 3rd königswinter seminar , cost of universal-service , november 1995 . introduction the delivery-function is comparatively new to modern postal-services . originally the post was simply an inter-city-letter service . one could deposit a letter at the post-office in a city for transportation to the post-office in another city where the recipient would call for it.1 it was not until the mid-nineteenth century that city-delivery began on a regular basis in the u.s. by the end of the century rural-delivery was started on a limited basis , but it did not become ubiquitous until the early-part of the twentieth-century . delivery changed the post in many ways . no doubt it has been a substantial-cause of the tremendous-growth in volume since its inception . but delivery also changed the economics of the modern post because it introduced a large amount of fixed-costs . while the letter-mail-monopoly preceded the introduction of delivery-service , the fixed-costs associated with delivery-underlie the two modern-justifications for the letter-monopoly . first , it is argued that a letter-mail-monopoly is necessary to assure universal-service at a uniform-price . second , it is argued that delivery is a natural-monopoly and that legal-protection is necessary to prevent '' cream-skimming '' and thereby to maximize the benefit of the universal-delivery system.2 the first argument is a political one which presumes significant urban-rural-cross-subsidizes in delivery . the second is an economic-argument which presumes that the postal-service as a monopolist is an efficient-provider of delivery . the analysis presented here is an attempt to address the second argument . 1 campbell , james i. , jr. , `` an introduction to the history of the postal-monopoly law in the united states , '' the last monopoly , the cato institute , washington , d.c. , 1996 . 2 for purposes of this paper , `` cream-skimming '' refers to concentration on serving only those markets that exhibit lower-than-average-delivery-costs , regardless of the characteristic that causes those costs to be less than average . such characteristics are not confined to network density and could include favorable geographic , demographic , or operational characteristics . for example , in the u.s. , curb delivery is less costly than park and loop-delivery which is less costly than foot delivery . in an unsubsidized postal-system as in the united states , the postal-customer bears all costs of the system . the customer therefore is the beneficiary where return to scale are maximized by having a single-firm ( a monopoly ) provide delivery . on the other hand , monopolies can be harmful to consumers when they protect technically-inefficient behavior , and allow economic-rents to be extracted.3 this paper sets up a framework to examine the following-question : do the economies of scale in the delivery-function exceed the technical-inefficiencies and economic-rents of the postal-service ? in short , does the monopoly-increase or decrease the price of postal-services to postal-customers ? 4 this paper measures the returns to scale of the u.s. delivery-function . it then compares this benefit with the cost that the monopoly imposes on the consumer . because delivery involves so much fixed-cost , it would create a tremendous-barrier to entry even if the legal-monopoly were abolished . thus , it may be that having once enjoyed a de jure monopoly , national-posts would enjoy a de facto monopoly even if the legal one were abolished . 5 this paper provides a quantification of the barrier to entry in the letter-mail-market in the united states caused by high fixed-costs in the delivery-function . this paper next estimates the value of scale in delivery exhibited by 21 national postal-systems based on data from an unpublished-paper which was presented at the 1994 stockholm conference on postal and delivery services.6 7 finally , it compares the estimated-value of scale with an estimate of the wage-premium in each country . 3 it is also claimed that monopolies harm consumers with lower quality of service and by being less innovative than firms which must compete . 4 it is important to distinguish postal-consumers ( i.e. , paying customers ) from recipients of mail . the latter may derive great benefits from a monopoly in the form of services that would not be provided in a competitive postal-environment . these might be called political-rents . consumers , being forced to underwrite the political-rents and any inefficiencies and economic-rents in the system , may be better off in a competitive-environment . 5 this may well be the case in sweden which abolished its monopoly in 1993 . a letter-mail-competitor began-operations in stockholm where it captured 20 percent of the market , but , nonetheless , failed . 6 '' an exploratory quantitative-comparison of postal-administrations in industrial-countries . '' 7 the data for each country is from 1988 and is based on upu statistics which have been verified and revised as necessary based on communications with officials in most of the countries . the uniqueness of the delivery-function we distinguish what is known in the u.s. as the `` in-office '' delivery-function and the street-delivery-function . the former is an extension of mail-processing ; it is where the mail is sorted into the delivery-sequence . `` delivery-function '' as used in this paper refers to street-delivery . recent empirical-research confirms the widely held belief that economies of scale exist in the delivery of mail.8 other functional components of the postal-service are presumed here not to exhibit significant-scale-economies , although this has not been demonstrated . john panzar has characterized street-delivery as a bottleneck function because a single-firm can deliver to a recipient at a lower total-cost than multiple-firms delivering to the same customer . he suggests that processing and transportation of mail do not seem to be characterized by scale-economies , and that they could be provided by competing-firms . under this scenario , he suggests that rates be set to allow nondiscriminatory-access to the monopoly-delivery-service by the firms competing in processing and transportation.9 the postal-rate commission and the u.s . postal-service have implicitly recognized the absence of significant-scale-economies in mail-processing and transportation-functions in the postal-service 's rate-structure . postal-rates in the u.s. allow for a substantial-degree of competition with the postal-service in mailprocessing and transportation . for example , the u.s . postal-service gives sorting and barcoding-discounts to about 40 percent of first-class-letter-volume . mailers perform about 60 percent of this worksharing , while third parties perform the 8 '' natural-monopoly and technological-agnosticism : the case of the u.s . postal-service , '' michael d. bradley and jeff colvin , june , 1995 . 9 panzar , john , `` competition , efficiency , and the vertical-structure of postal-services , '' regulation and the nature of postal and delivery-services , ed . michael a . crew and paul r. kleindorfer , kluwer academic-publishers , 1993. rest.10 11 in some classes , mailers transport much of their mail to downstream locations to take advantage of zoned-rates for transportation . street-delivery-cost while the postal-service collects extensive-data on the cost-behavior of city-delivery-carriers , it collects little-data on the cost-behavior of rural-carriers12 for purposes of this analysis , we assume throughout that rural-delivery-cost behavior is similar to that of city delivery.13 in the u.s. , street-delivery-costs for rural and city-carriers combined comprises 21 percent of total-costs . see table 1 . table 1 usps operational-costs by major function note : nonoperating-costs , such as payments made to the treasury for retroactive-charges are excluded . 10 these third-party-sorters collect mail from mailers , sort and apply barcodes , and deliver the mail to the postal-service for a portion of the discount . in addition , discounts encourage bulk advertising-mailers to sort their mail all the way to the carrier's walk sequence , thereby avoiding the carrier `` in-office '' function . 11 economic-rents in the form of a wage-premium paid by the u.s . postal-service partially explain why mailers and third parties can sort-mail at a lower cost than the postal-service . when third parties compete with the postal-service , however , in highly automated-operations such as applying-barcodes with optical-character-readers and sorting barcoded-mail , a wage-premium would seemingly not be a very significant-factor . 12 the u.s . postal-service has two types of delivery-personnel ; city-delivery-carriers and rural-carriers . in 1993 , there were 164 thousand city-delivery-routes with 80 million-delivery-points and 49 thousand rural-routes with 23 million-delivery-points . rural costs were 20 percent of total-delivery-costs . 13 for example , it is assumed that the ratio of rural-carrier in-office-cost to total rural-carrier-cost is the same as the ratio of city-carrier-in-office cost to total-city carrier-cost . this paper adopts the analysis of street-delivery-costs presented by the u.s . postal-service in several-rate-proceedings over the past 20 years . that analysis disaggregates street-delivery time into three subcomponents : route-time , access-time , and load-time . `` route-time '' is the time it would take a carrier to walk or drive the route , passing , but not accessing , any delivery-point . `` access-time '' is the time it takes a carrier to deviate from the route in order to make a delivery . this may mean departing from the basic-line of travel and walking or driving to a delivery-point and returning to the basic-line of travel , or it may mean slowing down from normal-driving-speed , stopping to make a delivery to a curbside-mail-receptacle , and then resuming normal-speed . finally , '' load-time '' is the time it takes a carrier to place the mail in a mail-receptacle . 14 table 2 disaggregates street-time in the u.s. table 2 note : for simplicity , coverage-related-load-time ( $ 1,232 million ) is included in access-time , and street-support is '' piggybacked '' on all three functions . route-time-costs are essentially fixed , while access is partly-variable , and load-time is 100 percent variable with volume . the analysis of variability of access-time involves estimating the number of new accesses that would be caused by an increment of volume . in the u.s. , approximately 93 percent of all possible-stops receive mail each delivery-day . 15 consequently , the number of new accesses 14 load-time is divided into elemental and coverage related load-time . elemental-load-time varies with the number of pieces being loaded . coverage related load-time is the fixed-portion of load-time at a stop ; it varies with the number of stops . thus , it is partly-variable and partly fixed . 15 a stop consists of one or more possible-deliveries . for example , a 5 unit apartment house with a cluster of 5-mail-boxes would be one stop and 5 possible-deliveries . caused by an increase in volume would be small . regression-analysis of carrier-street-data indicates that at the current volume , the variability of access-cost is about 6 percent . in other words , a 10-percent-increase in volume will yield a 0.6 percent-increase in the number of accesses . the postal-service regularly collects a representative-sample of street-delivery-costs , volumes , and delivery-point-characteristics for city-delivery-carriers . the postal-service 's fy 1993 data-set contains observations from about 300 routes.16 observed every two weeks over a one year period , data is collected from about 270,000 stops . this data is used to model the behavior of access-costs . the coverage-function shown in figure 1 models the change in the percentage of possible-stops that are accessed on a route as a result of changes in volume . 17 marginal-access-cost can be estimated from the coverage-function . as volume per stop grows and coverage approaches 100 percent , the volume-variability of access-cost approaches zero . as the volume per stop-declines , coverage declines , and the volume-variability of access-costs rises . measure of scale-economies our methodology for measuring-scale-economies essentially compares the cost of providing-delivery by a single-firm with the cost of providing-delivery by two firms.18 we measure the returns to scale in the u.s. postal-delivery-function by first determining the total-cost of delivery provided by the postal-service . next , we determine the total-cost of delivery performed by the incumbent and a second firm that is assumed to be equally-efficient . we assume that the two firms share the market equally , each delivering a random-half of the mail . further , each firm serves 16 see the testimony of u.s . postal-service witness bradley in docket no . r94-1 ( usps-t-5 ) at pp . 5-10 . 17 the postal-service developed the coverage-function and first used it in the docket no . r76-1 rate-case . for this paper we have altered the service 's model slightly . unlike the postal service's model , all stop types and mail-classes are consolidated . 18 of course , the cost of providing-delivery by a single-firm could also be compared with the cost of three or more firms . this would simply inflate the measure of scale-economies . the entire-country each delivery-day . thus , each firm would have to incur the same route-time-costs that the incumbent currently incurs . since each firm will have only half the volume , the number of accesses by each firm will be less than the incumbent currently experiences . the number of total-accesses by the two firms will , however , be greater than the total experienced by the incumbent alone . this is because some stops receiving multiple-pieces will receive delivery from both firms . we assume here that both firms provide the same frequency of delivery ( daily ) .19 since route-time is essentially fixed,20 it would double with two firms providing-service , each with half the volume . conversely , because load-time is 100 percent variable with volume , it would not change , since total-volume is assumed not to change . access-cost would fall somewhere in between , since it is partly-variable and partly fixed . access-cost variability is estimated from the coverage-function shown in figure 1 . under the duopoly-scenario described , it would grow by 61 percent . given these responses to volume , total street-time cost would increase from $ 10 billion to $ 16.1 billion . the difference , $ 6.1 billion , represents an upper-bound on the benefits from scale-economies of delivery.21 monopoly-rents and inefficiencies in 1993 , the average u.s. postal-worker-subject to collective bargaining received $ 35,001 in pay and allowances , and an additional $ 7,713 in fringe benefits.22 to put these earnings into perspective , the median annual-earnings 19 a niche incumbent might provide delivery less frequently or to a subset of possible-stops . these would be special-cases of the more general-case analyzed here . 20 the slight-variability the commission has found in route-time is ignored here for convenience . 21 ceteris-paribus , less efficient postal-services do not have greater scale-economies than more efficient-ones . theoretically scale-economies in delivery are not firm-specific . they are a product of the territory served and the current-state of technology which would be employed by an efficient-firm . the $ 6.1 billion figure is inflated by any inefficiency and/or wage-premium which characterize the u.s . postal-service and in that sense it is an upper-bound . 22 the fringe-benefit-figure excludes unfunded civil-service-retirement liability , certain annuitant-benefits , workers-compensation , unemployment-compensation , repriced annual-leave , bonuses and awards . ( without fringe-benefits ) was $ 24,076 for full-time u.s. workers in that year.23 michael b. wachter of the university of pennsylvania and his colleagues conclude that there is a wage and fringe benefit premium for the postal bargaining labor-force of 29.5 percent with respect to comparable-workers in the private sector.24 such a wage-premium would amount to $ 9 billion in monopoly-rents for the entire postal-system . wachter 's $ 9 billion system-wide-wage-premium exceeds the $ 6.1 billion-delivery-scale economy by $ 2.9 billion . wachter 's wage-premium for the delivery-network alone , however , amounts to only $ 2.3 billion which is $ 3.8 billion less than the value of the scale-benefit from delivery . unlike labor costs , technical-inefficiency of the postal-service has not been analyzed . there is , however , some indirect-evidence of inefficiencies in the postal-service . since 1970 , total-factor-productivity has increased at an average annual rate of only 0.4 percent . this is in spite of the fact that little-mechanization existed in the postal-service prior to 1970 and large amounts were added in the 1970s . beginning in the early-1980s and continuing to the present , about $ 5 billion has been invested to automated mail-processing , including the in-office carrier sequence function and forwarding for undeliverable-as-addressed-mail . additional-billions have been invested in buildings , in part to house the automation . in spite of this investment , productivity appears to have increased only in response to hiring-freezes , or reductions in the average wage and fringe-benefit-package caused by special-circumstances . 25 26 23 statistical-abstracts of the u.s. , table 665 , 1994 . 24 '' the comparability of u.s . postal-service wages and benefits to the private sector : evidence from the total-compensation-premium , new hire increases , quit-rates and application-rates , '' michael l wachter , barry t. hirsch , and james w. gillula , july 10 , 1995 . dr. wachter has published a number of studies on the postal service's labor costs under contract to the usps . critics of previous-wachter studies claim that they ignore the fact that the postal-service pays minorities the same as it pays white-males . the critics argue that it is the postal-service 's minority-employees ( not white-male employees ) who earn more than their private-sector-equivalents , and this only means that the postal-service does not discriminate . 25 see `` a study of u.s . postal-service productivity and its measurement , '' staff study of the postal-rate commission , may 9 , 1990 . 26 other indications of inefficiency are management-claims that work-rules are unnecessarily-restrictive and that 73,075 grievances were filed by employees in fy 1995 and not resolved at the local-level . in addition , the postal-service has failed to capture a large-market-share in two areas of direct-competition with the private sector which are relatively-unaffected by the private express-statutes ; parcel-post and express ( overnight ) mail . this may have been in part caused by either a wage-premium or technical-inefficiencies or a combination of both . the postal-service argues that a figure 2 presents the consumer-benefit from delivery-scale economies-net of inefficiencies which are expressed as a percentage of total postal-costs . the top-curve incorporates any wage-premium the postal-service may have , the bottom-curve nets out wachter's 29.5 percent wage-premium . the top-curve shows that if the postal-service has 0-percent-inefficiencies with its current-wage-premium , the measure of scale-economies equal $ 6.1 billion . if the postal-service were about 13 percent inefficient , there would be zero net-scale-benefit . the bottom-curve shows that at 0-percent-inefficiencies , the net-scale-benefit is - $ 2.9 billion if the value of scale is adjusted for wachter 's wage-premium . any inefficiency would exacerbate the loss . if the wage-premium is accurately calculated by professor wachter , it would be difficult to defend the u.s. postal-monopoly on purely economic-grounds . moreover , understanding the net economic-cost of the monopoly allows one to see how much universal-service costs postal-customers , at least under current institutional-arrangements . figure 3 presents the same information considering the street function alone . wachter 's wage-premium amounts to only $ 2.3 billion for the delivery-function alone . thus , the net-scale-benefit is initially-positive , whether or not we adjust for the wage-premium . it is far more likely that a monopoly for delivery alone would produce net-benefits for consumers than would a monopoly that included processing and transportation as well as delivery . this result lends support to the panzar 's suggestion of opening processing and transportation to competition while maintaining a monopoly in delivery . lack of pricing-flexibility has contributed to the postal-service 's failure . others argue that the quality of service , product-features , and underlying-cost of these postal service's offerings make them uncompetitive . barriers to entry because a large-proportion of street-costs are fixed,27 the unit ( per piece ) street-cost initially declines rapidly as volume-increases and continues to decline at a decreasing-rate . a firm with a small-share of total-volume that competes with an incumbent in delivery only , will find its unit-cost high relative to the incumbent , even if the competitor pays no wage-premium and or is more efficient . a competitor can reduce its fixed-costs by reducing the level of service ( i.e. , deliver less frequently than the incumbent ) . many first-class-mailers do not require daily-delivery and most advertising-mailers do not require daily-delivery . while it may be politically-difficult , incumbent postal-administrations have the possibility of reducing-delivery frequency . table 3 displays the cost-savings if the u.s . postal-service were to reduce delivery-frequency . the savings are substantial relative to the current $ 10 billion delivery-costs . they are not so substantial when considered in the context of the total postal-service expenditure in 1993 of $ 48 billion . table 3 cost of delivery-frequency table 4 illustrates how difficult it would be to enter the u.s. delivery market.28 the table displays the market share that a competitor would have to capture in order 27 in the u.s. , about 71 percent of street-cost are fixed . 28 over and above the problems discussed here , the u.s. mail-box-law represents a huge-barrier to entry . the law forbids any private party from placing-anything in a receptacle used to deliver mail to a residence or business . to have the same unit-costs as the u.s . postal-service . for example , if a competitor delivered six days a week and its combined wage and efficiency-advantage is 50 percent , the competitor would have to capture 35 percent of the total-market in order to have the same unit-delivery cost as the postal-service . even if this competitor delivered only one day per week , it would have to capture 15 percent of the total-market in order to have the same unit-delivery cost as the postal-service on a national-basis . this is about 27 billion pieces per year or 519 million pieces per week . assuming a competitor would capture volume slowly and would have to charge-rates no higher than the incumbent , the competitor would have to be ready to sustain large loses before it could break even . thus , the effects of economies of scale in delivery-present significant-barriers to entry . table 4 break-even market share for competitors competitor combined wage and efficiency-advantage an international-comparison of the values of scale in delivery with wage-premiums as mail-volume-increases in postal-systems , variable-costs ( processing and transportation ) increase and fixed-costs-decrease as a percentage of total-costs . therefore , street-delivery-costs , which are largely fixed , decrease as a percentage of total-costs as volume-increases . route-time-cost , which is a fixed-cost and the largest component of street-delivery-costs , decreases with a rise in volume . the fixed-access-cost as a percentage of total-cost would increase with volume until all stops are covered while the variable access-cost percentage decreases as volume-increases . figure 4 shows these relationships for the u.s . postal-service costs . conversely as volumes decrease , fixed-costs become a higher percentage of total-costs . for example , if the u.s . postal-service volume were one third of the 1993 level , then delivery-costs as a percentage of total-costs would increase from approximately 21 percent to 36 percent of total-costs . in equally-efficient but smaller volume postal-systems , street-delivery-costs should also be a much greater percentage of total-costs than the 21 percent in the u.s . postal-service . table 5 displays the implied coverage , the percentage of total-cost represented by street-delivery-cost , and the percentage of total-cost represented by fixed delivery-cost for the 21 countries based on their respective per capita-volume in 1988 . 29 for example , germany had about 230 pieces per capita which yields a coverage of about 64 percent . its per capita-volume and corresponding-coverage imply that its fixed-portion of delivery equaled about 19 percent of its total-costs . the u.s. , by comparison , had about 535 pieces per capita and had 91 percent coverage for 1988 . thus , the fixed-portion of delivery in the u.s. amounted to about 14 percent of total-cost . the implied coverages range from 16 percent to nearly 100 percent . the implied proportions of fixed delivery-cost tot total-cost ranged from 12 percent to 43 percent . this assumes that the coverage-function ( figure 1 ) , developed from an analysis of delivery-routes in the u.s. , is valid for the other countries included in this analysis . table 5 fixed-delivery-costs note : assumes fixed-costs are incurred only in the delivery-function . all other functions are assumed to vary with volume . for each of the 21 countries in the international-data set described above , we calculate the value of scale in the delivery-function using the same approach we used for the u.s. with a slight-modification . for the u.s. , we calculate the value of scale by comparing the cost of a hypothetical-duopoly with the cost of a monopoly . this is calculated using-volume per possible-stops-data and the coverage-function . for the other 20 countries , we use a slightly-different approach because detailed-street delivery-cost and point of delivery-data are not available . we use volume per capita as a proxy for pieces per possible-stop and assume that the street-delivery-cost to total-cost-relationship of the u.s. is the same for the other 20 countries . see the technical appendix for a more detailed-discussion of the methodology . using the 1988 data , we use the per capita-volume for each country to approximate-pieces per possible-stop . we assume a direct linear-relationship between volume per capita and pieces per possible-stop . using the estimates of pieces per possible-stop for each country , we then calculate the monopoly and the duopoly-costs based on the u.s. costs . we then take the ratio of the value of scale to the monopoly-cost and multiply that ratio by the actual total-costs for each country to estimate the value of scale for each country . for example , for the united kingdom , the value of scale is about $ 4.46 billion using the u.s. model . in 1988 , the total-cost for the postal-service was about $ 36.5 billion . when we adjust the total-cost for the united kingdom 's coverage-level , the total-cost would be about $ 26.7 billion . if we assume that all cost-segments other than street-delivery vary with volume , the value of scale is about 17 percent of the total-cost at the united kingdom 's volume and coverage-levels . we then apply the 17-percent-estimate to the united kingdom 's actual total-cost for 1988 ( $ 6.58 billion ) to calculate the value of scale.30 the value of scale for the united kingdom is about $ 1.1 billion . table 6 displays the estimates of value of scale for the 21 countries in our data-set . the value of scale ranges from $ 14 million for luxembourg to $ 4.5 billion for the u.s. a measure of a wage-premium can be calculated for each country by comparing the postal hourly-wage with the average-manufacturing wage in that country.31 it should be noted that belgium , finland and spain have a negative-wage-premium according to this measure . the net-value of scale is the difference between the value of scale and the wage-premium . 30 the total-costs for national postal-systems other than the u.s. are expressed in purchasing-power-parities . 31 the postal-data for calculating the wage-premium comes from the above mentioned paper . the private-sector-data comes from international-comparisons of hourly-compensation-costs for production-workers in manufacturing , 1993 , u.s. department of labor , bureau of labor statistics , report 873 , june 1994 . table 6 comparison of value of scale in delivery with the wage-premium in 21 national postal-systems ( $ millions - 1988 ) note : expressed in u.s. dollars based on purchasing-power-parities . if the wage-premium-measure is valid , then seven countries have a wage-premium alone which exceeds the value of scale in the delivery-function ; australia , austria , france , japan , luxembourg , switzerland and the united states . in these countries , it appears that it would be difficult to justify a postal-delivery-monopoly based on economic-grounds . better understanding of inefficiencies in national postal-systems would allow further evaluation of the economic-basis for the postal-monopoly in the remaining countries.32 sweden and finland do not have legal-monopolies . technical appendix a. estimating the coverage-function 1 . data we use the fy 1993 data from the postal-service 's city-carrier system ( ccs ) to model the behavior of access-costs . the ccs data-base contains a representative-sample of street-delivery-costs , volumes , and delivery-point-characteristics for city-delivery-carriers . the ccs fy 1993 data-set contains observations from about 300 routes . the postal-service sampled each route every two weeks over a one year period resulting in about 8,000 route-level observations . 2 . the coverage-model for this paper , we use a nonlinear-regression-model that establishes the relationship between volume and coverage . we define '' coverage '' as the percentage of stops on a route that receive mail . it has been well established that route-coverages relate directly to the fixed and variable-nature of access-cost . the coverage-model specification is as follows : covi = 1 - e -b*ppsi ( 1 ) where , covi = asi / psi asi = number of actual-stops on route i psi = number of possible-stops on route i ppsi = number of pieces per possible-stop on route i since coverage can not exceed 100 percent , we have specified an exponential-function . the regression-results from the model are highly-significant . the estimated-coefficient , b , is 0.6587 . b . measure of scale-economies 1 . scale-economies for the u.s. we measure the returns to scale in the u.s. postal-delivery-function by first determining the total-cost of delivery provided by the postal-service : scm = rcm + ecm + fm * acm + vm * acm ( 2 ) where , scm = street-delivery-cost rcm = route-time-cost ecm = elemental-load-cost acm = access-cost ( also includes coverage-related-load-cost ) vm = variable-portion of access-cost = ( ( e -b*pps * ( b * pps ) / ( 1 - e -b*pps ) ) ) fm = fixed-portion of access-cost = ( 1 - vm ) m = designates the monopoly-case for the year 1993 , street-delivery-cost totaled about $ 10.07 billion : scm = rcm + ecm + fm * acm + vm * acm ( 2 ) = 2.95 + 1.91 + 0.8 ( 5.20 ) + 0.2 ( 5.20 ) = 10.07 next , we determine the total-cost of delivery performed by the postal-service and a second firm that we assume to be equally-efficient . we calculate the cost for each of the two firms in our hypothetical-duopoly by adjusting-equation ( 2 ) : scfirmi = rcm + 0.5 * ecm + ffirmi * acfirmi + vfirmi * acfirmi ( 3 ) where , scfirmi = street-delivery-cost for firm i acfirmi = access-cost for firm i = acm * ncov ncov = new coverage a duopoly-firm i = 1 - ( covm - covd ) covm = coverage for a monopoly = 1 - e -b*pps covi = coverage for a duopoly-firm i = 1 - e -b*pps/2 vfirmi = variable-portion of access-cost = ( ( e -b*pps/2 * ( b * pps/2 ) / ( 1 - e -b*pps/2 ) ) ) ffirmi = fixed-portion of access-cost = ( 1 - vfirmi ) the total-delivery-cost for the duopoly-market is simply scduopoly = 2 scfirmi ( 4 ) for the year 1993 , total street-delivery-costs for the hypothetical-duopoly in the u.s. are as follows : scfirmi = rcm + 0.5 * ecm + f * acfirmi + v * acfirmi ( 3 ) = 2.95 + 0.5 ( 1.91 ) + 0.52 ( 4.19 ) + 0.48 ( 4.19 ) = 8.098 scduopoly = 2 scfirmi ( 4 ) = 2 * 8.098 = 16.2 value of scale= scduopoly - scm = 16.2 - 10.1 = 6.1 the value of scale in the u.s. is approximately $ 6.1 billion . in 1993 , the total-cost for the postal-service was about $ 48.2 billion . if we assume that all cost-segments other than street-delivery ( i.e. , in-office-delivery , mail-processing , transportation , retail-services , and other costs ) vary with volume , the value of scale amounts to about 13 percent of the total-cost . 2 . scale-economies for 21 postal-systems1 for each of the 20 countries ( other than the u.s. ) described above , we use a slightly-different approach because detailed-street delivery-cost and point of delivery-data are not available . we use volume per capita as a proxy for pieces per possible-stop and assume that the street-delivery-cost to total-cost-relationship of the u.s. is the same for the other 20 countries . first , we use volume per capita for each country to approximate-pieces per possible-stop . we assume a direct linear-relationship between volume per capita and pieces per possible-stop : ppsi = ( vci / vcu.s . ) * ppsu.s . ( 5 ) where , ppsi = average-pieces per possible-stop for country i ppsu.s . = average-pieces per possible-stop for the u.s. vci = volume per capita for country i vcu.s . = volume per capita for the u.s. for the united kingdom , for example , we estimate an average of 1.8 pieces per possible-stop ( with a corresponding-coverage of about 69 percent ) : ppsi = ( vci / vcu.s . ) * ppsu.s . ( 5 ) = ( 264/536 ) * 3.66 = 0.49 * 3.66 = 1.8 1in contrast to the previous-section , all data in this section are from the year 1988 . using the estimates of pieces per possible-stop for each country , we calculate the monopoly-cost and the duopoly-cost using-equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) based on the u.s. costs . for example , for the united kingdom , equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) would result in the following-results : scm = rcm + ecm + fm * acm + vm * acm ( 2 ) = 2.95 + 0.94 + 0.48 ( 4.08 ) + 0.52 ( 4.08 ) = 7.98 scfirmi = rcm + 0.5 * ecm + f * acfirmi + v * acfirmi ( 3 ) = 2.95 + 0.5 ( 0.94 ) + 0.27 ( 2.78 ) + 0.73 ( 2.78 ) = 6.22 scduopoly = 2 scfirmi ( 4 ) = 2 * 6.22 = 12.44 value of scale= scduopoly - scm = 12.44 - 7.98 = 4.46 the value of scale is about $ 4.46 billion using the u.s. model . in 1988 , the total-cost for the postal-service was about $ 36.5 billion . when we adjust the total-cost for the united kingdom's coverage-level , the total-cost would be about $ 26.7 billion . if we assume that all cost-segments other than street-delivery vary with volume , the value of scale is about 17 percent of the total-cost at the united kingdom 's volume and coverage-levels . we then apply the 17-percent-estimate to the united kingdom 's actual total-cost for 1988 ( $ 6.58 billion ) to calculate the value of scale . the value of scale for the united kingdom is about $ 1.1 billion .
