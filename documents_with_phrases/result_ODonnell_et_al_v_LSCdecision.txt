'' we determined that the first cort factor was controlling : lenders affected by the lobbying-activities of lsc grantees were not `` part of any special class to be benefitted by '' the lsca . reg'l mgmt. , 186 f.3d at 463 ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) . rather , we noted that congress specifically intended the lsca to benefit `` indigents who have legal grievances but who are unable to afford the legal-means necessary to redress them . '' id . ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) . o'donnell v. eidleman the reasoning of regional management is controlling here . as we held in regional management , the lsca was intended by congress for the `` especial-benefit '' of indigent-persons in need of legal-services . although legal-services-programs such as ccls are an integral part of the process of delivering those services , the programs themselves are not the beneficiaries of the act . because ccls is not part of the class congress sought to benefit in enacting the lsca , we must conclude that congress did not intend to imply a private-cause of action by ccls to challenge the lsc's exercise of its statutory and regulatory-duties . * iii . for the reasons set forth above , we conclude that the district-court was without authority to review the actions of the lsc . accordingly , we vacate the order of the district-court and remand with instructions to dismiss . vacated and remanded with instructions *we note that three other circuits have concluded that rational basis judicial-review is available for decisions of the lsc that affect grantees . see tex . rural legal-aid , inc. v. legal servs . corp. , 940 f.2d 685 , 697 ( d.c. cir . 1991 ) ; san juan legal servs. , inc. v. legal servs . corp. , 655 f.2d 434 , 438-39 ( 1st cir . 1981 ) ; spokane county legal servs. , inc. v. legal servs . corp. , 614 f.2d 662 , 668-69 ( 9th cir . 1980 ) . we find these cases distinguishable for the reasons stated in regional management . see reg'l mgmt. , 186 f.3d at 464 .
