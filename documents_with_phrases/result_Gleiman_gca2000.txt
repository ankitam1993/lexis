before the graphics communications association chicago , illinois december 6 , 2000 good-morning-ladies and gentlemen . this is the third time i have participated in a graphics communications association conference . my first gca conference was in february of 1997 , the 17th to be precise , in coral gables , florida . norm scharf lured me to florida with promises of sunshine , warm-temperatures and the chance to follow gene del polito on a panel . it was cloudy , the temperature never got above 45 degrees fahrenheit and , after listening to gene proselytize about postal-reform , i tried to enlist ! earlier this year , norm invited me to the april 14th gca conference in clearwater , florida . `` how could i resist , '' he asked , '' a chance to get a head-start on my summer-tan ? '' it rained -- -the entire-time ! when norm called in june to ask if i would participate in an r2000-1 postmortem conference , i agreed on the condition that ( 1 ) i speak before gene and ( 2 ) that i not be subjected to florida's erratic-weather . norm , i see that gene 's performance is tomorrow -- -afternoon . so , i want to thank you on meeting my first condition . on your meeting my other condition , what can i say norm but thank you . it certainly is a pleasure to be here in chicago -- -in december ! now before you get upset with me , i think you need to know the real-reason we are in chicago -- -in december . how many of you know neal denton ? neal who is on the program-tomorrow -- -with gene -- -is rabid . oops , i mean he is a rabid-baseball-fan . so much so that he tries to see at least one game at each major-league-diamond every year . well , as i heard the story , denton was leaning into the plate in fantasy-baseball-camp last-winter when he took a high , inside , fast-ball on the head . ever since he has been more confused than usual . apparently he thought the cubbies and the chisox had a home and home-inter-league series this week . so , he convinced norm to hold the conference out here so he could get a `` two-fer '' on that every ballpark every year deal . by the way , for those of you who want the straight-skinny on why i 'm leaving the commission , that 's denton 's fault , too ! he told me that there is a `` three strikes and you 're out '' rule for commissioners on omnibus-rates-cases . and , judging from the comments some of you have been making , it appears that i didn't make it to first base in the r2000-1 game . i 've got to tell you , though , that most industry-comments pale by comparison to some of the suggestions i received from the general-public on what i can do with the 34-cent-stamp . seriously , though , i know some of you are not all that happy with a number of the commission 's recommendations . i will speak to some of the concerns of which i have become aware . and , while i do not mean to suggest that i view anyone 's concerns as being parochial , i think it might be useful to set the broader stage of postal-ratemaking -- -to lay out the general-principles that guide the commission 's conclusions . i also plan to spend a few minutes discussing the state of usps finances and mention a couple of other matters of more than passing-interest -- -at least to me , and i hope to you . the law that established the us postal-service in 1970 provides that the postal-service may , from time to time , request that the postal-rate commission recommend `` rates and fees [ that ] shall provide sufficient-revenue so that the total estimated income…to the postal-service will equal as nearly as practicable the total estimated-costs of the postal-service . '' but the commission is n't-free to make just any old recommendations so long as the numbers add up . it has to act in accordance with the general-policies set forth in the postal-reorganization act and nine specific-ratemaking-factors . § 3622 . rates and fees ( 1 ) the establishment and maintenance of a fair and equitable schedule ; ( 2 ) the value of the mail-service actually provided each class or type-ofmail-service to both the sender and the recipient , including but not limited to the collection , mode of transportation , and priority of delivery ; ( 3 ) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail-service bearthe direct and indirect postal-costs attributable to that class or type plus that portion of all other costs of the postal-service reasonably-assignable to such class or type ; ( 4 ) the effect of rate-increases upon the general-public , business-mailusers , and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail-matter other than letters ; ( 5 ) the available-alternative-means of sending and receiving letters andother mail-matter at reasonable-costs ; ( 6 ) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal systemperformed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing-costs to the postal-service ; ( 7 ) simplicity of structure for the entire-schedule and simple , identifiablerelationships between the rates or fees charged the various-classes of mail for postal-services ; ( 8 ) the educational , cultural , scientific , and informational value to therecipient of mail-matter ; and ( 9 ) such other factors as the commission deems appropriate . factor-number three deserves special-mention as it is the mandatory-factor . it is at the heart of many a difference of opinion between the prc and the service , the service and mailers , mailers and the prc , and between groups of mailers . it is the factor that causes the commission to examine all operational-costs , from collection to delivery and the processing that takes place in between . it is the bedrock on which rates are based . each subclass must generate sufficient-revenue to cover its costs . this policy is important for another reason . it , combined with factor-number six , forms the basis for the many , important work-sharing-discounts that are on the books . it seems to me that , at times , critics of commission recommendations tend to take lightly the considerations embodied in 39 usc 3622 ( b ) ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) . `` how come , '' they ask , `` did we wind up with an increase that was larger than that proposed by the usps , when almost-everyone else got a break ? '' there are usually a number of reasons that situations like this occur . for example , the commission believes that costs vary more directly with volume than does the usps . as a consequence , the prc costing-methodology generally attributes a larger portion of total-operating-costs than does the service . but why not even things out by ignoring-cost-differentials between , say , letters and flats ; cost-differential put on the table by the usps a decade ago ? why not just look the other way on these cost-differences , or level the playing field by passing on to some mail 300 percent of costs avoided by work-sharing ? why not give discounts based on cost-avoidances promised in a previous-rate or classification-case but which savings were never captured by the postal-service ? because it is one thing to encourage work-sharing , but quite another to ignore the law , and give revenue away . and , giving-away-revenue has an effect . keep in mind the requirement that a subclass has to generate revenue to cover its costs . now , what happens when we give excessive-discounts for some type of mail ? simple ! we have to make up the revenue from other mail , for example , by bumping up , if you will , the benchmark from which those discounted rates are measured . one rather formidable-group of mailers whose members will benefit mightily from the commission 's recommendations , the periodicals mailers , pointed out in a press-statement that the overall-average increase for first-class-mail was much smaller than the average-increase for mail their members send . does it matter that the cost of processing their mail went way up and the cost of processing first-class-mail declined ? yes . by law , it must matter to the commission ! what if the commission chose to ignore this divergence in costs and hit first-class-mail with a larger increase ? whose interest would be served by our doing so and for how long ? prc r2000-1 ( dollars in millions ) total-contribution to institutional-costs : $ 25,453 package other service 7.15 % 0.89 % $ 1,820 percent-contribution to percent institutional percent volume revenue-cost total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.00 % 1/ includes priority mail i want you to take a moment to look at this pie-chart . i think it is important for everyone to understand the extent to which first-class-mail is already carrying a disproportionate-share of the institutional-cost or overhead-burden of the postal-system . now , forget about this rate-case and put aside any notion that i am suggesting-others-mailers should pay a larger share . think instead about the discussion -- -the hand wringing -- - that has been taking place since the fall of last year when the general-accounting-office unveiled an assessment prepared for the postal-service by a postal-service contractor concerning the extent to which transaction-mail -- -first-class mail -- -is likely to fall prey to electronic-bill-presentment and payment . should we load up on that type of mail -- -give it heftier-increases ? might not doing so just accelerate the departure of this mail from the system ? when that mail leaves the system , who gets to eat that big-slice of the institutional-cost-pie that first-class-mail currently enjoys ? now , remember a few minutes ago when i talked about the commission and postal-service difference of opinion on the matter of how costs vary with volume ? in the usps view of the world , institutional-costs are a larger share of total-costs and fewer costs can be expected to be shed , if and when , say , transaction-mail leaves the system . this means , potentially , an even bigger slice of institutional-pie for someone else -- -one of you , to swallow . not a pleasant-prospect and not one easily avoided -- -not even by any reform-package or proposal that i 've seen . well , i guess i have already crossed the line and gotten into some specifics of the r20001-case . and , i did not paint a horrific picture of the future , just so you might think the present prc recommendation ai n't so bad , after all . however , before i lose the forest -- -and a very important one it is -- -for the trees , i want to step back a bit . in my almost seven years at the helm of the prc , if i have learned-nothing else , i 've learned that each case presents a new challenge . in this case the challenge lay in evaluating the service 's request for additional-funds over and above its expected operating expenses . last january the postal-service proposed an array of rate-increases designed to generate an additional $ 2.8 billion in revenue . what was unusual about this request was that roughly $ 1.7 billion of these dollars was for a contingency , a hedge against the unknown -- -to cover unforeseen-events . another quarter billion plus dollars of the total-amount sought was earmarked to pay down operating-debt accrued in past-years . the size of the contingency quickly became a cause-celebre with many parties to the rate-case . they sponsored-evidence challenging the need for a cushion so substantially above and beyond the postal-service 's own best estimate of future-increases in the cost of collecting , processing and delivering the mail . and , as you probably know , in presenting-estimates of its future-needs , the postal-service used financial and operational-data from fiscal year 1998 as a benchmark . unfortunately , by the time the service filed its request , fiscal year 1999 had already come and gone . the commission requested and the postal-service completed an update of its original-cost-projections in mid-july . to give you a flavor of the impact of this updating-effort , which allowed the commission to use more recent-information than was in the service 's initial-package , let 's look at a few of the changes : • notwithstanding the comments of one of the postal governors at the november board-meeting about not being able to recover increased-fuel-costs and the need for flexibility to permit them to level a fuel-surcharge , the usps was able to factor into the update the increased costs of fueling its delivery fleet . • despite the comments of a governor concerning-costs associated with the nalc arbitration , the usps was able to include these additional-labor-costs in the update . • it also was able to take account of the dollars associated with actual-cost-of-living-adjustments , health insurance and the like , which were higher than earlier projected figures . but the update was not one-sided , only adding new costs , some $ 450 million . the postal-service also presented additional-revenue and costing-cutting-initiatives , such as the billion-dollar-a-year '' break through productivity-plan '' announced by the postmaster general this past-spring . unfortunately , the postal-service was only willing to commit to saving slightly more than one half the highly publicized , promised-amount . the one item that did not change in the postal-service update was the contingency . the $ 1.7 billion remained . the many parties who had already argued that a $ 1.7 billion contingency was unreasonable before the update , were absolutely certain that amount was unjustified given the incorporation of new cost-data and shorter time frame for prognosticating . the evidence presented by the parties on the contingency-issue was determinative . my colleagues and i , reduced the requested amount by $ 700 million , leaving a $ 1 billion contingency . we concluded that this amount more than met the reasonableness standard of the law . now , you should know that i put these remarks together over the weekend , before the december board-meeting that took place monday and tuesday of this week . so , i had no idea of what action the governors might take . it would not surprise me , however , if the governors returned the case because we cut the contingency , if for no other reason than that the usps views the contingency as its private-sandbox and does n't want the prc playing there . nevertheless , i think the governors should be quite-happy with a billion-dollar-contingency since , after all , at the board-meeting -- -at least some of the governors apparently did not even know there was a contingency-provision . one governor is said to have remarked at the public-meeting that he thought the postal-service needed some mechanism for recovering-unforeseen expenses ! you have already heard the doom and gloom-projections about usps finances generally and about this recommended-decision not providing the postal-service with sufficient-revenue to breakeven in the current fiscal year . but think about this : if rate-increases are implemented in january -- -which the service has indicated is likely -- -and the service 's best estimate from just this past july is on target , the postal-service should be sitting on a sizable cushion at the end of this fiscal year . put another way , based on the evidence the postal-service put on the record during rebuttal hearings as recently as this past august 30th , in the absence of the occurrence of unforeseen-events costing more than -- -the portion of the full $ 1 billion contingency earned when new rates are implemented in january , $ 600 million , the service should do quite well with what we recommend . this is , i believe , a good-point to do a comparison of the evidentiary-record the commission based its decision on and the financial-picture postal-officials are now painting just three months later . unexplained-change in usps fy 2001 financial posit ion unexplained-change in usps fy2001 financial position ( $ millions ) net income prc r2000-1 rate decision - 11/13/00 1,342 impact of jan. 2001 delayed rate implementation ( 658 ) adjusted fy 2001 net income 684 operating-plan - 11/14/00 ( 480 ) ( expected net loss ) unexplained-swing in net income : ( 1,164 ) ( 11/13/00 compared to 11/14/00 ) i have a couple of tables i want to share with you . each carries the title `` unexplained-change in usps fy 2001 financial-picture . '' the first table is based on usps-assumptions regarding-rates , costs , volumes , contingency and recovery of prior years' losses . • when the service filed its case last january , we all were told the net income for fy2001 , after covering increased operating costs , would be $ 1.9 billion -- - $ 1.7 billion for the contingency and $ 250 million for recover of prior-years-losses . • when the service filed its july update , which it could have modified during rebuttal in late august , we were told the net income for fy2001 would be $ 1.5 billion . • when you adjust those figures for a january implementation , you get a positive $ 630 million on the bottom line . • but the usps operating-plan presented to and approved by the board in mid-november shows a deficit of almost $ 500 million even if the commission had rubber-stamped the original service request . • when ones-substitutes generally lower prc-rates and uses all other usps-assumptions , one still gets a positive , albeit much smaller , bottom line -- -the $ 132 million figure . • going from a plus $ 630 million to a minus $ 480 million is a swing of $ 1.1 billion . the second table shows the numbers using prc-assumptions and recommended rates . so , regardless of whether one uses the service 's updated assumption or the commission 's rates and assumptions , there has been an unexplained-swing of $ 1.1 billion in the projected bottom line for fy 2001 in just a couple of months ! • were the july-august-updates that far off target ? we now know one figure , the fy2000 ink was not as red as the usps thought it would be -- -the loss is $ 199 million as opposed to the $ 325 million they projected last july . but that 's good ! • are the november operating-plan-figures wrong ? • has that usps commitment for half the promised `` break though productivity '' fallen through ? • has something else happened ? • if so , what is the explanation ? i know that some of you are unhappy with the commission's recommendations as they relate to your mail . i do n't mean to be glib about your concerns , but if i were you , i might be more concerned about the near-term-rate-implications of this $ 1.1 bottom line-swing . for those of you who have only disdain for the current ratemaking-process -- -the length of time it takes and the cost of litigation -- -please keep in mind that the prc process affords the only opportunity you may have to truly scrutinize this swing before you get the next $ 1.1 billion plus kick in your billfold . now , about our recommended rates : could we have made different recommendations ? most certainly ! would they have been better recommendations ? maybe ! but let 's look at the score-card on how the several-classes made out : • by our count , roughly 87 percent of standard mail will have rates that are less than or equal to those proposed by the postal-service . • almost all periodical-mail-rates will be lower than those proposed by the postal-service . • the average-increase in parcel-post , save the not so small-matter of a non-machinable-surcharge that impacts about 3 percent of total-volume , is on target with the usps request . • priority mail , bound printed matter and media mail -- -gosh i 'm having a hard time keeping up with all these name changes -- -took a bit of a hit , 1 percent more , give or take , than the usps requested , based primarily on cost-updates . • nonprofits benefited from last-minute-legislation and will have smaller increases than would have otherwise been the case . however , we did not , as you know , lower the standard-pound-rate as much as the service wanted and we did not raise the breakpoint . to those who choose to be supercritical of the commission regarding our recommendations in these areas , i hope you will consider that ratemaking generally involves a zero-sum-situation where one works against a revenue-target . lowering-pound-rates or raising breakpoints may benefit some mailers , but it will also have a negative impact on others who find themselves dealing , for example , with higher piece-rates and the like . i have a host of one-liners i 've collected over the years that i thought about using at this point in response to some of these critics who think we missed a `` no-brainer , '' but i wo n't do that . one will suffice . it 's the one that comes to mind when i think about how smart i was before i actually had to deal first hand with an omnibus-rate-case . it 's the h.l . mencken line i 've used before : '' for ever problem there is a solution that is simple , neat , plausible and wrong ! '' let 's see now , where am i ? • lay out guiding-principles . check ! • talk about rate-recommendations . check ! • usps finances-the $ 1.1 billion swing . check ! • saw-barrel off shotgun and fire at critics . check ! • i 'm forgetting-something . ah , those other matters of passing-interest . i 'll try not to take too long , but i get to do this because this may be my last-shot as chairman of the prc . and , you know what they say -- -today a peacock-tomorrow a feather-duster ! so , here goes- ( 1 ) postal or legislative-reform or whatever you want to call it : i am not opposed to postal-reform ! i just believe , to quote his february 28 , 2000 , mids article , that that great american , mr. cary baer , had it right when he said , `` before we develop solutions we need to reach some consensus on the problem . '' we 've all got our campaign-ribbons from the war of hr22 . some people want to pick up that very tattered-battle-flag , put on their brightest red-coats , form into straight-lines and march one more time up jenkin 's hill . for those of you who may not know , jenkin 's hill is the hill on which sits the u.s. capitol . price-caps may sound more attractive with every passing-rate-case . but , as i have tried to explain to some of you , costs trumped-caps in hr22 ; that is , you were still likely to see increases akin to those you experience under current-law . i propose that , rather than charging up the same hill with the same old , tired-ammunition , let 's all of us regroup -- -and rethink . dilbert-kind of sums it up for me when it comes to postal-reform . ( 2 ) a better bet for legislation in the 107th congress , and one that may be as important to the postal-community as some perceive postal-reform to be , is in the privacy-area dealing with the collection and sharing of personal-data . this is an area i know a bit about from a previous-incarnation as the point-man on information-policy at the then department of hew in the 1970s . overly restrictive-privacy-legislation at the federal-level or , even worse , 50 different restrictive-state-bills could spell disaster for everyone up and down the chain from graphics and copy people to printers to cataloguers to envelope manufactures to banks and to shipping and logistics-companies . you 've got a split congress and an issue with bipartisan-appeal . convincing conservatives of the benefits of federal-preemption and liberals of the benefits of limiting-causes of action , both stumbling-blocks in the past , might be doable as 107th-searches for common-ground . the result could be a framework-everyone can live with . ( 3 ) negotiated service-agreements . setting aside for the moment the pros and cons of notice versus pre-approval , for some time now i have been preaching that nsos are by and large-nothing more that narrowly drawn or niche-classifications . we 've already approved several such usps-proposals . i urge the service to move forward with whatever proposals they have developed . if mailers , a small group of or even one of them , can perform some task that may drive costs out of the system , let 's get on with it -- -now ! ( 4 ) and last but not least , another ed gleiman suggestion -- -i try to include at least one classification and/or cost-savings proposal in each speech . this one is buried in a concurring-opinion to the r2000-1 decision . certified-mail is costly to the postal-service and the consumer . along with return receipt , also not cheap , these oldfashioned-offerings are frequent recipients of criticism from users . delivery-confirmation , on the other hand , is a high tech , low-cost-service that works and works well . by extending-delivery-confirmation to first-class-mail as a replacement for certified-mail , the potential exists to drive in excess of $ 300 million per year in window-clerk and letter-carrier costs from the system . i could be wrong about all this , and i don't want to fall into my old buddy h. l. mencken 's simple-solutions trap , but that 's a heap of money , and i think this one deserves some prompt-consideration by the folks at postal hq ! it 's pretty-clear that some of you are tired of hearing from me and others , i gather from the snoring , are just plain-tired . so , i best wrap-things up . when i talked with bill hoyt the other day , he said i was obligated to wrap up with a story or joke . i told him i did n't have any new material . he offered that hardly-anyone ever listens to what i say anyway , so you all would not even know that i was recycling old material . let 's see if he is right . john nolan and i were talking about some of his responsibilities . you know all those letters that kids write to santa . well , seems bill henderson used to handle the responses , personally . bill has delegated that and now those letters all go to john . turns out that bill got one letter last year that just tore at his heartstrings . a little-boy wrote that since his father's death , his mother was having a hard time making-ends meet . the little-fellow asked-nothing for himself , only that santa send his mother $ 100 . well , the pmg , being the kind-soul that he is , reach in his pocket , pulled out one of those nice , crisp , new $ 50 dollar bills and mailed it to the boy 's mother . the boy wrote santa again this year , and the letter wound up in john 's in box . he shared a copy and i would like to share it with you . dear santa , thanks so much for all you did last christmas . things are still pretty-rough for us , and my mom sure could use another $ 100 . and , if you do n't mind , santa , when you send it to my mom , please do n't route it through washington . the last time they deducted 50 percent . actually , that is an old j. edward day joke , or so i 've been told , not an edward j. gleiman-joke . i thought it fit both the holiday season and the postal-rate case postmortem .
