new jersey law journal n.j. legal-services consolidated plan panned in passaic mary p. gallagher , monday , october 14 , 2002 the passaic county legal-aid society is suing to block a proposal to reduce new jersey 's 14 legal-services-areas to six , claiming the consolidation is a concerted-effort to defund the passaic-branch . the federal-court-suit , passaic county legal-aid society v. legal-services corp. , 02-cv-3866 , names as defendants the national legal-services corp. , which distributes federal-grants to providers , and legal-services of new jersey , which distributes state-money . passaic-legal aid argues that lsc has effectively debarred it from receiving future-grants without providing the notice and hearing required by law . the passaic-office is refusing to join in that reconfiguration , which goes into effect jan. 1 . deputy director maxim thorne says the plan would threaten innovative-programs that have expanded the range of services offered , and won-awards and broad-community support . lsc and lsnj , on the other hand , say passaic-legal aid voluntarily sacrificed its chance for federal-funding . they say the local-organization seeks special-treatment by being exempted from requirements that apply to all lsc grantees in the country . `` it was passaic 's choice not to be part of the consolidation , '' says lsnj president melville d. miller , jr. none of the state's other legal-services-programs opposes the reconfiguration , adds miller , who is a named defendant in the suit . under the reconfiguration-plan , only essex-newark legal-services would continue to serve a single-county . the rest of the state would be divided into five regions of two to seven counties each . passaic county has been rolled into a northeast service-area that also includes bergen and hudson . at present , 10 providers serve a single-county , three serve two counties and one serves five . the reconfiguration is part of a nationwide-effort by lsc to boost cost-effectiveness by reducing the number of providers through a competitive-bidding-process imposed by congress under a 1996 law . as a result of the process , many states , including maine , connecticut , colorado and washington now have only a single lsc grantee , while illinois and texas have a mere three . bergen and hudson have submitted a joint-bid to serve the bergen-hudson-passaic-area . though passaic submitted its own bid , lsc deemed it nonconforming because it disregarded the reconfiguration and sought to continue serving only passaic county . because it is now too late to submit a proper-bid , passaic will not receive lsc-funding in 2003 . that will leave almost a $ 400,000 hole in its budget of over $ 2 million , estimates passaic executive director john atlas . that is bad but not fatal news . `` if all we lost was the federal-money , we could easily accommodate that , '' says atlas . he and thorne , however , say the loss of federal-funds is the first step in a process that will also cost them about $ 1.5 million in state-funding , which makes up the bulk of their budget . most of the state-funding is iolta-money and state-appropriations funneled through lsnj . and , says atlas , `` lsnj seems to be in lockstep with lsc . '' miller would not say whether passaic 's loss of the lsc-grant would be followed by a cutoff of state-funding , but comments , `` we have only , historically , had one provider in any geographical service-area . '' the consolidation has not cost any staff-jobs but will reduce the number of executive-directors , he adds . 'hostility and antagonism' lsnj originally proposed a state-plan that would leave the passaic-area separate because of its size and problems that made it an undesirable-merger-partner . lsc 's vice-president for programs , randi youells rejected that suggestion and adopted the plan merging-passaic and bergen and hudson . in a letter last march 28 , she said her decision was based on years of unresolved-problems with passaic , combined with its '' hostility and antagonism . '' youells wrote , `` it is highly-unlikely that pclas will ever be in a position to give clients in this service-area the level of service and benefits commensurate with the amount of resources available to them . '' a february 2000 site-visit report on passaic-legal aid by lsc , lsnj and the state-office of legal-services supports that view . it found strengths like a high-caliber , diverse-staff and an active community-education-program that includes a cable-television-show . but these were offset by a poor-intake-system , uneven-supervision , a failure to undertake `` aggressive legal-work '' and `` a disturbing intransigence '' by management to address longstanding-morale and turnover-problems . four former passaic-legal aid lawyers , who requested-anonymity , confirm that those problems drove them and others to leave the program . passaic-legal aid argues that lsc used the consolidation-process to deny funding based on performance without a required-hearing . though passaic-legal aid did meet with lsc president john erlenborn in june , thorne says the meeting was too limited in scope to satisfy due-process . though lsnj recommended keeping the passaic-service-area separate , passaic-legal contends that lsnj is acting as lsc 's agent in defunding the passaic-unit . further , passaic-charges that lsnj is breaching a fiduciary-duty owed to local-programs by competing with them for money to fund its own programs . the passaic-group also accuses youells of retaliating against it for refusing miller 's suggestion to hire her as a consultant in 1998 , an argument miller dismisses as `` preposterous . '' on the policy-side , atlas and thorne contend that the combined hudson-bergen-entity would not be able to take over the community and economic-development-type-services passaic-legal aid has been providing along with the core-litigation-services traditionally offered by legal-aid-providers . they boast of national-recognition for their work in this area , including the american bar-association 's lawyer as problem solver award in august . passaic-legal has been marshalling political and community opposition to the merger . for example , rep. william pascrell jr. , d-nj , wrote to lsc ; the passaic county board of chosen freeholders passed a resolution against it ; and local-mayors , the state and local-bar-associations and various community-groups clients have written letters on behalf of passaic-legal aid . passaic-legal aid also met with assignment judge robert passero to warn that it might soon be forced to pull out of many of its cases . passero says he is pleased with passaic-legal aid 's work in the courts and is concerned because of the differing-demographics of the counties . compared with bergen , passaic has many more people who are poor and spanish-speaking and receive housing-aid and they should not have to travel elsewhere for legal-aid , he says . miller says they will not have to , as no county will lose an office on account of the merger . nor will community-development-help be sacrificed . `` hudson county was one of the first to do that kind of work , though not to the extent that passaic does , '' says hudson legal-aid director tim madden . madden , bergen county director anna navatta and others met with passaic-legal aid representatives in august and discussed the possibility of directing some of the lsc money to passaic as a subgrantee for its community-development-work . bergen and hudson nixed the plan last month . `` we were willing to explore possibilities and maybe even lend assistance , '' says madden . but `` the new entity does not want to have any responsibility for administering a grant . '' what the case comes down to is lsc 's discretion to reconfigure the service-areas in the state , says alan kraus , who represents lsc and youells . a similar legal-challenge in virginia failed , says kraus , a partner with the newark office of latham & watkins , citing o'donnell v. eidleman , no . 00-1901 ( 4th cir.2001 ) . linda harvey , a partner with newark 's greenberg , dauber , epstein & tucker , who represents lsnj and miller , calls passaic-legal aid `` a renegadeâ€¦that is asking the court to buck the national-trend and the wishes of congress . '' robert magnanini , counsel at latham & watkins , worries that a grant of injunctive-relief could hold up lsc-funding for bergen and hudson . but miller says , `` i would be stunned if there was an injunction . legally , i do n't think there 's any ground . no federal judge will block-funding for legal-assistance . '' unless u.s. district judge william walls , who is assigned to the case , calls a halt to the process , lsc expects to make final-grant awards by early december . lsc and lsnj have both moved to dismiss the case . those motions , and passaic-legal aid 's request for relief are scheduled to be heard on october 29 .
