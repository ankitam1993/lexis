executive-summary - the clear skies initiative february 14 , 2002 today , president bush proposed the most significant-step america has ever taken to cut power-plant-emissions , the clear skies initiative . this new proposal will aggressively reduce air-pollution from electricity-generators and improve air-quality throughout the country . the clear skies initiative will cut air-pollution 70 percent , using a proven , market-based-approach that will save american-consumers-millions of dollars . america needs a clean , secure , affordable , reliable-energy-supply in the years ahead . president bush has often said that environmental-protection and energy-production are not competing-priorities . this progressive-plan shows how that objective can be reached . we can meet our environmental-goals while providing affordable-electricity for american-consumers and american businesses . america has made great-progress in reducing-air-pollution . over the last three decades , air-pollution has declined by 29 percent , while our economy has grown nearly 160 percent . these gains have provided cleaner air for millions of people . our understanding of science , technology , and markets has improved since the clean-air act was passed in 1970 . we know more about the best way to reduce pollution , and how to do it cost effectively . the acid-rain-cap and trade-program created by congress in 1990 reduced more pollution in the last decade than all other clean-air act command-and-control-programs combined , and achieved significant-reductions at two-thirds of the cost to accomplish those reductions using a '' command-and-control '' system . it 's time to take the best of what we have learned and modernize the clean-air act . that 's why president bush is proposing a new clean-air act for the 21st century . the clear skies initiative will : dramatically cut power plants ' emissions of three of the worst air-pollutants . � cut-sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) emissions by 73 percent , from current-emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010 , and 3 million tons in 2018 . � cut-emissions of nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) by 67 percent , from current-emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million tons in 2008 , and to 1.7 million tons in 2018 . � cutting-mercury-emissions by 69 percent , -the first-ever national-cap on mercury-emissions . emissions will be cut from current-emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010 , and 15 tons in 2018 . � emission-caps will be set to account for different-air-quality needs in the east and the west . use a new , market-based-approach to clean-air : � protect americans from respiratory and cardiovascular-diseases by dramatically reducing-smog , fine particulate-matter , regional-haze ; and protect wildlife-habitat and ecosystem-health from acid-rain , nitrogen and mercury-deposition . nox and so2 emissions both contribute to fine particulate-matter-emissions and nox also contributes to ground-level-ozone or smog . � save americans as much as $ 1 billion annually in compliance-costs that are passed along to american-consumers , while improving air-quality and protecting the reliability and affordability of electricity for consumers . � cut-pollution further , faster , cheaper - and with more certainty - eliminating the need for expensive and uncertain-litigation as a means of achieving clean-air . � build upon the 1990 clean-air act 's acid-rain-program , america 's most successful clean-air-law in the last decade , and encourage the use of new pollution-control-technologies . president bush has a strong-track-record on enacting far-reaching clean-air-initiatives . in 1999 , then-governor bush signed-legislation that permanently caps nox and so2 emissions from older power plants in texas starting in 2003 . the legislation was widely hailed as a model for the country . the texas program is designed to reduce nox-emissions by 75,000 tons per year , and so2 emissions by 35,000 tons per year , while giving-utilities flexibility in determining how and where to achieve the reductions . this approach enjoys strong , bipartisan-support throughout the country : '' congress should pass legislation to establish a flexible , market-based-program to significantly reduce and cap-emissions of sulfur-dioxide , nitrogen-oxides , mercury and voluntary-reductions of carbon dioxide from electric-power-generators . the legislation should provide regulatory-certainty by establishing-reduction targets for emissions , phasing in reductions over a reasonable-period of time and providing market-based-incentives such as emissions-trading-credits to help achieve the required-reductions . '' �unanimous resolution of the national governors association , august , 2001 . the environmental council of the states approved a resolution in february , 2001 , supporting a cost-effective , efficient and environmentally protective-multi-pollutant-proposal . background � the success of the clean-air act pollution has declined by 29 percent while our economy has grown nearly 160 percent in the u.s. , power plants emit significant-amounts of air-pollution : 67 percent of all sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) emissions , 37 percent of mercury-emissions , and 25 percent of all nitrogen-oxide ( nox ) emissions . these pollutants contribute to a variety of health and environmental-problems , such as smog , acid-rain , nitrogen-deposition and visibility-impairment . current-law addresses each of these pollutants independently , on different-timetables , through several different-programs . these laws are uncoordinated and often-inconsistent . power plants might install equipment one year that is rendered obsolete the next . implementation and enforcement usually requires years of litigation , leaving the fate of america 's air to the uncertainties of the courtroom . after 30 years of experience in regulating-air-pollution , america has proved that there is a better way to accomplish our clean-air-goals . the 1990 clean-air act amendments , proposed and signed into law by president george h.w . bush , have significantly reduced air-pollution , especially through the innovative `` cap-and-trade '' acid-rain control program . the acid-rain-program has been a resounding-success , cutting annual-sulfur-dioxide emissions in the first phase by 50 percent below allowed levels . emissions were reduced faster than required , and at far less cost . industry-compliance has been nearly 100 percent , and the program only requires a handful of epa employees to operate . this approach is vastly more effective , and cheaper - two-thirds cheaper - than the traditional '' command-and-control '' approach . this program is clearly a model for success . president bush wants to expand this program to include two new pollutants - nitrogen-oxides and mercury - while also dramatically reducing the so2 emissions allowed by current-law . the clear skies initiative � building on the clean-air act the president 's clear skies initiative is designed to help us meet our national-air-quality goals . a new clean-air act for the 21st century must build on this founding-principle -modernization and better technology will mean a progressive new way to accomplish these long-standing environmental-goals . the clear skies initiative will continue to bring americans : � improved air-quality : reducing-air-pollution will bring clean-air to tens of millions of people , saving them from smog ( ground-level-ozone ) and fine particulate-matter ( dust ) that cause respiratory and cardiovascular-distress . � improved health : reducing-emissions of fine particulate-matter will prolong thousands of lives and prevent thousands of new cases of chronic-bronchitis , hospitalizations and emergency-room-visits . reducing the formation of ground-level-ozone , or smog , will bring healthier-air to tens of millions of people , and reduce the number of ozone-related-health-problems such as respiratory-infection , asthma-attacks , and chronic-lung-damage . reducing-mercury-emissions will reduce the risk of toxic-effects from mercury-exposure to children exposed during their mother 's pregnancy . � better environmental-protection from acid-rain , smog , haze , mercury and nitrogen-deposition : reducing so2 and nox-emissions will save hundreds of northeastern-lakes and hundreds of thousands of acres of forests from acid-rain , particularly in the adirondacks and other parts of the appalachian mountains . it will also improve visibility over much of the country , particularly the scenic-vistas in national-parks such the grand canyon . reducing-emissions of nitrogen-oxides will also reduce nitrogen-deposition in water , improving coastal-ecosystem-health along the east and gulf coasts . reducing-mercury-emissions will reduce mercury-deposition in lakes and streams . � secure , affordable power : the clear skies initiative will keep electricity-costs low for consumers by saving as much as $ 1 billion each year in compliance-costs . power-generators will have the flexibility to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective way . it will also encourage the continual-improvement in technology to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants in concert with the department of energy 's clean-coal-technology program and incentives for power plants that install `` scrubbers '' early in the program . under the clear skies initiative , america will continue to have a diverse-fuel-mix that ensures a reliable , affordable-energy-supply . how the clear skies initiative works to improve air-quality for millions of americans , the clear skies initiative will adopt the lessons learned from 30 years of environmental-regulation by : 1 . establishing emission-reduction-targets , based on sound science , that will significantly improve air-quality , protecting human and environmental health : by reducing-air-pollution , and conducting constant-monitoring of emissions , the clear skies initiative guarantees that america 's power plants will meet ambitious air-quality-goals , even as they bring new power plants on line to meet growing demand . during the first phase , the epa administrator will review new scientific , technology and cost-information and , if necessary , adjust the phase two targets . this will include a vigorous-research-program to further understand the fate and transport of pollutants in the atmosphere . 2 . adopting a comprehensive , integrated , multi-pollutant approach : by reducing-emissions of the three key-sources of air-pollution at the same time , the clear skies initiative will produce environmental-results more effectively and efficiently than the current-labyrinth of overlapping and uncoordinated-single-pollutant requirements . the current-approach is inefficient and ineffective , imposing unnecessarily high costs due to : ( 1 ) stranded capital-investments from the installation of controls that later become obsolete when additional-requirements are promulgated ; ( 2 ) reduced lead-time for complying with those requirements ; ( 3 ) limited or non-existent-flexibility for emissions-trading to allow cost-efficient-control-options ; and ( 4 ) a reliance upon lengthy , expensive , and uncertain-litigation to sort out regulatory ambiguity and compliance with the law . 3 . improving environmental-performance at lower cost using market-based-mechanisms that create incentives for innovation : using the market-based-mechanism of a cap-and-trade-program , the clear skies initiative will establish national , federally-enforceable emissions-limits for each pollutant . allowances are distributed to electricity-generators , and the cap declines at specific-intervals , 2010 , and then again in 2018 . generators respond by gradually reducing their emissions - reducing more than the cap requires early in the program in order to save allowances for use later in the program when the caps decline . that is , generators respond to declining-allowance-caps just like people respond to declining-income when they 're planning for retirement : they do more now , investing and saving for the future . individual generators can choose when to reduce their emissions in response to their particular-circumstances and the price of allowances they see in the market . this encourages the least expensive-reductions over time as well as across facilities . at this point , the government only has to enforce the emission-limits , distribute allowances and verify that each facility has sufficient-allowances for their annual-emissions . there 's no need for lengthy , costly , uncertain-litigation to enforce the law . creative , innovative-strategies to reduce emissions are immediately rewarded : facilities save money by finding innovative-ways to reduce emissions more than a command-and-control-law would require . this creates an incentive for continual-improvement in environmental-performance . the flexibility in the process of allocating-emission-credits or allowances will also accommodate the different-air-quality needs in the east and the west while preserving fair-competition . western-states have already made significant-headway in identifying-future so2 reductions necessary to meet air-quality-goals in the western regional air partnership ( `` wrap '' ) agreement between epa , western-states , tribes , industry and environmental-groups . so2 allocations will track this agreement . nox reduction-caps for the east and west will also be set to accommodate these different-needs , and separate east and west-trading-regions will be created . 4 . ensuring a secure , affordable-energy-supply : by setting-firm caps while offering-flexibility in how utilities can meet those caps , the clear skies initiative preserves a diverse-fuel-mix that supports economic growth with reasonably priced energy . the firm caps and the adequate-lead-time create a predictable-climate for long-term-planning and capital investment in power-generation , which will ensure an adequate-energy-supply . this will also create substantial-cost-savings to consumers . the cap-and-trade system in the clear skies initiative how does it work ? the clear skies initiative will deliver substantial-health and environmental-benefits through a market-based-approach that rewards innovation , reduces costs , and ensures results . instead of the government telling-electricity-generators precisely where and how to reduce their emissions - the old command-and-control-approach - this market-based-program tells them when and how much to reduce pollution by establishing a firm , maximum `` cap '' on emissions . the trading-program creates incentives for electricity-generators to reduce their emissions even more than the law requires , and more quickly than required . electricity-generators must hold an `` allowance '' for each ton of pollution they emit - one ton , one allowance . the government controls the number of allowances that are distributed and reduces them over time . electricity-generators must continually monitor and report their emissions . most importantly , these allowances can be traded freely . that means that if you 're smart and creative , and you figure out a better way to reduce emissions , you get rewarded by making those reductions and selling unneeded-allowances in the market . and , if you unexpectedly ca n't reduce emissions as much as planned , you have the flexibility to go out and buy more allowances in the market - all without any government-interference , and without undermining-air-quality . this flexibility lets businesses figure out the cheapest way to reduce emissions while government sticks to setting the overall-emission-cap at a level that guarantees that industry meets ambitious air-quality-goals . why does it work ? the cap ensures that the reductions in so2 , nox and mercury required by the clear skies initiative are achieved and maintained over time even as new power plants are built . the open-trading program gives power plants the flexibility to choose how they meet their target-emission-reductions , which minimizes compliance-costs and lowers consumer-electricity-prices . what are the results ? cost-savings - the acid-rain-cap and trade-program passed by congress in 1990 achieved reductions at two-thirds the cost of achieving the same reductions under a command-and-control-system . this program reduced more pollution in the last decade than all other clean-air act command-and-control-programs combined during the same period . innovation - trading under the acid-rain-program created financial-incentives for electricity-generators to look for new and low-cost-ways to reduce emissions and to do so early . integrity -the acid-rain-cap and trade-program has high accountability and transparency . electricity-generators must install monitors to prove that they have sufficient-allowances to match their actual-emissions . regional-effect - the acid-rain-program resulted in emission-reductions well below the cap in the areas that contribute most of the sulfur in acid-rain . comparing-emissions from the 263 power plants regulated in the first phase of the program in 1999 with those in 1990 , the north central , southeast and mid-atlantic regions achieved 49 percent , 48 percent and 43-percent-reductions in so2 respectively . several-analyses of trading under the acid-rain-program have concluded that the program did not result in local-areas with higher emission-levels ( `` hot-spots '' ) . guaranteed-results - the acid-rain-program enjoys nearly 100 percent-compliance and only takes 75 epa employees to run - a track record no command-and-control-program can meet . reductions in the early-years averaged 25 percent below the required cap . emission cuts resulted in air-quality-improvements over a broad-area of the u.s. and significant-reductions in acid-rain . emissions from power plants in the first phase of the acid-rain-program 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 sulfur-dioxide-emissions were far below allowable-levels during phase i . 1980 1985 1990 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 what the experts say about the acid-rain-cap and trade-program '' the data confirm a general-prediction about cap-and-trade-programs , that they will tend to create incentives for the dirtiest plants to clean up the most , as the per-ton-cost of emissions-reductions may be expected to be the least . …the data show that , if anything , trading may be expected to cool hot-spots and not create them .
