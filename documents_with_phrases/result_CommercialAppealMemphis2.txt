justice is not an empty-word legal-services reaches through barrier of poverty to aid clients shirley downing saturday , november 9 , 2002 thelma james was a prime-candidate for a real-estate-ripoff : she is 68 , has precious little-money and ca n't read or write . `` i wo n't lie to you . i was so-o-o-excited , '' the widow and former duplex-dweller said of the purchase of her first home , a sagging frame-structure on snowden . `` i was glad to get me a house . '' when james realized she had been swindled she turned to memphis area legal-services , which represented her in a lawsuit . now , james 's monthly-house-notes have dropped from $ 796 - more than twice her monthly-income - to an affordable $ 247 . some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable-loan program were sent to jail . `` i do n't know what i would have done without legal-services , '' said james . `` they solved a lot of my problems . '' james is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by mals , which provides assistance for civil-matters , such as domestic-abuse and family-related-problems , social-security and supplemental-security-income , veterans , housing and consumer-fraud-cases . like james , most clients are elderly or female . some are handicapped . some need medical care or veteran 's benefits . some are trying to escape eviction or an abusive-marriage . and 87 percent live at or below poverty-level . shelby county mayor a c wharton recently said legal-services is important for those who , because of poverty or other struggles in life , think justice is an empty-word . `` they must be given reason to believe that the law is for them too , '' said wharton , a former-executive-director of mals . but mals faces a funding-crunch next year , brought on by a $ 200,000 shortfall from three revenue-sources . even though more than 150,000 people in shelby , fayette , tipton and lauderdale counties qualify for public legal-aid , the latest census shows a loss of 10,166 poverty-level-clients in the area . the population shift translates into a loss of $ 163,000 by the parent legal-services corp. , combined with the loss of $ 35,000 in court-generated-fees from two other programs . lawyers and judges are trying to raise money for the agency that many say has worked magic with little more than gumption , hardscrabble-dollars and a rambling , second-floor-warren of rooms across the street from city hall . several-law-firms have donated about $ 25,000 and the community foundation of greater memphis recently pledged $ 75,000 over three years . mals was formed here more than 30 years ago . today , 14 staff-attorneys , 26-office-workers and 21 university of memphis third- year-law-students work out of rented offices in the old claridge hotel building at 109 n. main . offices are spartan . there are no lush-rugs or stylish furniture . the large-table in the conference-room is simple varnished-wood . offices are small and mostly-plain , except for the eclectic-mix of pop-art , african-statuary and neon that adorns litigation-director webb brewer 's space . brewer , who has been at the agency 20 years , said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor . `` the private-bar could meet more of the need through pro-bono-work , but there are still cases that involve the systemic-problems for low-income-people that we would need to do , '' said brewer . `` the legal-system-marketplace just does n't serve low-income-people too well , except in fee-generat-ing-type-cases , '' brewer said . `` if a poor-person gets run over by a bus , an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage-award as attorney-fees . but so many of the cases we handle have to do with basic-rights and a decent-life . there is just no profit-motive . '' larry pivnick , law-professor at the university of memphis law-school and director of political-programs at mals , said legal-services is a great learning-laboratory for law-students . `` there are thousands and thousands of people who have problems that never get an opportunity to appear in court , '' pivnick said . `` some people may not be particularly-articulate . courts have rules that clients do n't always understand . '' brewer said a major-focus of the agency 's work involves housing . `` although a lot of our work is grant-driven , we find that the lack of safe and decent affordable-housing and the prevalence of predatory-lending are the biggest problems in our client-population , '' brewer said , referring to clients such as james . james spoke with a reporter during a recent-visit at mals offices . other clients there that day included a 42-year-old woman who needed-help getting child-support-payments from her former lover , a married-preacher who had fathered a child with her during a six-year-affair . down the hall was longtime-community-activist georgia king , 62 , talking to a lawyer about her pending-eviction from a high-rise efficiency-apartment . king said she is accused of having too much clutter . `` i was homeless when i went there , and everything i got , somebody had give to me , '' she said , noting she is trying to sift through things . `` if they had give me a one-bedroom i would have room for everything. `` king has high praise for legal-services . `` they help you in a lot of different-areas , '' she said . dana brandon , 43 , turned to mals for help finding a school and treatment-program for her 9-year-old son after it became clear the child would not fit into any of the city-school-system 's special education-programs . brandon could not hire a private-attorney because she has to stay home to tend her son , who is often-violent and who requires constant-supervision . `` i think they have been very helpful , '' she said . andre turner , an ex-marine , turned to legal-services when he was fired from his job for missing too much-work . turner 's 12-year-old son needs a kidney-transplant and turner said he had to miss work to take him to numerous-doctor and dialysis-visits . when he was fired , turner 's son lost his insurance and his place in line for the transplant . `` i felt like my rights were violated , '' turner said , noting that though the case is still pending , legal-services was able to get the insurance reinstated . the transplant is now closer to reality . the hardest part of losing his job , turner said , was answering his son . `` he still asks me if he is going to die , and if i 'm still going to give him my kidney .
