. introduction legal-services corporation ( lsc ) is a private , non-membership , nonprofit-corporation in the district of columbia . eleven-voting-members , appointed by the president of the united states with the advice and consent of the senate , compose the lsc board of directors . by law , the board is bipartisan : no more than six members can be of the same political party.1 lsc was created by congress in 1974 and continues to play a central-role in providing low-income americans with access to legal-assistance and information concerning critical civil legal-problems . lsc is guided by its congressionally mandated mission , spelled out in the lsc act of 1974 , `` to provide equal-access to the system of justice in our nation for individuals who seek redress of grievances '' and `` to provide high quality legal-assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to afford adequate legal-counsel . `` 2 lsc-funds local legal-services-programs to serve diverse-clientele in every state , county , and congressional-district in the united states , as well as in puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam , and micronesia . as one of the primary funders of civil equal-justice in every state , lsc has a duty to stimulate the most effective-means of delivering legal-services to low-in-come-individuals . lsc is committed to meaningful-partnerships with our grantees and the broader civil equal-justice-community . lsc is also obligated to ensure that the federal-investment promotes efficient and effective-client-service and complements the efforts of other providers of civil legal-services . in 1996 , congress passed a major-overhaul of lsc 's grant-making and regulatory-structure that included three major-reforms impacting the legal-services community.3 first , congress adopted a number of new accountability-requirements governing what services lsc-funded-programs may provide , what they may do with non-lsc-funds , and whom they may represent . these new guidelines have refocused the lsc delivery-system on serving individual-clients with particular legal-needs . attorneys working for lsc-funded-programs may no longer , for example , initiate or participate in class-action-lawsuits , collect courtawarded-attorneys ' fees , represent prisoners or certain-categories of aliens , or take cases involving political-redistricting , abortion , or drug-related public-housing evictions.4 another major-reform of 1996 instituted a competitive-bidding-process for lsc service-contracts , requiring programs to demonstrate-results and progress as a condition of continued federal funding.5 finally , in 1996 congress approved a one-third-reduction in lsc 's annual-appropriation , from $ 400 million to $ 278 million.6 in july 1995 , in anticipation of the funding-cutbacks , lsc initiated the broad-outlines of its `` state-planning-process '' to highlight strategies by which programs could stretch scarce federal-dollars to help ensure that all low-income-clients have an equal-opportunity to receive the most accessible , effective legal-assistance possible . after three years of development in the field , lsc 's state-planning-initiative was formally launched in 1998 . in the ensuing lsc annual-appropriation 198519861987 19881989199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001 fiscal year ii . lsc convenes reconfiguration task-force this document , the lsc special report to congress - state-planning and reconfiguration , was prepared in response to a request made by the u.s. house of representatives during the fy2002 appropriations-process , in which the house appropriations subcommittee on commerce , justice , state , and the judiciary stated : the committee supports lsc 's efforts to streamline its service-area configurations through the state-planning-process . however , the committee has been made aware of concerns that lsc has attempted to impose its own reconfiguration-plans on certain states without clearly articulating-standards for such decisions . in several-instances the corporation rejected-reconfiguration-plans developed and approved by all relevant-stakeholders within a state , and provided no opportunity for the state to appeal that decision . the committee expects lsc to review the state-planning-process and the concerns raised , and report back to the committee by no later than september 4 , 200110 , with a proposal that articulates the reconfiguration-standards and process for states to appeal lsc's decisions . the committee intends that lsc consult with appropriate stakeholders in developing this proposal.11 since implementation of the state-planning-initiative in 1998 , lsc has sought to apply a set of detailed-criteria in making all decisions on whether a given service-area-arrangement is optimally configured to provide high-quality legal-services to the greatest number of eligible low-income-clients . these criteria were created to complement the goals of state-planning and to guide staff in evaluating the efficacy of service-area-plans submitted by recognized-stakeholders in each state . these guidelines were conveyed to lsc-funded-programs through the release of a series of program-letters and other field correspondences.12 furthermore , as of july 19 , 2001 , all recognized-stakeholders have a right to a de novo-review of service-area-decisions by both the lsc vice-president for programs and the lsc president when lsc decisions run contrary to stakeholders ' proposed configuration schemes.13 in response to inquiries from the legal-services-community and members of congress , the lsc board of directors on june 30 , 2001 , established the lsc task-force to study and report on configuration of service-areas . the task-force was charged with reviewing '' existing-policies , standards , and procedures governing-state-planning and for defining-service-areas ; and any revisions to existing-policies , standards , and procedures which the task-force concludes to warrant serious-consideration by lsc . `` 14 co-chaired by two lsc board members , new hampshire supreme court justice john t. broderick and ernestine-watlington , the task-force convened the first of several-meetings on august 21 , 2001 , in washington , d.c . representing the task-force were hulett h. askew and maria luisa mercado of the lsc board ; james head of the national legal-aid & defender association ; melville d. miller , jr. , of legal-services of new jersey ; jonathan ross ofthe american bar-association 's standing-committee on legal-aid and indigent-defendants ; faith rivers of the south carolina bar-association ; and jeanne charn , director of clinical legal-education at harvard law-school . justice broderick delivered an interim-report from the task-force to the lsc board of directors at the board 's meeting on september 8 , 2001 , in alexandria , va. broderick reported that the task-force has made considerable-progress in examining-concerns pertinent to service-area-configuration and the right of designated stakeholders to appeal decisions with which they disagree . he stated that broad-consensus exists on a majority of issues before the task-force and that remaining-areas of disagreement are expected to be resolved in short-order . one specific-area of consensus among task-force members was that all lsc reconfiguration criteria should be codified into one document . the current lsc reconfiguration-standards , which are under review by the task-force , are compiled and discussed in section iv of this special report to congress . a final-report from the task-force is expected to be presented to the lsc board of directors for consideration in october 2001 . the lsc board will give due-consideration to any and all recommendations embodied in the task-force 's final-report . in the interim , the board believes it crucial to relay to congress lsc's current-standards governing-state-planning , service-area-configuration , and review-processes . in this report , the lsc board of directors is pleased to provide information addressing congress 's three principal-concerns : 1 . a review of the state-planning-process ; 2 . a report on lsc 's reconfiguration-standards ; and 3 . the process to appeal lsc 's reconfiguration-decisions . iii . an overview of the state-planning-process lsc 's state-planning-initiative embraces a new vision15 for legal-services in which eligible-clients in every state would be afforded an equal-opportunity to avail themselves of high-quality civil legal-assistance . in an effort to foster more consistent-levels of state wide-service and to eliminate `` service-gaps '' that leave cli ents in geographically remote-areas under-represented-com pared to their urban-counterparts , lsc has asked its grant ees to undergo a fundamental-paradigm-shift in their pro gram-visions . program-leaders have been instructed to aban don the parochial-thinking of `` what 's best for clients in my service-area ? '' and asked instead to consider `` what 's best for clients throughout my state ? '' lsc initially stressed the importance of state-plan ning in 1995 when it asked its recipients in each state to participate in the development of plans for the design , con figuration , and operation of lsc-funded-programs in their states . the 1995 program letters16 containing this directive also enumerated the issues and criteria that state-planning should address . launching the state-planning-initiative , lsc staff developed and issued program-letters 1998-117 and 199818 which directed-programs to plan for the creation of comprehensive , integrated , client-centered legal-services-systems and defined the terms of such systems . grantees were required to submit reports outlining their state-plans by october 1 , 1998 . their plans were to include responses to the seven central-tenets of state-planning : ( 1 ) development of intake , advice , and referral-services ; ( 2 ) effective-usage of technology ; ( 3 ) increased-access to legal self-help and prevention-information ; ( 4 ) coordination of legal-work , training , information , and ex pert-assistance ; ( 5 ) engagement of pro-bono attorneys ; ( 6 ) development of additional-state , local , and private-resources ; and ( 7 ) optimal-configuration of service-areas . in designing-state-plans , lsc instructed its programs to collaborate with a range of local , state , and national-stakeholders , including-state and local-bar-associations , interest on lawyers trust-account ( iolta ) administrators , state-judiciaries , client-groups , pro-bono commissions , state-legislatures , non-lsc-funded legal-services-programs , and a host of others . lsc requires its grantees in each state to work with each other and equal-justice-stakeholders to develop justice-communities that best respond to clients ' most compelling-needs , ensure the most strategic and cost-effective-use of all available-resources , and maximize the opportunity for clients statewide to receive timely , effective , and appropriate legal-services . guided by the belief that access to quality legal-services is critical to a fair adversarial-justice-system and committed to making significant-improvements in their delivery , the lsc board of directors approved and enacted strategic-directions 2000-2005 in january 2000 . its twin-objectives are to dramatically increase the number of low-income americans who can access the civil-justice-system and to ensure that all clients receive quality legal-services . iv . report on lsc 's reconfiguration-standards congress has vested in legal-services corporation the responsibility of specifying the service-areas for which it will offer-grants for the provision of legal-services . lsc awards one service-contract per delineated-service-area . some states , like california and new jersey , comprise multiple-service-areas and , therefore , feature multiple-lsc-funded grantees . others , like indiana and colorado , have one service-area encompassing the entire-state and one corresponding statewide-program . each state is different , and in some states , intra-state-regions differ significantly as well . as lsc has stated in numerous-letters to the field , there is no `` magic-number '' of legal-services-programs for a given state or a single-delivery-model that fits every state . each state-plan must be viewed based on the totality of the circumstances , with the bottom-line-consideration turning on lsc's studied determination as to whether a given service-area-configuration inures to the benefit of the greatest number of clients in the most cost-effective way . as a general-rule , service-area-configuration decisions are evaluated against one overarching-principle : program-configuration should occur in a manner that maximizes the effective and efficient-delivery of high quality legal-services to eligible-clients throughout the state within a comprehensive , integrated-delivery-system . in some states , it may be possible to develop and implement statewide-initiatives to improve service-delivery , increase resources , and enhance the capacity of the system to meet the civil legal-needs of all low-income-people without altering-service-areas or historical-relationships . in other states , the very development and implementation of such initiatives may require overhauling or establishing new organizational-relationships and service-areas . in the vast majority of cases , lsc has agreed with the recommendations of state-planning-groups throughout the country and has configured service-areas accordingly . however , lsc , in the proper-exercise of its statutory-authority , may sometimes reject a state-plan as insufficiently-responsive to the tenets of state-planning and substitute a reconfiguration-plan adjudged to better maximize effective and efficient-delivery of high quality legal-services . in deciding to accept or reject a proposed state-plan , lsc must ultimately determine whether , when taken together with strategies outlined in the plan in question , the proposed configuration is best calibrated to : until the implementation of the state-planning-initiative , determining-service-areas in a given state was more a product of geographic and historical-happenstance than a reasoned judgment about the precise-configuration that would yield the best legal-services-system for the greatest number of clients . but congress' 1996 reform replacing presumptive-refunding of grantees with competitive-bidding for lsc service-contracts19 - coupled with budget-cuts of the same year - necessitated a thoroughreexamination of the efficacy of existing-service-area arrangements in each state . with fewer resources to expend and a growing-client-base to serve , lsc has embraced service-area reconfiguration as one important way to `` insure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective-delivery of legal-assistance to persons in both urban and rural areas . `` 20 rather than viewing service-area reconfiguration as a punitive-measure against under-performing-programs currently receiving federal-funds , lsc instead considers statewide reconfiguration to be one of several-tools to ensure that federal-dollars are being spent in the most efficient , cost-effective-manner possible , in a way that will result in the best service to the most low-income-clients . 11 v. reconfiguration review-process on july 19 , 2001 , lsc implemented a reconfiguration re view-process establishing an official-framework by which designated state-planning bodies21 may seek review of lsc reconfiguration-decisions . this formal-review process guarantees representatives of every designated state-planning-body the right to direct communication with lsc officials at the highest level in seeking-reconsideration of an lsc decision . the objective of the review-process is to maximize the potential for full-communication between stakeholders and lsc officials before any configuration-decisions are made final and effective . central to the review-process is the right of designated stakeholders to de novo-reviews of all configuration-decisions , first by the lsc vice-president for programs and then by the lsc president , whose decision is final and binding . the review-process guarantees dspb representatives a face-to-face-meeting with the vice-president of programs to make their case . if the state-planning-body disagrees with the vice-president 's decision , they may then request a face-to-face-meeting with the lsc president to seek reconsideration of the vice-president 's recommendation . after due-consideration of the stakeholders ' ultimate-appeal , the lsc president will promptly advise the state-planning-body of a final decision on configuration . lsc is committed to effective-communication and coordination with designated state-planning-bodies ( dspb ) on matters in which decisions are likely to have a direct-impact on other civil equal-justice-planning initiatives in a state . lsc recognizes the increasingly active-role that state-planners have assumed in overseeing-state civil equal-justice-delivery activities . lsc further recognizes that its decisions have the potential to directly affect state-funding , resource-allocation , and other considerations . in recognition of this crucial-symbiosis , lsc's reconfiguration review-process prescribes a clear-review-mechanism that guarantees recognized-stakeholders a full-opportunity to make their case : 1 ) at the earliest possible-time , lsc 's state-planning-team will advise the dspb in each state of any issues of concern with respect to service-area-configuration and provide guidance on how to address those concerns consistent with the enumerated-reconfiguration-standards . 2 ) to the extent reasonably-practical , lsc 's state-planning-team will work with the dspb , grantees , and other stakeholders to foster timely and effective-consideration of issues relating to service-area reconfiguration . 3 ) lsc will identify in which states , if any , it proposes to define new service-areas at least sixty ( 60 ) days prior to publishing those service-areas in the federal register . at that time , lsc also will notify the relevant-state planning-bodies of pending service-area changes . 4 ) if the lsc state-planning-team recommends a service-area-configuration that differs from that proposed by the dspb , authorized-representatives of the dspb may seek a meeting with lsc 's vice-president for programs to ask for reconsideration . the representatives will be asked to articulate in writing their concerns and objections . 5 ) upon such a request , the vp for programs will convene a face-to-face-meeting with the authorized-representatives of the dspb . as soon as practical thereafter , the vp for programs shall advise the dspb of the service-area-configuration recommendation to be forwarded to the lsc president . in making the recommendation , the vp for programs shall be guided by state planners' responsiveness to the enumerated-reconfiguration-standards ; the analysis and recommendations of the lsc state-planning-team ; the articulated-concerns of the dspb ; and any other information deemed to be relevant by the vp of programs . 6 ) if the dspb is not satisfied with the vp for programs' recommendation , it may seek a meeting with the lsc president to ask for reconsideration . the dspb will be asked to provide any additional written-information it wishes to be considered to assist the lsc president in fully and fairly-entertaining all concerns and objections . 7 ) upon such a request , the president will convene a face-to-face-meeting with the authorized-representatives of the dspb . as soon as practical thereafter , the lsc president will advise the dspb of the final decision on service-area-configuration in the affected-state or territory . in making the decision , the president shall be guided by state-planners ' responsiveness to enumerated-reconfiguration-standards ; the analyses and recommendations of the lsc state-planning-team and the vp for programs ; the articulated-concerns of the dspb ; and any other information deemed relevant by the president . vi . conclusion congressional-reforms passed in 1996 necessitated a fundamental shift in how lsc apportions federal-dollars to legal-services-providers across the country . the shift to a competitive-bidding-process , coupled with sizeable-reductions in legal-services corporation 's annual-budget , compelled the lsc board of directors to adopt a new approach to allocating congress ' annual-investment in civil equal-justice for the poor . the expectations underlying this new approach have been spelled out in considerable-detail in program-letters issued broadly to the field , and in state-by-state correspondences between lsc 's state-planning-team and various equal-justice-stakeholders . in the current-climate of scarce-resources , lsc must remain committed to pursuing bold new approaches that foster effective legal-assistance to low-income-clients , including overhauling service-areas adjudged to be insufficiently-responsive to the tenets of state-planning . in an overwhelming-majority of instances , lsc has used the competitive-bidding-process to forge deeper bonds with its grantees and stakeholders , allowing lsc to serve as an active-partner in planting the seeds of comprehensive , integrated state-justice-communities nationwide . in fact , stakeholders in dozens of states have embraced the new approach fully and reported back enthusiastically on their progress since initiating their own state-planning-processes . lsc understands that organizations can be reluctant to embrace major-change . lsc also recognizes that opinions may differ as to the most appropriate-configuration of service-areas , and that grantees and other stakeholders may have a better perspective on how to best serve clients and enhance access in their states . in recognition of these tensions , lsc has worked diligently since 1995 to convey the expectations of the state-planning-initiative and to establish meaningful-partnerships with stakeholders aimed at fostering a new symbiosis between the federal-provider and recipients of legal-services-funding . however , if an impasse is ultimately reached in a particular-state , it is critical that lsc maintain its statutory-right to decide the configuration of service-areas in order to foster greater access and service for all eligible low-income-clients . endnotes 1

( 2001 ) . 12 the reconfiguration-standards spelled out in this special report to congress consolidate informa- tion taken from the following previously published lsc sources : building-state-justice communi- ties : a state-planning report from the legal-services corporation , april 2001 ; letter to nlada , clasp , and pag , may 1999 ; program-letter 98-1 ; program-letter 98-6 ; program-letter 2000-1 ; and program-letter 2001-7 . additionally , lsc 's state-planning-team has issued numerous other targeted-field correspondences to individual states' stakeholders who have submitted configuration-plans adjudged insufficiently-responsive to the tenets of state-planning . 13 on july 19 , 2001 , prior to congress ' request for this report , lsc issued program-letter 01-4 ( lsc 's reconfiguration review-process ) , which implemented a review-mechanism by which designated state-planning-bodies may appeal lsc reconfiguration-decisions . 14 lsc resolution # 2001-008 , `` resolution establishing a task-force to study and report on configuration of service-areas , '' june 30 , 2001 . 15 twenty-seven-years ago , our government made a pledge to help ensure that all persons have access to america 's civil-justice-system by enacting-legislation that created legal-services corporation . lsc has helped millions of low-income-citizens solve important , sometimes-life-threatening , civil legal-problems . despite the success of lsc and its many contributions to access to justice for low-income americans , its achievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in our society continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain access to our system of justice . until all members of our society are afforded that access , this promise of our government will continue to be unfulfilled . lsc is committed to promoting a new vision of legal-services that will achieve the goal of bringing legal-services to those currently denied-access to the justice-system . 16 program-letter 1995-1 directed lsc-recipients to develop plans to stretch scarce federal-dollars in the most effective , efficient-ways possible . the letter also anticipated the passage of congressional-restrictions on the activities of lsc-programs , prompting lsc to instruct its programs to forge deeper bonds with other stakeholders , including non-lsc-funded-programs , state and local-bar-associations , iolta administrators , the judiciary , and client-groups . program-letter 1995-4 provided a general-outline as to the issues and criteria that the state-planning-process should address . significant-emphasis was placed on the integration of lsc-funded-programs into statewide-legal services-delivery-systems and the seven central-tenets of state-planning were identified . 17 program-letter 1998-1 , published on february 12 , 1998 , called upon all lsc-recipients to analyze any progress made toward the development of the legal-services-model envisioned by state-planners . programs were to evaluate whether all programs were working cohesively to assure that urgent-clients-needs were being addressed ; whether sufficient-capacities for training and information-sharing existed ; whether programs were moving forward on technology ; and whether they were collaborating to increase resources and develop new initiatives to expand the scope of their services . grantees were also asked to examine whether the existing-program-configuration was conducive to the most effective-state delivery-system . grantees were asked to examine their progress in each of the seven principal-areas of state-planning in a manner that included assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current-approach , establishing-goals to strengthen and expand services to eligible-clients , and determining the major-steps yet to be taken and a timetable necessary to achieve those goals . lsc set a deadline of october 1 , 1998 , for submission of state-planning-reports . 18 program-letter 1998-6 , published on july 6 , 1998 , responded to recipient-requests for guidance and additional information on what was expected in their state-planning-reports . it included `` state-planning considerations '' designed to address requests for additional information regarding statewide-goals , capacities , and approaches-recipients should consider in their state-planning-processes . program-letter 1998-6 stated that the state-planning-initiative will provide information to aid lsc in exercising its statutory-responsibility to `` insure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective-delivery of legal-assistance to persons in both urban and rural areas . '' 19 as part of the competitive-bidding requirement , congress mandated that current and past lsc-recipients may not `` be given any preference in the competitive-selection process .
