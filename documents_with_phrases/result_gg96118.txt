united states general-accounting-office comptroller general of the united states gao june 1996 executive-guide effectively implementing the government-performance and results act g ao years 1921 - 1996 preface in recent years , an understanding has emerged that the federal government needs to be run in a more businesslike-manner than in the past . as companies are accountable to shareholders , the federal government is accountable to taxpayers , and taxpayers are demanding as never before that the dollars they invest in their government be managed and spent responsibly . as countless-studies by gao have long noted , federal-agencies often fail to appropriately manage their finances , identify clearly what they intend to accomplish , or get the job done effectively and with a minimum of waste . after decades of seeing these problems recur in agency after agency , congress moved to address this endemic-situation on a governmentwide-basis . major-statutes now in their first years of implementation hold substantial-promise for creating a more accountable and effective federal government . the chief financial-officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 provided for chief financial-officer-positions in 24 major-agencies and required annual-reports on the financial condition of government-entities and the status of management-controls . under the cfo act , federal-agencies will be subject to the same kinds of financial-reporting that have long been required in the private sector and by state and local governments . the information-technology-management reform act of 1996 requires , among other things , that agencies set-goals , measure-performance , and report on progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations through the use of information technology . and , most fundamentally , under the government-performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) , every major federal-agency must now ask itself some basic-questions : what is our mission ? what are our goals and how will we achieve them ? how can we measure our performance ? how will we use that information to make improvements ? gpra forces a shift in the focus of federal-agencies-away from such traditional-concerns as staffing and activity-levels and toward a single overriding-issue : results . gpra requires agencies to set-goals , measure-performance , and report on their accomplishments . this will not be an easy-transition , nor will it be quick . and for some agencies , gpra will be difficult to apply . but gpra has the potential for adding greatly to government-performance-a particularly vital-goal at a time when resources are limited and public-demands are high . to help page 1 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act congress and federal-managers put gpra into effect , we have identified key-steps that agencies need to take toward its implementation , along with a set of practices that can help make that implementation a success . we learned of these practices from organizations that successfully have taken initiatives similar to the ones required by the act . several federal-agencies that have already put these practices to use are represented in the case-illustrations that are part of this guide . this guide is a companion to our executive-guide : improving mission-performance through strategic-information-management and technology , which outlined a number of information-management-approaches that federal-agencies can take to improve their overall-performance . improving the management of federal-agencies will require responsible-actions in several-areas at once . success will demand concerted-effort and long-term-commitment , but the returns should be considerable . and american-taxpayers deserve no less for their investment . charles a. bowsher comptroller general of the united states contents preface 6 introduction page 4 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act abbreviations introduction a changing environment demands federal-management reform over the past several years , congress has taken steps to fundamentally change the way federal-agencies go about their work . congress took these steps in response to management-problems so common among federal-agencies that they demanded-governmentwide solutions . in addition , two contemporary-forces converged to spur congressional-action : year-in , year-out-budget-deficits that had to be brought down and a public now demanding not only that federal-agencies do their jobs more effectively , but that they do so with fewer people and at lower cost . this was-and-remains-an enormous-challenge . for one thing , many of the largest federal-agencies find themselves encumbered with structures and processes rooted in the past , aimed at the demands of earlier times , and designed before modern-information and communications-technology came into being . these agencies are poorly positioned to meet the demands of the 1990s.1 moreover , many of these agencies find themselves without a clear-understanding of who they are or where they are headed . over the years , as new social or economic-problems emerged , congress assigned many agencies new and unanticipated-program-responsibilities . these additions may have made sense when they were made , but their cumulative-effect has been to create a government in which many agencies can not say just what business they are in . in some cases , agencies ' legislative-mandates have grown so muddled that congress , the executive-branch , and other agency stakeholders and customers can not agree on program-goals , worthwhile-strategies , or appropriate-measures of success . our work has shown that the effectiveness of federal-program-areas as diverse as employment-assistance and training , rural-development , early-childhood-development , and food-safety has been plagued by fragmented or overlapping efforts.2 a frequently cited-example of overlap and ineffectiveness is the federal food-safety system , which took-shape under as many as 35 laws and was administered by 12 different-agencies yet had not effectively protected the public from major foodborne illnesses.3 traditionally , federal-agencies have used the amount of money directed toward their programs , or the level of staff deployed , or even the number of tasks completed as some of the measures of their performance . but at a 1improving government : need to reexamine organization and performance ( gao/t-ggd-93-9 , mar . 11 , 1993 ) . 2government-reorganization : issues and principles ( gao/t-ggd/aimd-95-166 , may 17 , 1995 ) . 3food safety : a unified , risk-based safety system needed to enhance food-safety ( gao/t-rced-94-71 , nov. 4 , 1993 ) . legislative-requirements support managing for results time when the value of many federal-programs is undergoing intense public-scrutiny , an agency that reports only these measures has not answered the defining-question of whether these programs have produced real-results . today 's environment is results-oriented . congress , the executive-branch , and the public are beginning to hold agencies accountable less for inputs and outputs than for outcomes , by which is meant the results of government-programs as measured by the differences they make , for example , in the economy or program-participants ' lives . a federal-employment training-program can report on the number of participants . that number is an output . or it can report on the changes in the real-wages of its graduates . that number is an outcome . the difference between the two measures is the key to understanding-government-performance in a results-oriented environment . congress ' determination to make agencies accountable for their performance lay at the heart of two landmark-reforms of the 1990s : the chief financial-officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and the government-performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) . with these two laws , congress imposed on federal-agencies a new and more businesslike framework for management and accountability . in addition , gpra created requirements for agencies to generate the information congressional and executive-branch-decisionmakers need in considering-measures to improve government-performance and reduce costs . the cfo act was designed to remedy decades of serious-neglect in federal financial-management-operations and reporting . it provided for chief financial-officers in the 24 largest federal-departments and agencies , which together account for about 98 percent of the government 's gross-budget-authority . in 1994 , congress followed up on the cfo act with the government-management reform act of 1994 . the latter extended to all 24 cfo act agencies the requirement , beginning with fiscal year 1996 , to prepare and have audited financial statements for their entire-operations . while the cfo act established the foundation for improving management and financial-accountability among the agencies , gpra is aimed more directly at improving their program-performance . gpra requires first that agencies consult with congress and other stakeholders to clearly define their missions . it requires that they establish long-term strategic-goals , as well as annual-goals that are linked to them . they must then measure their performance against the goals they have set and report publicly on how page 7 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act experiences of leading-organizations show a way well they are doing.4 federal-agencies also are to apply these principles-goal-setting , performance-measurement , and reporting-to their information-technology-efforts , under the information-technology-management reform act of 1996 . for example , agencies are to establish performance-measures to gauge how well their information technology supports their program-efforts . at the request of congress , we studied a number of leading-public sector-organizations that were successfully pursuing management-reform-initiatives and becoming more results-oriented.5 we studied-state-governments , such as florida , oregon , minnesota , north carolina , texas , and virginia ; and foreign-governments , such as australia , canada , new zealand , and the united kingdom . many of these organizations found themselves in an environment similar to the one confronting federal-managers-today-one in which they were called upon to improve performance while simultaneously reducing-costs . congress asked whether the experiences of these organizations could yield worthwhile-lessons for federal-agencies as they attempt to implement gpra . each of the organizations we studied set its agenda for management-reform according to its own environment , needs , and capabilities . yet despite their differing-approaches to reform , all these organizations were seeking to become more result-oriented , and they commonly took three key-steps . these were to ( 1 ) define clear-missions and desired-outcomes , ( 2 ) measure-performance to gauge progress , and ( 3 ) use performanceinformation as a basis for decisionmaking . although the organizations we studied were not acting under gpra , their three key-steps were consistent with gpra 's requirements . that is , the first step-define-mission and desired outcomes-corresponds to the requirement in gpra for federal-agencies to develop strategic-plans containing-mission-statements and outcome-related strategic-goals ; the second step-measure performance-corresponds to the gpra requirement for federal-agencies to develop annual-performance-plans with annual-performance-goals and indicators to measure-performance ; and the third step-use-performance 4for a more detailed-description of gpra 's requirements , see appendix i . 5see , for example , transforming the civil-service : building the workforce of the future , results of a gao-sponsored-symposium ( gao/ggd-96-35 , dec. 26 , 1995 ) ; managing for results : experiences abroad suggest insights for federal-management reform ( gao/ggd-95-120 , may 2 , 1995 ) ; managing for results : state experiences provide insights for federal-management reforms ( gao/ggd-95-22 , dec. 21 , 1994 ) ; government-reform : goal-setting and performance ( gao/aimd/ggd-95-130r , mar . 27 , 1995 ) ; executive-guide : improving mission-performance through strategic-information-management and technology ( gao/aimd-94-115 , may 1994 ) . also see our reports and testimonies included as footnotes and the related gao products section of this guide . page 8 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act information-although much broader , includes the requirement in gpra for federal-agencies to prepare annual-performance-reports with information on the extent to which the agency has met its annual-performance-goals . along with each step , certain-practices proved especially-important to the success of their efforts . in addition to these steps , these organizations also found that certain top-leadership practices were central to making the changes needed for the organizations to become more results-oriented . taken together , the key-steps and practices drawn from the organizations we studied provide a useful-framework for federal-agencies working to implement gpra . the key-steps and practices are shown in figure 1 . in this executive-guide , we discuss the three key-steps and their relationship to gpra , along with the practices associated with each step.6 in the final-section of this executive-guide , we discuss the role of top-leadership and the practices it can follow if it hopes to make gpra a driving-force in an organization . accompanying the discussion of each practice is a case-illustration involving a federal-agency that has made progress in incorporating the practice into its operations . the fact that an organization is profiled for a particular-practice is not meant to imply success or lack of success in other dimensions . moreover , underscoring the fact that implementing-management-changes required by gpra will not come quickly , most of the agencies profiled began their results-oriented-management before gpra was enacted . the experiences of leading-organizations suggest that the successful-implementation of gpra may be as difficult as it is important . for example , obtaining-agreement among often competing stakeholders is never easy , particularly in an environment where available-resources are declining . in addition , measuring the federal-contribution to outcomes that require the coordinated effort of numerous public and private-entities-such as improvements in education , employment , or health-can require sophisticated and costly-program-evaluations . to help ensure the success of gpra , the cfo council , which the cfo act created to provide the leadership-foundation necessary to effectively carry out the chief financial officers' responsibilities , established a gpra-implementation-committee . the committee is providing-guidance and information to chief financial-officers and managers in the 24 agencies covered by the cfo act . the committee recognized that uncertainty or fear of failure may immobilize an agency 's efforts to implement gpra and that its implementation is evolutionary in that proficiency comes with time and experience . to assist federal-managers , the committee published guiding-principles and key-issues for implementing gpra.7 our guide is intended to complement the committee 's work in assisting managers as they implement gpra . our work has shown that although the steps and practices discussed in this guide do n't come quickly or easily , they can serve as the fundamental-building-blocks to creating a results-oriented-organization . 6for a detailed-discussion of our objectives , scope , and methodology , see appendix ii . 7implementation of the government-performance and results act ( gpra ) , a report on the chief financial officer 's role and other issues critical to the governmentwide success of gpra , chief financial-officers council , gpra-implementation-committee , may 1995 . gpra requires that federal-agencies , no later than september 30 , 1997 , develop strategic-plans covering a period of at least 5 years and submit them to congress and the office of management and budget ( omb ) . omb provided-guidance on the preparation and submission of strategic-plans as a new part of its circular no . a-11-the basic instructions for preparing the president 's budget-to underscore the essential-link between gpra and the budget-process . omb required agencies to submit major-parts of their strategic-plans by june 7 , 1996 . strategic-plans are intended to be the starting point for each agency 's performance-measurement-efforts . each plan must include a comprehensive-mission-statement based on the agency 's statutory-requirements , a set of outcome-related strategic-goals , and a description of how the agency intends to achieve these goals . the mission-statement brings the agency into focus . it explains why the agency exists , tells what it does , and describes how it does it . the strategic-goals that follow are an outgrowth of this clearly stated-mission . the strategic-goals explain the purposes of the agency 's programs and the results they are intended to achieve . in crafting gpra , congress recognized that federal-agencies do not exist in a vacuum . as agencies develop their mission-statements and establish their strategic-goals , they are required by the act to consult with both congress and their other stakeholders . further , agencies must be alert to the environment in which they operate ; in their strategic-plans , they are required to identify the external-factors that could affect their ability to accomplish what they set out to do . we found that leading-results-oriented organizations consistently strive to ensure that their day-to-day-activities support their organizational-missions and move them closer to accomplishing their strategic-goals . in practice , these organizations see the production of a strategic-plan-that is , a particular-document issued on a particular day-as one of the least important-parts of the planning-process . this is because they believe strategic-planning is not a static or occasional-event . it is , instead , a dynamic and inclusive-process . if done well , strategic-planning is continuous and provides the basis for everything the organization does each day . for strategic-planning to have this sort of impact , three practices appear to be critical . organizations must ( 1 ) involve their stakeholders ; ( 2 ) assess their internal and external-environments ; and ( 3 ) align their activities , core-processes , and resources to support mission-related-outcomes . page 13 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act practice 1 : involve stakeholders successful-organizations we studied based their strategic-planning , to a large-extent , on the interests and expectations of their stakeholders . these organizations recognize that stakeholders will have a lot to say in determining whether their programs succeed or fail . among the stakeholders of federal-agencies are congress and the administration , state and local governments , third-party-service-providers , interest-groups , agency-employees , and , of course , the american-public . in the federal government , stakeholder-involvement is particularly-important as federal-agencies face a complex political environment in which legislative-mandates are often-ambiguous . thus , the basic-questions that must be answered in crafting a mission-statement-what is our purpose , what products and services must we deliver to meet that purpose , and how will that be done-will present a significant-challenge for many agencies . while statutory-requirements are to be the starting point for agency-mission statements , congress , the executive-branch , and other interested parties may all disagree strongly about a given agency's mission and goals . gpra seeks to address such situations by requiring-agencies to consult with congress and other stakeholders to clarify their missions and reach agreement on their goals . full agreement among stakeholders on all aspects of an agency 's efforts is relatively-uncommon because stakeholders ' interests can differ often and significantly . still , stakeholder-involvement is important to help agencies ensure that their efforts and resources are targeted at the highest priorities . just as important , involving-stakeholders in strategic-planning-efforts can help create a basic-understanding among the stakeholders of the competing-demands that confront most agencies , the limited-resources available to them , and how those demands and resources require careful and continuous-balancing . because of its power to create and fund-programs , the involvement of congress is indispensable to defining each agency 's mission and establishing its goals.8 this may entail identifying legislative-changes that are needed to clarify or modify congress ' intent and expectations or to address differing-conditions and citizens ' needs that have occurred since the initial statutory-requirements were established . congressional-consultations also may include additional-guidance on congress ' priorities in those frequent-cases where agencies have more than one statutory-mission . 8managing for results : achieving gpra 's objectives requires strong congressional-role ( gao/t-ggd-96-79 , mar . 6 , 1996 ) . case-illustration : environmental-protection agency involving-customers is important as well . an agency 's customers are the individuals or organizations that are served by its programs . this is not to say that contact between a federal-agency and its customers is always-direct . many federally mandated or federally funded services are dispensed through third parties , such as state-agencies , banks , or medical-insurance-providers . in such cases , federal-agencies face the particularly-challenging task of balancing the needs of customers , service providers , and other stakeholders , who at times may have differing or even competing-goals . in our reviews of successful-results-oriented organizations , we found numerous-examples of organizations that achieved positive results by involving-customers and other stakeholders in defining their missions and desired outcomes.9 oregon , for one , developed consensus on its statewide strategic-plan by bringing together such diverse-stakeholders as legislators , state-agency-officials , county and local-government-officials , and community-group representatives . the minnesota trade office , for another , used-surveys to obtain its stakeholders ' views on the degree to which the office was contributing to its customers ' export-activities . on the basis-of-the data it obtained , the trade office made program-changes and improved both its performance and its responsiveness . the environmental-protection agency ( epa ) was established in 1970 under a presidential-reorganization-plan in response to public concerns over unhealthy-air , polluted-rivers , unsafe-drinking water , and haphazard-waste-disposal . congress gave epa responsibility for implementing federal environmental-laws . from the start , however , epa lacked an overarching legislative-mission , and its environmental-responsibilities have yet to be integrated with one another . as a result , epa could not ensure that it was directing its efforts toward the environmental-problems that were of greatest concern to citizens or posed the greatest risk to the health of the population or the environment itself . therefore , epa decided in 1992 to launch the national environmental-goals project , a long-range-planning-initiative under which it would involve its stakeholders in developing measurable-goals for epa to pursue in improving the quality of the nation 's environment . epa designed its national environmental-goals project to produce a set of long-range environmental-goals , including-milestones to be achieved by 2005 . the agency recognized that while environmental-goals should be 9gao/ggd-95-22 , dec. 21 , 1994 . practice 2 : assess the environment grounded in science and factual-analysis , they should be based , as well , on the needs and expectations of the nation 's citizens . in 1994 , epa initiated a series of nine public-meetings to hear their views . the meetings were held around the country and included environmental-organizations , businesses , state and local governments , tribal-governments , and other stakeholders . to provide a basis for discussion , epa drafted and distributed to participants a set of goal-statements and descriptive-information on the 13 broad environmental-goal-areas that its staff considered to be of the greatest national-importance . epa used the information it received at these public-meetings to revise and better define these goals . for example , the agency added milestones for managing and cleaning up radioactive-waste , restoring contaminated sites to productive-use , and slowing-habitat losses . further , it added the goal of improving its dissemination of environmental-information and its other education-efforts . epa found that its stakeholders ' interests included how epa does its core-processes-for-example , the amount of flexibility it can offer to the regulated-community . epa recognized these stakeholder interests in a summary-report of its revised goals that it sent to congress and its other stakeholders in february 1995 . epa continued to involve stakeholders in the national environmental-goals project by soliciting-comments on the summary-report . many of epa 's stakeholders are businesses or other regulated-entities that wanted the agency to address such matters as the procedural-costs of environmental-regulations . epa responded with a discussion of the overall-costs and benefits of controlling pollution . at its stakeholders ' request , it provided-trend-data and laid out strategies for achieving its environmental-milestones . epa recognizes that involving-stakeholders is an ongoing-effort that needs to be continued . the proposed goals are to be sent again to federal , state , local , and tribal-government-stakeholders for another round of review later this year , and plans are being made for public-review . good-managers have understood for a long time that many forces-both inside and outside their organizations-can-influence their ability to achieve their goals . but even managers who try to stay alert to these forces often gather their information anecdotally or informally . in contrast , the successful-organizations we studied monitor their internal and external-environments continuously and systematically . organizations that do this have shown an ability to anticipate future-challenges and to make case-illustration : united states customs service-adjustments so that potential-problems do not become crises.10 by building environmental-assessment into the strategic-planning-process , they are able to stay focused on their long-term-goals even as they make changes in the way they intend to achieve them . both the external and internal-environments are important , and neither can be viewed independently of the other . assessing the external-environment is particularly-important , in part because so many external-forces that fall beyond an organization 's influence can powerfully affect its chances for success . for organizations both public and private , external-forces can include newly emerging economic , social , and technological-trends and new statutory , regulatory , and judicial-requirements . an organization 's internal-forces include its culture , its management-practices , and its business-processes . today , federal-agencies find that monitoring these internal-forces is especially-important , given the effects of funding-reductions and reorganizations . the tools available to organizations assessing the internal-environment include program-evaluations , employee-surveys , independent-audits , and reviews of business-processes . the missions of the customs service-the oldest federal agency-are to ensure that goods and persons entering and exiting the united states comply with all u.s. laws and regulations , while also facilitating the legitimate-movement of goods and persons through u.s. ports . but long-standing-management-problems , including-weaknesses in strategic-planning , had threatened the agency 's ability to adapt to changing-demands . customs ' strategic-planning-efforts now focus on the dramatic-changes occurring in its external and internal-environments and on the equally-dramatic changes the agency will need to make in response . recognizing that the international-trade-environment has undergone many changes in recent years , the customs service identified the new challenges these changes brought it in its 1993 strategic-plan . the clearest challenge for customs would be to manage a workload that was growing rapidly and that could not be expected to taper off . from fiscal year 1986 to 1995 , for example , total-import-entries increased by 242 percent , from 11.1 million to 38.0 million . during the same period , passenger-arrivals increased by 42 percent , from 304 million to 431 million . customs anticipated that world-trade would also continue to accelerate . during 1995 alone , approximately 10for a discussion of environmental-monitoring as a critical-aspect of strategic-thinking , see henry mintzberg , the fall and rise of strategic-planning ( new york : free press and prentice hall international , 1994 ) . page 17 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act practice 3 : align activities , core-processes , and resources $ 761 billion in merchandise was imported into the united states . for the rest of the decade , customs expects that figure to grow by more than 10 percent each year . customs anticipated that trade-issues would assume greater prominence in the coming years as developing countries continue to industrialize , corporations continue to expand internationally , and trade-barriers continue to fall . further , the proliferation of international-trade-agreements , such as the u.s.-canada free trade agreement of 1989 , the north american free trade agreement , and the general-agreement on tariffs and trade , should lead to further increases in trade and travel-volume . internally , customs anticipated that as public-pressures to reduce the federal-deficit continued , no real-growth would occur in the agency 's funding . customs also anticipated-attrition among its staff and a loss of valuable-expertise due to that attrition . it determined that by 1998 about 10 percent , or about 2,000 employees , would be eligible to retire . all of these forces-external and internal-have caused the customs service to begin to reengineer its core-processes , including those related to the movement of people and cargo into the united states and the movement of cargo out of the united states . for example , the agency is undertaking a major-reorganization structured from the ground up , using its 301 ports as its foundation . while headquarters-staffing is to be streamlined , the staffing-levels at the ports are to be maintained or increased . under the reorganization , port-directors are to be given some of the authority previously exercised at the district or regional-levels . it is too soon to tell how effective-customs ' reorganization will be in responding to the pressures it faces . but by assessing its external and internal-environments , the agency came to see that its traditional-ways of pursuing its mission were no longer-viable and that major-changes would be needed . leading-organizations recognize that sound-planning is not enough to ensure their success . an organization 's activities , core-processes , and resources must be aligned to support its mission and help it achieve its goals . such organizations start by assessing the extent to which their programs and activities contribute to meeting their mission and desired-outcomes . as the organizations became more results-oriented , they often page 18 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act found it necessary to fundamentally alter activities and programs so that they more effectively and efficiently produced the services to meet customers ' needs and stakeholders ' interests . for example , we have traced the management-problems of many federal-agencies to organizational-structures that are obsolete and inadequate to modern demands.11 as federal-agencies become more outcome-oriented , they will find that outmoded organizational-structures must be changed to better meet customer-needs and address the interests of stakeholders . as agencies align their activities to support mission-related-goals , they should also make better linkages between levels of funding and their anticipated-results . under a series of initiatives called connecting-resources to results , omb is seeking to adopt a greater focus on agencies ' goals and performance in making-funding-decisions . for example , omb fiscal year 1996 budget preparation-guidance said agencies were to identify key-features of their streamlining-plans ( e.g. , increased span of control , reduced organizational-layers , and/or milestones for full-time-equivalents ) and encouraged-agencies to include performance-goals and indicators in their budget justifications.12 whereas the agencies ' fiscal year 1995 documents discussed streamlining primarily in terms of the number of positions to be eliminated , the fiscal year 1996 budget documents included-discussions about how proposed-staff-reductions could affect the agencies ' performance . under omb 's guidance , agencies ' fiscal year 1997-budget-requests were to contain a significantly greater amount of performance-information to help define funding-levels and projected-program-results . for the fiscal year 1998 budget , omb plans to continue to increase the role of performance-goals and information in guiding-funding-decisions . we also have found that leading-organizations strive to ensure that their core-processes efficiently and effectively-support mission-related-outcomes . these organizations rely increasingly on a well-defined-mission to form the foundation for the key-business systems and processes they use to ensure the successful-outcome of their operations . for example , many successful public and private-organizations integrate their human-resource-management activities into their organizational-missions , rather than treating them as an isolated support function.13 this sort of integrated-approach may include tying individual-performance-management , career 11government management-issues ( gao/ocg-93-3tr , dec. 1992 ) . 12office of management and budget : changes resulting from the omb 2000 reorganization ( gao/ggd/aimd-96-50 , dec. 29 , 1995 ) . 13gao/ggd-96-35 , dec. 26 , 1995 . page 19 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act case-illustration : federal emergency management agency development-programs , and pay and promotion-standards to organizational-mission , vision , and culture . information-management is another activity that organizations must address in aligning their activities and processes.14 modern-information management-approaches , coupled with new information technology , can make success more or less likely-depending on the way they are handled . we found that successful-organizations pursue something called strategic-information-management-that is , comprehensive-management of information and information technology to maximize improvements in mission-performance . strategic-information-management will be an important part of any federal-agency 's attempt to implement gpra successfully . managing better requires that agencies have , and rely upon , sound financial and program-information . strategic-information-management would lead to systems that would better provide federal-agencies the data they need in considering-ways to realign their processes , reduce costs , improve program-effectiveness , and ensure consistent-results with a less bureaucratic-organization . lacking these data , the agencies would be missing one of the indispensable-ingredients of successful management . established in 1979 , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) is responsible for the coordination of civil-emergency planning and mitigation as well as the coordination of federal disaster-relief . fema is responsible for responding to floods , hurricanes , earthquakes , and other natural-disasters . hurricane hugo and the loma prieta earthquake in 1989 generated intense criticism of the federal-response-effort . hurricane andrew , which leveled much of south florida in 1992 , raised further doubts as to whether fema was capable of responding to disasters . in 1993 , fema 's new director refocused the agency on meeting its mission and aligning its activities to better serve the public . since fema issued its mission-statement in april 1993 , it has been reexamining its approach to limiting-deaths and property losses from disasters . traditionally , fema had concentrated its efforts on post-disaster-assistance . but after taking a hard-look at its performance , fema concluded that it could better fulfill its mission by addressing the range of activities available before , during , and after disaster-strikes . 14gao/aimd-94-115 , may 1994 . as part of its first agencywide strategic-planning-effort , fema comprehensively reviewed its programs and structures and initiated a major-reorganization in november 1993 . fema concluded that all emergencies share certain common-traits , pose some common-demands , and ought to be approached functionally . fema 's new , `` all-hazard '' mission takes a multifaceted , sequential-approach to managing disasters : mitigation , preparedness , response , and recovery . fema now focuses its disaster-planning and response-processes on steps that need to be taken , not just during and after the event , but in advance . to build preparedness , fema now seeks to build partnerships with other federal , state , and local-organizations . for example , the agency is working with local governments and the building-industry to strengthen building-codes so that structures will be better able to withstand disasters . it has also launched an effort to increase the number of flood-insurance policyholders-something that had not been a traditional-focus of the agency but that is now understood as being critical to helping individuals recover from disasters . by more closely aligning its activities , processes , and resources with its mission , fema appears today to be better positioned to accomplish that mission . the second key-step that successful-results-oriented organizations we studied take-after defining their missions and desired outcomes-is to measure their performance . measuring-performance allows these organizations to track the progress they are making toward their goals and gives managers crucial information on which to base their organizational and management-decisions . leading-organizations recognize , as well , that performance-measures can create powerful-incentives to influence organizational and individual-behavior . gpra incorporates performance-measurement as one of its most important-features . under the act , executive-branch-agencies are required to develop annual-performance-plans that use-performance measurement to reinforce the connection between the long-term strategic-goals outlined in their strategic-plans and the day-to-day-activities of their managers and staff . the annual-performance-plans are to include performance-goals for an agency's program-activities as listed in the budget , a summary of the necessary-resources to conduct these activities , the performance-indicators that will be used to measure-performance , and a discussion of how the performance-information will be verified . for the first time , gpra requires that agencies ' annual-program-performance planning-efforts be linked directly to their budget-estimates and obligations . this linkage is achieved by requiring performance-goals and measures for agencies ' program-activities that are included in their budget-requests . congress recognized that the activity-structure in the budget of the united states government is not consistent across various-programs . as a result , congress expects agencies to consolidate , aggregate , or disaggregate the lists of program-activities appearing in the budget-accounts . the first of these annual-performance-plans is to cover fiscal year 1999 ; each agency is to submit its plan to omb in the fall of 1997 . however , omb is requiring-descriptions of the proposed performance-goals and indicators for fiscal year 1999 with the agency 's fiscal year 1998-budget-request . in developing gpra , congress recognized that federal agencies-unaccustomed as they are to the practice-may find that developing-performance-measures is a difficult and time-consuming task . as a result , it provided for selected-agencies and programs to pilot gpra 's goal-setting and performance-measurement requirements before these are applied governmentwide . our work with leading-results-oriented organizations confirmed that many agencies may need years to develop a sound-set of performance-measures . page 23 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act practice 4 : produce a set of performance-measures at each organizational-level that demonstrate-results , are limited to the vital few , respond to multiple-priorities , and link to responsible-programs we learned , as well , that agencies that were successful in measuring their performance generally had applied two practices . first , they developed-performance-measures based on four characteristics . these measures were ( 1 ) tied to program-goals and demonstrated the degree to which the desired results were achieved , ( 2 ) limited to a vital few that were considered essential for producing-data for decisionmaking , ( 3 ) responsive to multiple-priorities , and ( 4 ) responsibility-linked to establish accountability for results . second , recognizing that they must balance their ideal performance-measurement-systems against real-world-considerations , such as the cost and effort involved in gathering and analyzing-data , the organizations we studied made sure that the data they did collect were sufficiently-complete , accurate , and consistent to be useful in decisionmaking . as the leading-organizations we studied strive to align their activities and resources to achieve mission-related-goals , they also seek to establish clear-hierarchies of performance-goals and measures . under these hierarchies , the organizations try to link the goals and performance-measures for each organizational-level to successive-levels and ultimately to the organization 's strategic-goals . they have recognized that without clear , hierarchically linked performance-measures , managers and staff throughout the organization will lack straightforward-roadmaps showing how their daily-activities can contribute to attaining-organizationwide strategic-goals and mission . federal-agencies that are developing such hierarchies for their organizations are finding that organizationwide performance-measurement-efforts take time and require the active-involvement of staff at all organizational-levels . the experiences of leading-state , foreign , and federal-governments show that at least four characteristics are common to successful-hierarchies of performance measures.15 these characteristics include the following : demonstrate-results : performance-measures should tell each organizational-level how well it is achieving its goals . yet , simple as this principle may appear , it poses an especially difficult-challenge for federal-managers , for whom the link between federal-efforts and desired-outcomes is often-difficult to establish and may not , in fact , be apparent for years . research-programs provide one example . so do many health and 15managing for results : critical-actions for measuring-performance ( gao/t-ggd/aimd-95-187 , june 20 , 1995 ) . welfare-programs that are delivered jointly with state and local governments and third-party-service-deliverers . limited to the vital few : the number of measures for each goal at a given organizational-level should be limited to the vital few . those vital few measures should cover the key-performance dimensions that will enable an organization to assess accomplishments , make decisions , realign-processes , and assign accountability . organizations that seek to manage an excessive number of performance-measures may risk creating a confusing-excess of data that will obscure rather than clarify performance-issues . limiting the number of performance-measures to the vital few at each organizational-level will not only keep the focus where it belongs , it will help ensure that the costs involved in collecting and analyzing the data do not become prohibitive . as a result , lower organizational-levels may use different-measures and goals from those meaningfully or appropriately included in the organization 's annual-performance-plan . likewise , agencies will have more goals and measures than can be meaningfully or appropriately included in the governmentwide-performance plan omb will develop under gpra . however , as performance-plans are compiled for higher organizational-levels , the consolidation and possible exclusion of some goals and measures does not mean that those goals and measures are not important to guide the efforts of the lower levels and should still be monitored . respond to multiple-priorities : government agencies often face a variety of interests whose competing-demands continually force policymakers and managers to balance quality , cost , customer satisfaction , stakeholder-concerns , and other factors . performance-measurement-systems must take these competing-interests into account and create incentives for managers to strike the difficult balance among competing-demands . performance-measurement-efforts that overemphasize one or two priorities at the expense of the others may skew the agency 's performance and keep its managers from seeing the whole-picture . link to responsible-programs : performance-measures should be linked directly to the offices that have responsibility for making programs work . a clear-connection between performance-measures and program-offices helps to both reinforce accountability and ensure that , in their day-to-day-activities , managers keep in mind the outcomes their organization is striving to achieve . this connection at the program-office helps to lay the groundwork for accountability as measures advance through the agency . by helping to lay the groundwork for accountability , a connection between page 25 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act case-illustration : national oceanic and atmospheric administration performance-measures and program-offices also provides a basis for determining the appropriate-degree of operational-authority for various organizational-levels . managers must have the authority and flexibility for achieving the results for which they are to be held accountable . the mission of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) is to describe and predict changes in the earth 's environment , as well as to conserve and manage the nation's coastal and marine-resources to ensure sustainable economic-opportunities . noaa concluded in its 1995 strategic-plan-that the nation 's ability to prepare for severe-weather-events , including tornadoes , thunderstorms , hurricanes , and flash-flooding , depends on the quality and timeliness of the agency 's observations , assessments , and information-delivery . through strategic-planning , noaa evaluated how best to accomplish its mission and then put into place those performance-measures essential to demonstrating the extent to which it was attaining its desired-outcomes . noaa determined that the most important-business of its short-term-warning and forecast-weather-services was to predict the time and location of weather-events and to do so with accuracy . rather than simply count the number of forecasts it made-that is , to simply gather data on its activity-level-noaa began to measure the extent to which it could increase the lead-time or advance-notice it gave the public prior to severe-weather-events . it decided , in other words , to measure what counts . noaa reported that from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1995 , its lead-time for predicting-tornadoes increased from 7 minutes to 9 minutes , and the accuracy of its predictions increased from 47 percent of the time to 60 percent of the time . for fiscal year 1996 , noaa has set-targets of 10 minutes and 64 percent , respectively . noaa also measured how accurately it could predict the range where hurricanes would reach land , given a 24-hour lead-time . from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1995 , its accuracy improved from 185 kilometers ( 115 miles ) to 134 kilometers ( 83 miles ) . it credited the improvement to its installation in june 1995 of a new hurricane-tracking-model . on the basis of fiscal year 1995 performance , noaa revised its fiscal year 1996 target from 155 kilometers ( 96 miles ) to 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) . although the new fiscal year 1996 target of 150 kilometers is higher than the fiscal year 1995 actual-performance of 134 kilometers , noaa wants to test the new page 26 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act practice 5 : collect sufficiently-complete , accurate , and consistent-data model through at least another hurricane-season before radically revising its targets for future-years . the significance of earlier and more accurate-hurricane-warnings is enormous . most importantly , they help prevent deaths and injuries . but they also save money , because earlier and more accurate-predictions of hurricane-tracks and intensities can reduce the size of the warning-areas in which people are advised to prepare for the event . noaa calculated that for each hurricane , the public 's preparation and evacuation-costs exceed $ 50 million , but improved predictions can cut that cost by $ 5 million . in addition , noaa officials believe that the public takes more accurate forecasts more seriously-which helps lessen loss of life and property . as the organizations we examined developed their performance-measures , they paid special-attention to issues relating to data-collection . although they recognized that adequate and reliable-performance data are indispensable to decisionmaking , they were also aware that collecting the data can be costly and difficult . as a result , as agencies implement gpra , they will have to balance the cost of data-collection-efforts against the need to ensure that the collected-data are complete , accurate , and consistent enough to document-performance and support decisionmaking at various organizational-levels . as the experiences of these organizations demonstrated , managers striving to reach organizational-goals must have information-systems in place to provide them with needed information.16 in texas , for example , officials said that the state restructured its statewide-information-systems to include the missions and goals of its agencies , specific-strategies for achieving-objectives , and measures of progress . the system also linked budgeted-expenditures , accounting-information , and performance-data . our work has shown consistently that the federal government's basic financial and information-management-systems are woefully out of date and incapable of meeting modern-needs for fast , reliable , and accurate information-particularly as these needs relate to financial-reporting and program-costs . as the leading-organizations we studied became more results-oriented , many of them made significant-investments in their information-management-systems . many federal-agencies will need to do the same . but agencies can keep costs down by applying the performance-measurement-principles these leading-organizations have employed and 16gao/ggd-95-22 , dec. 21 , 1994 . case-illustration : national highway-traffic safety administration also-where they can-by building performance-data collection into the processes that govern daily-operations , rather than creating entirely new and separate data-collection-systems . the national highway-traffic safety administration 's ( nhtsa ) mission is to reduce casualties and economic-losses resulting from motor-vehicle-crashes . to accomplish its mission , nhtsa pursues two main-strategies : setting and enforcing safety performance-standards for motor-vehicles and promoting safe-driving-behavior . after it was established in 1970 , nhtsa concluded that reliable-crash statistics-databases were needed . the need was twofold : to help in identifying and analyzing traffic safety problems and for evaluating the effectiveness of motor-vehicle safety-standards and highway-safety-initiatives . to fill this need , nhtsa developed-data collection-systems derived from existing-data-sources and has taken steps to ensure the completeness , accuracy , and consistency of these data . nhtsa has developed two data-systems that , taken together , serve as a single-source of motor-vehicle crash statistics . the fatal-accident reporting-system has enabled nhtsa to document that the rate for one of its desired outcomes-reduction in the fatality rate-decreased from 2.3 to an estimated 1.7 per 100 million-vehicle-miles of travel from 1988 to 1995.17 also , nhtsa has used-data from the general-estimates system to document another one of its desired outcomes-a-reduction in injury-rates-from 169 to an estimated 138 injuries per 100 million-vehicle-miles of travel from 1988 to 1995 . the fatal-accident reporting-system contains accident-data provided by the 50 states , puerto rico , and the district of columbia . according to nhtsa documents , throughout the states , puerto rico , and the district of columbia , trained-state-employees gather and transmit these data to nhtsa 's central-computer-database in a standard-format . state employees obtain data solely from each state 's existing documents-including police accident reports , vehicle-registration-files , and vital-statistics records-and then enter them into a central-computer-database . nhtsa analysts periodically review a sample of the cases . the general-estimates system contains data from a nationally representative-sample of police-reported-accidents . to compile the 17vehicle-miles of travel is published by the federal highway administration , as reported by state-highway-agencies , and is based on formal-guidance provided by the administration . page 28 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act database , nhtsa data-collectors randomly-sample about 48,000 reports each year from approximately 400-police-jurisdictions in 60 sites across the country , according to nhtsa documents . nhtsa staff then interpret and code the data directly from the reports into a central electronic-data-file . the data are checked for consistency during both coding and subsequent-processing . nhtsa has recognized that its data have limitations . for example , the general-estimates system is based on police-reports , but various-sources suggest that about half of the motor-vehicle-crashes in the country are not reported to police , and the majority of these unreported-crashes involve only minor-property-damage and no significant-injury . a nhtsa study of the costs of motor-vehicle injuries estimated the total-count of nonfatal-injuries at over 5 million compared to the general-estimates system estimate for that year of 3.2 million . nhtsa intends to study the unreported-injury problem . the third key-step in building successful-results-oriented organizations- after establishing an organizational-mission and goals and building a performance-measurement-system-is to put performance-data to work . managers should use-performance information to continuously improve organizational-processes , identify performance-gaps , and set improvement goals.18 when the cfo act and gpra are fully implemented , decisionmakers are to routinely receive the performance and cost-information they need to assess their programs and make informed-decisions . congressional-decisionmaking should also benefit . gpra was intended , in part , to improve congressional-decisionmaking by giving congress comprehensive and reliable-information on the extent to which federal-programs are fulfilling their statutory intent . the act requires that each agency report annually to the president and to congress on its performance-specifically , on the extent to which it is meeting its annual-performance-goals and the actions needed to achieve or modify those goals that have not been met . annual-performance-reports are intended to provide important-information to agency-managers , policymakers , and the public on what each agency accomplished with the resources it was given . the first of these reports , covering fiscal year 1999 , is due by march 31 , 2000 . in crafting gpra , congress recognized that different-information users would have differing-information-needs . federal-agencies must determine what information is both relevant and essential to different internal and external-information-users and include only the information the users require.19 most important , agency-managers need performance-information to ensure that programs meet intended goals , assess the efficiency of processes , and promote continuous-improvement . congress needs information on whether and in what respects a program is working well or poorly to support its oversight of agencies and their budgets.20 agencies ' stakeholders need performance-information to accurately judge program-effectiveness . in short , we have found that leading-organizations that progressed the farthest to results-oriented-management did not stop after strategic-planning and performance-measurement . they applied their acquired knowledge and data to identify gaps in their performance , report on that 18gao/t-ggd/aimd-95-187 , june 20 , 1995 . 19chief financial-officers council , streamlining-governmentwide statutory-reports ( jan. 17 , 1995 ) . 20managing for results : status of the government-performance and results act ( gao/t-ggd-95-193 , june 27 , 1995 ) ; and program-evaluation : improving the information-flow to the congress ( gao/pemd-95-1 , jan. 30 , 1995 ) . practice 6 : identify performance-gaps performance , and finally use that information to improve their performance to better support their missions . performance-data can have real-value only if they are used to identify the gap between an organization 's actual-performance-level and the performance-level it has identified as its goal . once the performance-gaps are identified for different-program-areas , managers can determine where to target their resources to improve overall-mission-accomplishment . when managers are forced to reduce their resources , the same analysis can help them target reductions to keep to a minimum the threat to their organization 's overall-mission . the leading-organizations we studied recognized that improvement-goals should flow from a fact-based-performance-analysis and be rooted in organizational missions.21 such organizations typically assess which of their processes are in greatest need of improvement in terms of cost , quality , and timeliness . by analyzing the gap between where they are and where they need to be to achieve desired-outcomes , management can target those processes that are in most need of improvement , set realistic-improvement-goals , and select an appropriate process-improvement technique.22 one technique these organizations used is benchmarking-comparing their processes with those of private and public-organizations that are thought to be the best in their fields . by benchmarking its own processes against those of the best in the business , an organization can learn how much-change it needs to make and what changes might be the right ones . case-illustration : veterans health administration the veterans health administration ( vha ) in the department of veterans affairs runs one of the nation 's largest medical care delivery-systems , consisting of a network of medical-centers , nursing-homes , domiciliaries , and outpatient-clinics that provide health-care-services to nearly 2.8 million patients each year . vha recognizes that its ability to survive growing-market-pressures , answer criticisms of health-care-quality , and sustain and improve services to an aging-veteran-population depends on its ability to analyze data to pinpoint areas needing-change and improvement . vha has initiated numerous-studies 21government-reform : using-reengineering and technology to improve government-performance ( gao/t-ocg-95-2 , feb. 2 , 1995 ) . 22gao/t-ggd/aimd-95-187 , june 20 , 1995 . page 32 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act to identify performance-gaps . with better data in hand , vha is taking-actions to improve its products and services . vha has provided medical care to veterans for over 60 years . traditionally , however , the agency has lacked the sort of data needed to assess the quality , cost , and effectiveness of its care . vha 's current-data analysis efforts are structured to provide caregivers with improved-data on medical-outcomes . it has begun to use this performance-information to improve service to veterans . an example is vha 's effort to benchmark the success of cardiac surgeries in vha facilities . vha 's database , which contains over 51,000 records on cardiac surgical-outcomes , is risk-adjusted for severity of illness on the basis of 54 variables , including-age and previous medical-history , collected prior to surgery . vha was able to identify the differences in surgical-outcomes among the 43 vha medical-centers performing cardiac-surgery . on the basis of these analyses , vha recommended a number of techniques and processes for shortening the postoperative-hospital-stay , decreasing excessive diagnostic-testing , and reducing the risk of postoperative infections or complications . according to vha , because it adopted these and other techniques , the performance-data show that cardiac teams lowered their mortality-rates for all cardiac-procedures over the last 8 years by an average of 13 percent . another vha data-analysis-effort is the external-peer-review program . the program compares vha medical-centers ' performances against established community-standards . as part of the effort , panels composed of physicians not affiliated with vha review medical-records to determine if community-standards have been met . one performance-gap vha identified through this benchmarking was the low-vaccination-rate of elderly and chronically-ill vha patients who are at high risk for contracting one type of potentially fatal-pneumonia . vha has worked with the national institute on aging in the department of health and human-services and the american lung association to raise its pneumonia immunization-rate for these patients from 19 percent to 29 percent over the past 2 years . vha also is analyzing-performance-data to switch some of its focus from inpatient to ambulatory-care . for example , according to vha , after careful-data-analysis , its medical-center in little rock , arkansas , determined that only a small-percentage of the patients admitted to its 28-day inpatient-detoxification-program needed acute medical-attention . as a result , the program was converted in fiscal year 1995 to an outpatient-program with page 33 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act only a small-inpatient-capacity . the center reportedly now serves more patients with eight fewer full-time-staff-members and anticipates that savings from the first year of the new outpatient-program will be $ 600,000-with no lessening in the quality of patient-care . no picture of what the government is accomplishing with the taxpayers ' money can be complete without adequate-program-cost and performance-information . but this information must be presented in a way that is useful to the many audiences who rely on it to help them assess and manage federal programs.23 viewing program-performance in light of program-costs-for-instance , by establishing the unit-cost per output or outcome-achieved-can be important on at least two levels . first , it can help congress make informed-decisions . second , it can give the taxpayers a better understanding of what the government is providing in return for their tax-dollars . consistent with gpra 's requirement that annual-performance-plans be tied to budget-requests , the annual-performance-reports , which are to report progress toward achieving the goals established in the plans , are to link levels of performance to the budget expenditures . directly calculating unit-cost information will likely become more widespread when the government-management reform act of 1994 ( gmra ) is implemented . gmra authorized omb , upon proper notification to congress , to consolidate and simplify management-reports . the cfo council has proposed that agencies prepare two annual-reports : a planning and budgeting report and an accountability report . the two consolidated-reports would be used to present each agency 's past financial and program-performance and provide a roadmap for its future-planning and budgeting-actions . at present , omb is having six agencies produce accountability-reports on a pilot-basis . the accountability report would eliminate the separate-requirements under various-laws-such as gpra , the federal-managers ' financial-integrity act , the cfo act , and the prompt-payment act . practice 7 : report-performance information case-illustration : gpra pilot-projects ' fiscal year 1994 performance-reports gpra requires that each federal-agency-report annually on its performance-specifically , on the degree to which the agency is meeting its annual-performance-goals and on the actions needed to achieve those goals that have not been met . under gpra , omb was required to select agencies to pilot gpra performance-planning and reporting 23financial management : continued-momentum essential to achieve cfo act goals ( gao/t-aimd-96-10 , dec. 14 , 1995 ) . requirements . forty-four-pilot-projects submitted reports for the first round of performance-reporting in 1995 . we identified some individual-features that when viewed as a whole , appear to have the potential for enhancing the general-usefulness of future performance-reports in providing-decisionmakers and the public with the information needed to assess progress.24 these features would also be appropriate for gmra accountability-reports . our initial-observations suggest that gpra performance-reports are likely to be more useful if they • describe the relationship between the agency 's annual-performance and its strategic-goals and mission , • include cost-information , • provide baseline and trend-data , • explain the uses of performance-information , • incorporate other relevant-information , and • present-performance-information in a user-friendly manner . by describing how the annual-performance-information it has reported relates to its strategic-goals and mission , an agency can help its customers and stakeholders understand the relationship between the year 's accomplishments and the agency 's long-range-goals and reason for existence . by including-cost information-ideally , unit-cost per output or outcome-the-agency can demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and productivity of its program-efforts . in addition , by providing-baseline and trend-data-which show the agency 's progress over time-the-agency can give decisionmakers a more historical-perspective within which to compare the year 's performance with performance in past-years . similarly , by explaining the uses of the performance information-such as the actions the agency has taken or identified as needed , based on the data-the-agency can help decisionmakers judge the reasonableness of its performance-goals and decide upon actions they may need to take to improve the agency 's performance . the report should include any other information that is relevant-such as the limitations in the quality of the reported data-that-users of the report may need to help them better understand the performance-data and its context . it is important , as well , that the text be understandable to the nontechnical reader-that it use clearly defined terms and appropriate , user-friendly-tables and graphs to convey information as readily as possible . 24gpra performance-reports ( gao/ggd-96-66r , feb. 14 , 1996 ) . practice 8 : use-performance information to support mission as efforts continue to reduce federal-spending , policymakers and the public alike are reexamining the federal government 's spending priorities . federal-agencies are feeling the pressure to demonstrate that they are putting the taxpayers ' money to sound use . they are expected to demonstrate improved-performance even as they cut costs-two simultaneous-demands that are driving the trend toward results-oriented-government . as they focus on the outcomes they hope to achieve , federal-managers increasingly are finding that the traditional-ways they measured their success-and thus the traditional-ways they did business and provided-services-are no longer-appropriate or practical . for example , the new focus on outcomes is prompting some federal-agencies to alter the approach of their programs , including working more closely with states and local governments and businesses . as agencies create information-systems to provide them with cost and performance-data , they discover that having the facts gives them a basis for focusing their efforts and improving their performance . case-illustration : coast guard the mission of the coast guard 's office of marine-safety , security and environmental-protection is to protect the public , the environment , and u.s. economic-interests through the prevention and mitigation ofmarine-incidents . in the past , the coast guard 's marine-safety-program concentrated on the physical-condition of vessels , through activities such as inspections and certifications . the program focused less attention on the human-factors that contribute to marine-safety . but as the office became more outcome-oriented and made more extensive-use of performance-information , it began to redirect its safety-efforts . coast guard data indicate that its mission-effectiveness is now dramatically improved . traditionally , the coast guard based its marine-safety-efforts on inspections and certifications of vessels . it measured its performance by counting-outputs , such as the number of prior inspections and outstanding-inspection-results . but the data on marine-casualties indicated that accidents were often caused , not by deficiencies in the vessels or other factors , but by human error . for example , towing-industry-data for 1982 through 1991 showed that 18 percent of reported casualties were caused by equipment and material-failures , 20 percent by environmental and other factors , and 62 percent by human-factors . page 36 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act putting this information to use , the coast guard changed the focus of its marine-safety-program from outputs to outcomes in its first business plan , dated january 1994 . after all , it came to recognize , the mission of the marine-safety-program was not to do more and better inspections of vessels , but to save lives . as a result , the coast guard shifted its resources and realigned its processes away from inspections and toward other efforts to reduce marine-casualties . in addition , it identified a significant-role for the towing-industry in the marine-safety-program and looked for opportunities to work with its stakeholders in the towing-industry to reduce casualties in their field . the coast guard and the towing-industry worked to build the knowledge and skills of entry-level-crew-members in the industry . the coast guard and the towing-industry jointly developed-training and voluntary-guidelines to reduce the causes of fatalities . this joint-effort contributed to a significant-decline in the reported towing-industry fatality rate : from 91 per 100,000 industry employees in 1990 to 27 per 100,000 in 1995 . the marine-safety-program apparently not only improved its mission-effectiveness , but did so with fewer people and at lower cost . since the coast guard 's marine-safety-program became a gpra pilot-program in fiscal year 1994 , the number of direct-program personnel declined and its budget was reduced by 2 percent . according to the coast guard , the program achieved its results by giving-field-commanders greater authority and by investing in activities and processes that went most directly to the goal of reducing-risks on the water . gpra will not succeed without the strong-commitment of the federal government 's political and senior-career-leadership . only they can ensure that each agency 's strategic-planning and performance-measurement-efforts will become the basis for its day-to-day-operations . moreover , only they can ensure that results-oriented-management will endure despite the customarily high rate of turnover among political appointees.25 some of the practices they can take to reinforce results-oriented-management are to • devolve-decisionmaking-authority within a framework of mission-oriented-processes in exchange for accountability for results , • create incentives to encourage a focus on outcomes , • build expertise in the necessary-skills , and • integrate management-reforms . if gpra is to thrive over the long run , its concepts need to be made a part of organizational-culture . for that to happen , the top-leadership in each agency has to initiate results-oriented-management , keep the agency focused on it , and embed its principles in the organization 's basic-approach to doing business.26 practice 9 : devolve-decisionmaking with accountability leading-organizations we studied create a set of mission-related processes and systems within which to operate , but they then give their managers extensive-authority to pursue organizational-goals while using those processes and systems . these organizations invest the time and effort to understand their processes and how those processes contribute to or hamper mission-accomplishment . they then seek to ensure their processes provide managers at each organizational-level with the authority and flexibility they need to contribute to the organization 's mission . allowing-managers to bring their judgment to bear in meeting their responsibilities , rather than having them merely comply with overly rigid-rules and standards , can help them make the most of their talents and lead to more effective and efficient-operations . in our work with foreign-countries that have adopted results-oriented-management , we found that two reforms in particular were aimed at enhancing-accountability among line-managers : simplifying the rules for such things as budgeting and human-resource-management while 25political-appointees : turnover-rates in executive schedule positions requiring senate confirmation ( gao/ggd-94-115fs , apr . 21 , 1994 ) . 26organizational culture : techniques-companies use to perpetuate or change beliefs and values ( gao/nsiad-92-105 , feb. 27 , 1992 ) . case-illustration : army corps of engineers devolving-decisionmaking authority.27 these two reforms were undertaken in exchange for managers assuming greater accountability for the results of their programs . managers generally welcomed their new authority to make spending , personnel , and operational-decisions that had formerly been made by central-authorities . but although these countries were generally-satisfied with the progress they had made , they continued to struggle with a number of important-issues , such as the acceptable-level of risk and the extent to which decisionmaking-authority should be devolved to a given organizational-level . the u.s. army corps of engineers ' civil works directorate's operation and maintenance program is responsible for the stewardship of dams , levees , and other parts of the water-resources infrastructure constructed by the corps . operation and maintenance expenditures had become by fiscal year 1990 the single largest individual-program-item in the corps ' budget . in 1991 , faced with rising-budget-pressures , a growing-project-inventory , and the need to become more results-oriented , the corps initiated a comprehensive-review of its civil-operation and maintenance program . one major-finding of the corps ' 1993 plan of improvement was the burdensome-number of internal-levels of review . at the majority of project-sites , for example , procurement of items costing less than $ 25,000 required between one and five signatures ; each approval beyond the first one added to the time required for the procurement and created-inefficiency , revenue-loss , and a potential-danger to the staff and public when safety-corrections were delayed . to remedy this situation , the corps changed its processes by decentralizing its organizational-structure and giving-project managers new decisionmaking-authority to help them achieve the desired-outcomes . the intent of these changes was to put key operational-decisions in the hands of the managers who were closest to the point of customer service . these managers could now focus on , and be held accountable for , achieving-goals instead of merely complying with rules . now procurements of up to $ 25,000 can be approved by a single-individual . as part of this new approach , the corps reformed its processes , revising its policies and procedures to ensure that only those that were necessary remained . it achieved this reduction , by and large , by indicating `` what '' 27gao/ggd-95-120 , may 2 , 1995 . practice 10 : create incentives was to be accomplished and leaving the `` how '' to the initiative of project-staff . eighty-nine-engineering-regulations were thereby consolidated into 7 , and the number of pages of corps ' regulations was reduced from 1,596 to 306 . this streamlining of its organization and processes allowed the corps to reduce the number of its management-levels . by the corps' estimate , the savings created amounted to about $ 6 million annually and a reduction of 175 full-time equivalent-staff-years . across government , the best incentive congress and the executive-branch can apply to foster results-oriented-management is to use-performance measurement data in their policy , program , and resource-allocation-decisions and to provide agencies with the authority and flexibility to achieve results . like congress and the executive-branch , an agency 's top political and career-leadership can encourage a greater accountability for results by providing managers at each level in the organization with the appropriate-authority and flexibility to obtain those results . successful-organizations we studied defined their missions clearly and communicated them to their employees-particularly to their managers-so that each one would understand his or her contribution . at both the organizational and managerial-levels , accountability requires results-oriented-goals and appropriate performance-measures through which to gauge progress . our study of several leading foreign-governments , however , showed that although there was general-agreement on how to hold organizations accountable for results , there was as yet no such agreement on how best to hold individual-managers accountable.28 new zealand and the united kingdom held their program-managers accountable for efficiently providing specific-goods and services . australia and canada , on the other hand , hold their program-managers accountable for evaluating the overall-effectiveness of their programs . congress and the executive-branch continue to explore formal ways to hold individual-managers accountable for results . at the agency-level , however , informal-incentives are available to leaders to encourage results-oriented-management . through meetings and personal-contacts , for example , leaders can let managers and staff know of their commitment to achieving the agency 's goals and to keeping these goals in mind as they pursue their day-to-day-activities . 28gao/ggd-95-120 , may 2 , 1995 . case-illustration : department of veterans affairs the department of veterans affairs ( va ) comprises three agencies that provide services and benefits to veterans . the elevation of va to cabinet-level status in 1989 spurred the department to make internal-management-improvements . to recognize and reinforce results-oriented-management , va instituted in 1992 a formal recognition-program for quality-achievement . the robert w. carey quality award is va 's most prestigious-award for quality-achievement . it is named for robert w. carey , who , as the director of va 's philadelphia regional-office , was a `` quality leader '' and champion of excellence in the federal government . the carey award helps promote quality-management within va by giving the department a prominent-means of recognizing-high-performing offices , encouraging outcome-oriented-practices , and educating va employees about the benefits of results-oriented-management and customer service . according to a va official , the carey award is valuable , in part , because va offices that want it must apply for it and the application itself becomes a useful-self-assessment tool . va announced its first carey award in 1992 . there is one overall trophy-winner annually along with several-category-winners . there have been 20 winners to date . practice 11 : build expertise to make the most of results-oriented-management , staff at all levels of the organization must be skilled in strategic-planning , performance-measurement , and the use of performance-information in decisionmaking . training has proven to be an important-tool for agencies that want to change their cultures.29 australian government-employees , for example , cited-training as one of the factors that contributed the most to making-reforms succeed in their areas.30 results-oriented managers view training as an investment rather than an expense . and as human-resource-management experts at leading private and public-organizations have pointed out , organizational-learning must be continuous in order to meet changing-customer-needs , keep skills up to date , and develop new personal and organizational competencies.31 but at 29organizational culture : use of training to help change dod inventory management culture ( gao/nsiad-94-193 , aug. 30 , 1994 ) . 30gao/ggd-95-120 , may 2 , 1995 . 31gao/ggd-96-35 , dec. 26 , 1995 . page 42 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act case-illustration : department of defense a time when overall-agency-budgets are under pressure , training budgets are unlikely to increase . therefore , it is important that agencies develop innovative and less costly-ways to train their staffs-remembering as well that the level of return for investing in the skills needed for results-oriented-management will depend largely on how well employees are encouraged to put those skills to use . recognizing the value of training , especially for the people at the top of the organization , the cfo council 's gpra-implementation-committee has begun an outreach-effort directed toward senior-managers in the 24 cfo act agencies . the council 's goals are to familiarize these leaders with gpra 's fundamentals and with the importance of these fundamentals for the future of federal-management . in addition , in response to an initiative of the american society for public-administration and with the encouragement of omb , over 30-case-studies are being developed on the agencies ' use of strategic-planning or performance-measurement . these case-studies , to be completed in the summer of 1996 , are to be made publicly-available . the department of defense ( dod ) is responsible for the military forces needed to deter war and protect the security of our country . dod 's major-service-branches-the army , navy , marine corps , and air force-consist of about 1.5 million men and women on active-duty , 1 million members of the reserve-components , and about 900,000 civilian-employees . as with other federal-agencies , performance-information is becoming an increasingly-important part of dod's budget-process . dod 's leadership has come to recognize that if the department is to make results-oriented-management a success , it must train its employees in strategic-planning , performance-measurement , and the use of performance-information . dod officials recognized when they were considering various-methods to deliver gpra training that the costs-in both money and time-of providing-training through traditional , live-classroom instruction would be prohibitive . as an alternative , dod is now testing the feasibility of training-staff at its gpra pilot agencies via satellite . this interactive-approach can reach widely dispersed-audiences less expensively than traditional-methods . the gpra course originates out of a studio and has been broadcast simultaneously to up to 20 sites around the country . since the practice 12 : integrate management-reforms first class in september 1995 , the gpra training has been delivered 3 times via satellite to 38 sites and has reached 760 people . in developing its gpra training , dod decided to go beyond the traditional-lecture-approach to instruction . gpra training has included exercises and panel-discussions designed to make trainees think the way they will need to when the training is over and the real-work of implementing gpra begins . participants have been asked , for instance , to develop mission-statements for their home organizations and to develop strategic-goals and performance-measures . according to a dod official , the classes have been well received . dod is also developing a self-paced gpra course-accessible on the internet and is considering the use of cd-rom technology . within a given federal-agency , the management-reforms now under way may spring from various-sources . some of these reforms may be self-initiated , others may have been mandated by legislation , still others may be the result of administration-initiatives such as the national performance review . all of this reform-activity needs to be integrated , as the cfo council urged in may 1995 : existing-planning , budgeting , program-evaluation and fiscal accountability-processes should be integrated with gpra-requirements to ensure consistency and reduce duplication of effort . in addition , other management-improvement-efforts , such as implementation of the cfo act , and fmfia [ federal managers' financial-integrity act ] , customer-service-initiatives , reengineering , and total quality-management , etc. , should be incorporated into the gpra framework to capitalize on the synergy and availability of key-information and to improve responsiveness to customers and other stakeholders.32 another management-reform-initiative that provides a legislative basis for measuring-performance is the information-technology-management reform act of 1996 , which requires each federal-agency to ensure that performance-measures are prescribed for information technology that it will use or acquire and that the performance-measures assess how well the information technology supports agency-programs . in addition , the federal acquisition streamlining act of 1994 requires the head of each executive-agency to approve or define the cost , performance , and schedule goals for major-agency acquisition-programs . 32implementation of the government-performance and results act ( gpra ) , chief financial-officers council , may 1995 . case-illustration : army research laboratory taken together , these reforms can help redirect an organization 's culture from the traditional-focus on inputs and activities to a new focus on defining-missions and achieving results.33 our work has shown , however , that the top-leadership of each federal-agency needs to meld these various-reforms into a coherent , unified effort.34 top-leadership-both political and career-needs to make clear its commitment to the fundamental-principles of results-oriented-management and ensure that managers and staff at all levels recognize that they must do the same . traditionally , the danger to any management-reform is that it can become a hollow , paper-driven-exercise . leaders who integrate results-oriented-management into the culture and day-to-day-activities of their organizations will help avoid that danger . the army research laboratory ( arl ) was established in october 1992 as a result of a realignment of a number of army research and development-organizations . it is now the central-laboratory of the army materiel command . at a time when both staffing-levels and funding had been in decline since fiscal year 1989 , arl was given a major technological challenge-digitizing the battlefield for the u.s. army . arl concluded that to ensure that it had the capability to meet the new challenge and continue to conduct its mission of basic and applied-research , it had to work in partnership with universities and the private sector , as well as operate more effectively and efficiently . this `` federated laboratory '' concept guided arl as it integrated the various-management-reforms . as a gpra pilot-program , arl developed a strategic-plan-that included a mission-statement and long-range-goals . in addition , it has produced two yearly-products : a performance-plan with key-measures and a report detailing its progress in meeting its goals . the annual-reports have been integrated into arl 's planning and budgeting-processes and are discussed by agency-leadership at the director 's quarterly-meetings . in addition , the reports have been tied into dod 's planning , programming , budget , and execution system . arl 's performance-measures gauge the relevance of arl's current-work to the agency 's long-term-goals and give arl 's leaders indicators of productivity and quality . as part of its performance 33improving-government : actions needed to sustain and enhance management-reforms ( gao/t-ocg-94-1 , jan. 27 , 1994 ) . 34see , for example , managing irs : important-strides-forward since 1988 but more needs to be done ( gao/ggd-91-74 , apr . 29 , 1991 ) ; general services administration : status of management-improvement-efforts ( gao/ggd-91-59 , apr . 3 , 1991 ) ; and management of va : implementing strategic-management process would improve service to veterans ( gao/hrd-90-109 , aug. 31 , 1990 ) . measurement-efforts , arl established customer service standards and sent-surveys to its customers to obtain feedback on the quality of its work . as a national performance review `` reinvention-laboratory , '' arl has been granted waivers by dod and the army from internal regulations in order to streamline its processes . for example , one such waiver allowed arl to eliminate redundant-reviews of certain procurements , thereby saving 5 workdays on each procurement . saving time on administrative-processes frees staff to perform the principal-mission of the laboratory . facing-pressures similar to those confronting federal-managers to reduce costs and improve performance , leading-state and foreign-governments have responded by implementing-management-reform efforts consistent with gpra . the experiences of these governments-and those of the federal gpra pilots-demonstrate that each federal-agency will need to chart its own course in response to its specific-environment as it seeks to implement gpra and become more results-oriented . nonetheless , the experiences of the leading-organizations suggest that the steps and practices discussed in this guide can assist-agencies in successfully-implementing gpra . federal-agencies that apply the practices may find that their transition to a results-orientation is quicker , smoother , and , most important , more successful in providing the effective and efficient-government the american people deserve . appendix i overview of the government-performance and results act the government-performance and results act ( gpra ) is the primary legislative-framework through which agencies will be required to set strategic-goals , measure-performance , and report on the degree to which goals were met . it requires each federal-agency to develop , no later than by the end of fiscal year 1997 , strategic-plans that cover a period of at least 5 years and include the agency 's mission-statement ; identify the agency 's long-term strategic-goals ; and describe how the agency intends to achieve those goals through its activities and through its human , capital , information , and other resources . under gpra , agency strategic-plans are the starting point for agencies to set annual-goals for programs and to measure the performance of the programs in achieving those goals . also , gpra requires each agency to submit to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , beginning for fiscal year 1999 , an annual-performance-plan . the first annual-performance-plans are to be submitted in the fall of 1997 . the annual-performance-plan is to provide the direct-linkage between the strategic-goals outlined in the agency 's strategic-plan and what managers and employees do day-to-day . in essence , this plan is to contain the annual-performance-goals the agency will use to gauge its progress toward accomplishing its strategic-goals and identify the performance-measures the agency will use to assess its progress . also , omb will use individual-agencies ' performance-plans to develop an overall federal government-performance plan that omb is to submit annually to congress with the president 's budget , beginning for fiscal year 1999 . gpra requires that each agency submit to the president and to the appropriate-authorization and appropriations-committees of congress an annual report on program-performance for the previous fiscal year ( copies are to be provided to other congressional-committees and to the public upon request ) . the first of these reports , on program-performance for fiscal year 1999 , is due by march 31 , 2000 , and subsequent-reports are due by march 31 for the years that follow . however , for fiscal-years 2000 and 2001 , agencies ' reports are to include performance-data beginning with fiscal year 1999 . for each subsequent-year , agencies are to include performance-data for the year covered by the report and 3 prior-years . in each report , an agency is to review and discuss its performance compared with the performance-goals it established in its annual-performance-plan . when a goal is not met , the agency's report is to explain the reasons the goal was not met ; plans and schedules for meeting the goal ; and , if the goal was impractical or not feasible , the reasons for that and the actions recommended . actions needed to accomplish a goal could page 48 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act include legislative , regulatory , or other actions or , when the agency found a goal to be impractical or infeasible , a discussion of whether the goal ought to be modified . in addition to evaluating the progress made toward achieving annual-goals established in the performance-plan for the fiscal year covered by the report , an agency 's program-performance-report is to evaluate the agency 's performance-plan for the fiscal year in which the performance-report was submitted ( for example , in their fiscal year 1999-performance-reports , due by march 31 , 2000 , agencies are required to evaluate their performance-plans for fiscal year 2000 on the basis of their reported performance in fiscal year 1999 ) . this evaluation will help to show how an agency 's actual-performance is influencing its plans . finally , the report is to include the summary-findings of program-evaluations completed during the fiscal year covered by the report . congress recognized that in some cases not all of the performance-data will be available in time for the march 31 reporting-date . in such cases , agencies are to provide whatever data are available , with a notation as to their incomplete-status . subsequent annual-reports are to include the complete-data as part of the trend-information . in crafting gpra , congress also recognized that managerial-accountability for results is linked to managers having sufficient flexibility , discretion , and authority to accomplish desired results . gpra authorizes agencies to apply for managerial-flexibility-waivers in their annual-performance-plans beginning with fiscal year 1999 . the authority of agencies to request waivers of administrative procedural-requirements and controls is intended to provide federal-managers with more flexibility to structure agency-systems to better support-program-goals . the nonstatutory requirements that omb can waive under gpra generally involve the allocation and use of resources , such as restrictions on shifting-funds among items within a budget-account . agencies must report in their annual-performance-reports on the use and effectiveness of any gpra managerial-flexibility-waivers that they receive . gpra calls for phased implementation so that selected pilot-projects in the agencies can develop experience from implementing gpra-requirements in fiscal-years 1994 through 1996 before implementation is required for all agencies . as of june 1996 , 68 pilot-projects for performance-planning and performance-reporting were under way in 24 agencies . omb also is required to select at least five agencies from among the initial-pilot-agencies to pilot page 49 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act managerial-accountability and flexibility for fiscal-years 1995 and 1996 ; however , as of june 1996 it had not done so . finally , gpra requires omb to select at least five agencies , at least three of which have had experience developing-performance plans during the initial gpra pilot-phase , to test-performance budgeting for fiscal-years 1998 and 1999 . performance budgets to be prepared by pilot-projects for performance-budgeting are intended to provide congress with information on the direct-relationship between proposed program-spending and expected-program-results and the anticipated-effects of varying-spending-levels on results . appendix ii objectives , scope , and methodology our objectives were to ( 1 ) identify and describe the practices most helpful to successfully-implementing gpra and related results-oriented-management-initiatives and ( 2 ) provide case-illustrations of federal-organizations that have made progress in implementing each practice . this report builds on ( 1 ) our 1994 report profiling leading private and public-sector-organizations that have successfully improved mission-performance and program-outcomes through the innovative-use of information-management and technology and ( 2 ) our 1995 report on the human-resource-management principles employed by selected public and private-organizations to build and sustain high levels of organizational performance.35 together , these reports are intended to suggest frameworks for congress and federal-agencies to use in implementing gpra and related results-oriented-management-initiatives . to meet our first objective , we reviewed the experiences of leading-public sector-organizations that were successfully changing their management and accountability-practices to be more results-oriented . as part of that effort , we issued separate-reports on the experiences of six leading u.s. state and four foreign governments.36 we also reviewed the management-studies of 23 large federal-departments and agencies that we did during the last decade as well as a broad-array of our other management and program-work . to supplement our work looking at leading-organizations , we identified and reviewed a large-body of literature on management-reform , strategic-planning , and performance-measurement . from our work , we identified a number of practices common to successful-efforts to become more results-oriented . we obtained-input from a wide-range of federal-executives and managers and experts in public sector strategic-planning , performance-measurement , and program and policy evaluation , including those from the departments of defense , commerce , transportation , and the treasury ; omb ; the office of personnel-management ; the national academy of public-administration ; the urban institute ; and the university of southern california . on the basis of their comments and our continuing reviews of leading-organizations , we consolidated and refined the list of practices to those presented in this guide . to meet our second objective , we identified those federal-agencies that were instituting results-oriented-management from our ongoing-work on the implementation of gpra at 24 departments and large-agencies ( covering about 98 percent of the federal government 's fiscal year 1994 outlays ) and 35gao/aimd-94-115 , may 1994 ; and gao/ggd-96-35 , dec. 26 , 1995 , respectively . 36gao/ggd-95-22 , dec. 21 , 1994 ; and gao/ggd-95-120 , may 2 , 1995 . the methodologies for selecting these leading-governments are detailed in the respective-reports . page 51 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act omb 's identification of agencies making early-progress in implementing selected aspects of gpra . in this way , we targeted our work toward agencies that would provide examples illustrating each of the practices . the fact that an organization is profiled for a particular-practice is not meant to imply the organization's success or lack of success in meeting other practices . moreover , underscoring the fact that implementing-management-changes required by gpra will not come quickly , most of the agencies profiled began their results-oriented-management before gpra was enacted . we interviewed-agency-officials in program-offices , strategic-planning and quality-management-offices , and planning and evaluation offices . we also reviewed agency-documents , such as strategic-plans , performance-plans , performance-reports , program-descriptions and documentation , and other related-documents . we did our work on this guide from january 1995 to march 1996 in washington , d.c. , in accordance with generally accepted-government-auditing standards . the steps and practices presented in this executive-guide are largely a synthesis of previously published information and analysis . we provided a draft of this guide to omb , the cfo council 's gpra-implementation-committee , and to the individual-agencies profiled in the case-illustrations for their review and comment . omb noted that the guide and the practices suggested in it will help federal-agencies as they implement gpra . omb also expressed-support for the guide 's focus on agency-use of performance-information to improve management and program-performance and to demonstrate that federal-agencies are using-taxpayers ' money effectively . omb concurred with our observation that the federal government is at the beginning , rather than the end , of the process of turning itself into a more accountable , better managed , more effective-organization . finally , omb noted that the development and refinement of performance-measures will be an ongoing-process . we also provided-copies of a draft of this guide for comment to the agency-representatives on the cfo council 's gpra-implementation-committee and incorporated their individual-comments as appropriate . generally , their comments suggested that the steps and practices we identified from the leading-organizations studied were valid and complete , and that the case-illustrations were accurate to the best of their knowledge . we also asked-officials in each of the agencies profiled as case-illustrations to verify the accuracy of the information presented on their respective-agencies ; page 52 gao/ggd-96-118 government-performance and results act however , we did not independently verify the accuracy of that information . appendix iii major-contributors
