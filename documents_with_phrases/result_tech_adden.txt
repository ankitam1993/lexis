technical addendum : methodologies for the benefit-analysis of the clear skies initiative september 2002 i . introduction background the need for multi-pollutant legislation in the united states , power-generation is responsible for 63 % of sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , 22 % of nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) , and 37 % of man-made-mercury released to the environment . once released , these pollutants together with their atmospheric-transformation-products ( e.g . ozone and fine-particles ) can travel long distances before being deposited . environmental and public-health-problems resulting from power-generation-emissions include : • cardiovascular and respiratory-conditions associated with exposure to fine-particles ( pm ) and ozone ; • visibility-impairment associated with regional-haze ; • acidification of surface-waters and forest ecosystems ; • ecosystem and public-health-effects associated with the accumulation of mercury in fish and other wildlife ; • acidic-damage to cultural-monuments and other materials ; • ozone-damage to forested-ecosystems ; and • eutrophication in coastal-areas . while the current clean-air act has played a role in significantly improving some of these issues , additional-reductions in the emissions of so2 , nox , and mercury are necessary to address persistent public health and environmental-problems . because of the regional and global-scale of these pollutants , individual-states or localities experiencing the environmental-effects can not always control them . in addition , current-law tends to address each environmental-problem independently , even if one pollutant contributes to several-problems . to more effectively address the environmental-problems caused by power-generation , there is a need for a national-program that would take advantage of synergies of controlling multiple-pollutants at once . the clear skies act on february 14 , 2002 , the president announced the clear skies initiative , a proposal to reduce emissions from electric-power generating-sources . the proposal was embodied in legislative-form as the clear skies act , which was introduced in the house of representatives as h.r.5266 and in the senate as s.2815 in july 2002 . for the purpose of the analyses presented here , the central-features examined in the initiative are identical to those contained in the act . the clear skies act would reduce emissions of sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) , and mercury from fossil fuel-fired-combustion units by approximately 70 % from current levels.1 these mandatory-emission-reductions would be achieved through a cap-and-trade 1 the clear skies act would cut-sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) emissions by 73 percent , from current-emissions of 11 million tons to caps of 4.5 million tons in 2010 and 3 million tons in 2018 . it would cut-emissions of nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) by 67 percent , from current-emissions of 5 million tons program , modeled on the current acid-rain-program for so2 . federally-enforceable emissions-limits , or national-caps , for each pollutant would be established . sources would be allowed to transfer these authorized emission-limits among themselves to achieve the required-reductions for all three pollutants at the lowest overall-cost . this proposal would alleviate many of the remaining environmental and health problems associated with power-generation . this document reports the methods and results of an analysis of the environmental and health-benefits of the clear skies act . it presents quantitative-estimates of the health-improvements and monetary-benefits that would be achieved by this proposal . summary of the benefits-analysis methods and results the clear skies act would provide significant-benefits to public health and the environment , whether expressed as health and environmental-improvements or as monetized-benefits . these include prolonging-thousands of lives and reducing-tens of thousands to millions of cases in other indicators of adverse-health-effects , such as work-loss-days , restricted-activity-days , and days with asthma-attacks . environmental-benefits include significant-increases in visibility and substantial-improvements in chronically-acidic conditions in lakes in the northeastern us . based on emissions-reductions that would start well before 2010 and the expected increase in benefits between 2010 and 2020 , the cumulative health-benefits of the program across the next two decades would be significant . the key-results of this analysis of the clear skies act are summarized in exhibit 1 . section ii ( analytical approach ) discusses the analytic framework used in conducting this assessment , which includes scenario-development , emissions-modeling , air-quality-modeling , human-health and visibility-effects-estimation , economic-valuation , and adjustments for income-growth and benefits-aggregation . as depicted in exhibit 1 , we have used two approaches to provide benefits in health and environmental-effects and in monetary-terms . while there is a substantial-difference in the specific-estimates , both approaches show that the monetary-benefits of the clear skies act are well in excess of the estimated-costs of $ 3.7 billion in 2010 and $ 6.5 billion in 2020.2 the first approach presented , the base estimate , is a peer-reviewed method developed for previous-risk and benefit-cost assessments carried out by the environmental-protection agency . it is the method used in the regulatory-assessments of the heavy-duty diesel and tier ii rules and the section 812 report to congress . following the approach of these earlier assessments , along with the results of the base estimate , we present various-sensitivity analyses on the base estimate that alter select-subsets of variables ; these sensitivity-analyses yield results as much as 42 percent lower to over 180 percent higher . by far , the largest component of these monetized-benefits is related to premature-mortality from long-term-exposure to particulate-matter ( $ 41 billion and $ 89 billion in 2010 and 2020 , respectively ) , followed by chronic-bronchitis ( $ 1.5 billion and $ 3.2 billion in 2010 and 2020 , respectively ) . to caps of 2.1 million tons in 2008 and 1.7 million tons in 2018 . mercury-emissions would be reduced by 69 percent , from current-emissions of 48 tons to caps of 26 tons in 2010 and 15 tons in 2018 . detailed-information on the costs of clear skies can be found in the clear skies act analytical-support package ( 2002 ) . in order to provide some insight into the potential-importance of the key-elements underlying-estimates of the benefits of reducing sox and nox-emissions , we developed an alternative-estimate using different-choices of data , methods , and assumptions that are detailed in section ii ( analytical approach ) . as indicated in exhibit 1 , the differences between the alternative and base estimates are found in the estimation of the impact of fine-particle reductions on premature-mortality and the valuation of reducing the risk of premature-mortality and the risk of chronic-bronchitis . the alternative-estimate of the impact of fine-particle reductions on premature-mortality relies on recent scientific studies finding an association between increased-mortality and short-term ( days to weeks ) exposure to particulate-matter , while the base estimate relies on a recent-reanalysis of earlier studies that found associations between long-term-exposure to fine-particles and increased-mortality . the alternative-approach also uses different-data to value-reductions in the risk of premature-mortality and chronic-bronchitis and makes adjustments relating to the health-status and potential-longevity of the populations most likely affected by pm . even using the more conservative-assumptions of this alternative , the benefits of clear skies still outweigh the projected costs of the proposal . all such benefit-estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties , which are discussed in section iii ( major-uncertainties in the benefits-analysis ) of this report . for example key-assumptions underlying the base and alternative-estimates for the mortality-category include the following : ( 1 ) inhalation of fine-particles is causally associated with premature-death at concentrations near those experienced by most americans on a daily basis . while biological-mechanisms for this effect have not yet been definitively established , the weight of the available epidemiological-evidence supports an assumption of causality . ( 2 ) all fine-particles , regardless of their chemical-composition , are equally-potent in causing premature-mortality . this is an important-assumption , because fine-particles from power-plant-emissions are chemically-different from directly emitted fine-particles from both mobile-sources and other industrial-facilities , but no clear scientific-grounds exist for supporting differential-effects estimates by particle-type . ( 3 ) the concentration-response-function for fine-particles is approximately-linear within the range of ambient-concentrations under consideration . thus , the estimates include health-benefits from reducing fine-particles in areas with varied concentrations of particulate-matter , including both regions that are in attainment with fine-particle-standard and those that do not meet the standard . ( 4 ) the forecasts for future-emissions and associated air-quality-modeling are valid . although recognizing the difficulties , assumptions and inherent-uncertainties in the overall-enterprise , these analyses are based on peer-reviewed scientific-literature and up-to-date-assessment-tools , and we believe the results are highly-useful in assessing this proposal . in addition to the quantified and monetized-benefits summarized above , there are a number of additional-categories are not currently-amenable to quantification or valuation . these include : the health and environmental-benefits of reducing-mercury accumulation in fish and other wildlife ; reduced acid and particulate-deposition-damage to cultural-monuments and other materials ; reduced ozone-effects on forested-ecosystems ; and environmental-benefits due to reductions of impacts of acidification in lakes and streams and eutrophication in coastal-areas . additionally , we have not quantified a number of known or suspected-health-effects linked with pm and ozone for which appropriate-concentration-response-functions are not available or which do not provide easily interpretable-outcomes ( i.e . changes in forced expiratory-volume ( fev1 ) ) . as a result , both the base and alternative monetized-benefits estimates underestimate the total-benefits attributable to the clear skies act . exhibit 1 summary of results : the estimated pm and ozone-related benefits of the clear skies act in 2010 and 20203 * results calculated using three percent-discount-rate as recommended by epa 's guidelines for economic-analysis ( us epa , 2000a ) . ** results calculated using seven percent-discount-rate as recommended by omb circular a-94 ( omb , 1992 ) . the two sets of estimates depicted in this table reflect alternative-assumptions and analytical-approaches regarding quantifying and evaluating the effects of airborne-particles on public health . all estimates assume that particles are causally associated with health-effects , and that all components have the same toxicity . linear-concentration-response-relationships between pm and all health-effects are assumed , indicating that reductions in pm have the same impact on health-outcomes regardless of the absolute-level of pm in a given location . the base estimate relies on estimates of the potential cumulative-effect of long-term-exposure to particles , while the alternative-estimate presumes that pm effects are limited to those that accumulate over much shorter time-periods . the alternative-estimate also uses different-approaches to value health-effects damages . all such estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties . it is of note that , based on recent preliminary-findings from the health-effects institute , the magnitude of mortality from short-tern-exposure ( alternative-estimate ) and hospital/er admissions estimates ( both estimates ) may be under or overestimated . ii . analytical approach the framework for the clear skies act benefits-analysis is the same as that used in three recent-state-of-the-art epa regulatory analyses : the section 812 prospective-analysis ( u.s. epa , 1999a ) ; the tier ii motor vehicle/gasoline sulfur rules regulatory-impact-analysis ( ria ) ( u.s. epa , 1999b ) ; and the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) . the analysis uses the same health-effect and valuation-functions employed in the most recent of these analyses , the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria . the analytical approach can be described as a sequence of six steps , summarized below and described in detail later in this report . these steps , listed in order of completion , are : 1 . scenario-development 2 . emissions-modeling 3 . air qua lity modeling 4 . human-health and visibility-effects-estimation 5 . economic-valuation 6 . adjustments for income-growth and benefits-aggregation exhibit 2 outlines the analytical-framework used to study the benefits of the clear skies act . the first step in the benefits-analysis is the specification of the regulatory-scenarios that will be evaluated . typically , an analysis will include a baseline-scenario that simulates future-conditions in the absence of the proposed regulation and one or more control-scenarios that simulate conditions under the regulations being evaluated . the benefits of a proposed regulation are then estimated as the difference in benefit outcomes ( e.g. , adverse-health-effects ) between the control and baseline-scenarios . for this analysis , the baseline-scenarios for 2010 and 2020 assume no additional emissions-control regulation beyond the continuing-effects of title iv of the clean-air act amendments , the nox sip-call , and other promulgated federal-rules issued under the clean-air act . for each year ( 2010 and 2020 ) , our analysis evaluates a single-control-scenario , as described below . after scenario-development , the second step of the benefits-analysis is the estimation of the effect of the clear skies act on emissions-sources . we generated-emissions-estimates for the baseline by projecting-changes in emissions under the baseline-case for 2010 and 2020 . we generated-emissions-estimates for the clear skies act control-scenario using the same set of economic activity projections as the baseline but with additional-emissions-controls consistent with the clear skies act caps . emissions-inputs were derived from the 1996 nti and the 1996 nei . in addition , emissions-inventories prepared for the heavy-duty diesel engine rulemaking were the basis for future-year emissions-projections . the integrated planning model ( ipm ) was used to derive all future-projections of electricity-generation source emissions . after the emissions-inventories are developed , they are translated into estimates of futureyear air-quality conditions under each scenario . we employed two sophisticated-computer-models , the regulatory modeling-system for aerosols and deposition ( remsad ) and the comprehensive air-quality-model with extensions ( camx ) to estimate-changes to the concentration of particulate-matter and ozone , respectively , resulting from the clear skies act . the remsad model was also used to estimate-changes in visibility associated with those changes in particulate-matter-concentrations and to estimate-changes in deposition of sulfur , nitrogen , and mercury . the air-quality-modeling results serve as inputs to a modeling-system that translates air-quality-changes to changes in health-outcomes ( e.g. , premature-mortality , emergency-room-visits ) through the use of concentration-response-functions . scientific-literature on the health-effects of air-pollutants provides the source of these concentration-response-functions . at this point , we derive estimates of the differences between the two scenarios in terms of incidences of a range of human-health-effects that are associated with exposure to ambient-particulate matter and ozone . in the next-step , we use economic-valuation-models or coefficients to estimate a dollar-value for the reduced incidence of those adverse-effects amenable to monetization . for example , analysis of estimates derived from the economic-literature provides an estimate of the value of reductions in mortality-risk . finally , we adjust the benefit-values for expected income-growth through 2010 and 2020 and aggregate the benefits to the appropriate geographic-level . as noted in section i ( introduction ) , we present base and alternative-estimates for mortality and chronic-bronchitis benefits . the different-methodologies and assumptions for these approaches are discussed in separate-subsections in the effects-estimation and valuation-sections below . exhibit 2 analytic-sequence for multi-emissions reduction proposal-benefits-analysis baseline and regulatory scenario-development this analysis looks at the impacts of the multi-pollutant reductions that are part of the clear skies act for two future target-years , 2010 and 2020 . avoided health-effects and visibility-improvements are quantified by comparing two scenarios : ( 1 ) a baseline-scenario ( base case ) that reflects the continuing-effects of title iv of the clean-air act amendments ( the acid-rain-program ) as well as other promulgated federal-rules issued under clean-air act authority that are expected to affect electric-generating-units ( egus ) and other sources of emissions ( e.g . the nox sip-call and the tier ii and heavy-duty diesel rules for mobile-sources ) . ( 2 ) a scenario that reflects full-implementation of the clear skies act in the target-year . emissions profile development emissions-inventories emission-inventories were developed to support the benefits-analysis fo r the clear skies act . emissions-profiles were generated for the following-cases : 1996 base-year , 2010 base case , 2010 clear skies , 2020 base case , and 2020 clear skies . these national-inventories were prepared for all 50 states at the county-level for mobile-highway and non-road-sources . they were prepared for the 48-contiguous-states at the countylevel for electric-generating-unit ( egu ) , non-egu point , and stationary-area sources . the approach used to create inventories was the same as that used for the heavy-duty engine ( hde ) rulemaking-analysis ( us epa , 2000d ) with modifications to reflect emission and modeling advances since that analysis.4 power-generation-emissions of sox and nox for each of the scenarios is presented in the clear skies act : technical-support package . exhibit 3 presents total national-emissions of nox and so2 from all sectors , including-power . this approach was documented and can be located at http : //www.epa.gov/otaq/hdmodels.htm . exhibit 3 national sox and nox-emissions projections for base and clear skies scenarios ( million tons ) the 1996 base-year inventory was used to project future-emissions under the base case and differences between the base case and the clear skies act . it was constructed using existing emissions-inventories created for various recent-rulemaking activities . for criteria-pollutants , the 1996 national-emissions inventory ( nei ) used for the heavy-duty diesel vehicle-rulemaking was used . for mercury , the 1996 national toxics inventory was modified based on the 1999 information-collection effort for coal utilities and the 2002 mact implementation for medical-waste incinerators , and the 2000 mact implementation for municipal-waste combustors was used . for the 2010 and 2020 base cases , emissions under current regulations with economic and population-growth were projected . the electric-utility-portion was developed using the integrated planning model ( ipm ) . ipm projects power-sector-emissions under title iv of the 1990 clean-air act amendments ( the acid-rain-program ) , which caps so2 emissions at 8.95 million tons/year beginning in 2010 . in addition , ipm 's projections for electric-utilities under the base case include the nox sip-call with a cap on summertime-nox-emissions in sip-call-states in 2004 ( based on 0.15 lb/mmbtu from 2001 ) and state-imposed nox caps in texas , connecticut , and missouri . this case also includes no controls on mercury-emissions from power-generation . the emissions-inventory for the base case also includes tier ii and heavy-duty diesel rules for mobile-sources . the uncertainty about how these mobile source rules will be implemented in the future contributes to uncertainty in both the base case and the clear skies act profile . the 2010 and 2020 clear skies act profile includes a 4.5 million ton/year cap on egus beginning in 2010 for so2 emissions , which will be lowered to a 3 million-ton-cap in 2018 ; a 2.1 million ton/yr cap beginning in 2008 for nox-emissions , which will be lowered to a 1.7 million-ton-cap in 2018 ; and a 26 ton/yr cap beginning in 2010 for mercury-emissions , which will be lowered to a 15-ton-cap in 2018 . because sources can reduce emissions early , earn allowances for these actions , and use the allowances later , actual-emissions are projected to be higher than the cap in the first years of each cap . the integrated planning model ( ipm ) the integrated planning model ( ipm ) predicts future-emissions outputs from egus affected by the clear skies act . these outputs are used to develop the emissions-inventories . ipm is a linear-programming-model of the electricity-sector that finds the most efficient ( i.e . least cost ) approach to operating the electric-power system over a given time period subjectto specific-constraints ( e.g . pollution caps or transmission-limitations ) . the model , which was developed for epa by icf resources , inc. , selects investment-strategies given the cost and performance-characteristics of available-options , forecasts of customer-demand for electricity , and reliability-criteria . system dispatch , which determines the proper and most efficient-use of the existing and new resources available to utilities and their customers , is optimized given the resource-mix , unit operating-characteristics , and fuel and other costs . unit and system operating-constraints provide system-specific-realism to the outputs of the model . the ipm is dynamic ; it has the capability to use forecasts of future-conditions , requirements , and option-characteristics to make decisions for the present . this ability replicates , to the extent possible , the perspective of utility-managers , regulatory personnel , and the public in reviewing important-investment-options for the utility-industry and electricity-consumers . decisions are made based on minimizing the net-present value of capital and operating costs over the full-planning-horizon . ipm also models a variety of environmental-market-mechanisms , such as emissions-caps , allowances , trading , and banking . 5 air-quality and deposition-modeling air-quality-modeling is a critical analytical-step that provides the link between emissions-changes and the physical-effects that affect human-health and the environment . this step of the analysis employs complex-computer-models that simulate the transport and transformation of emitted pollutants in the atmosphere . the results of these model-runs are predictions of pollutant-concentrations under each of the emission-control-scenarios specified above . these predicted concentrations are then used as inputs to the human-health effect estimation-model discussed in the next-section . air-quality-modelers face two key-challenges in attempting to translate emission-inventories into pollutant-concentrations . first , they must model the dispersion and transport of pollutants through the atmosphere . second , they must model pertinent atmospheric-chemistry and other pollutant-transformation and removal-processes . these challenges are particularly-difficult for those pollutants that are not emitted directly but instead form through secondary-processes . ozone is the best example ; it forms in the atmosphere through a series of complex , non-linear-chemical interactions of precursor-pollutants , particularly certain-classes of volatile organic-compounds ( vocs ) and nitrogen-oxides ( nox ) . modelers face similar-challenges when complete-documentation of the ipm model can be found athttp : //www.epa.gov/airmarkt/epa-ipm/index.html # documentation . estimating pm concentrations . atmospheric-transformation of gaseous-sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides to particulate sulfates and nitrates , respectively , contributes significantly to ambient-concentrations of fine particulate-matter . in addition to recognizing the complex atmospheric-chemistry relevant for some pollutants , air-quality-modelers also must deal with uncertainties associated with variable-meteorology and the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions . air-quality-modelers and researchers have responded to the need for scientifically-valid and reliable-estimates of air-quality-changes by developing a number of sophisticated atmospheric dispersion and transformation-models . some of these models have been employed in support of the development of federal clean-air-programs , national-assessment-studies , state-implementation-plans ( sips ) , and individual-air toxic source risk-assessments . in this analysis , we used two of these well-established-models , the regional-modeling-system for aerosols and deposition ( remsad ) and the comprehensive air-quality-model with extensions ( camx ) , to develop a picture of future-changes in air-quality resulting from the implementation of the clear skies act . regional-modeling-system for aerosols and deposition ( remsad ) the change in pm concentrations due to the clear skies act was modeled using the regional-modeling-system for aerosols and deposition ( remsad ) . remsad was also used to estimate the changes in visibility and deposition of mercury , nitrogen , and sulfur . remsad is a three-dimensional , grid-based eulerian-air-quality model designed to simulate long-term ( e.g. , annual ) concentrations and deposition-fluxes of atmospheric-pollutants over large-spatial scales ( e.g. , over the contiguous u.s. ) . air-pollution issues meant to be addressed by remsad include long-term pm2.5 ambient-concentrations ; visibility ; ambient-concentrations and deposition-fluxes of several hazardous-air-pollutants , including-mercury ; deposition-fluxes of nutrient-nitrogen ; and deposition of acids such as sulfuric-acid and nitric-acid . remsad has been developed under funding from the u.s. environmental-protection agency over the past five years . remsad consists of three components : ( 1 ) a meteorological-data pre-processor ; ( 2 ) the core-aerosol and toxic-deposition-model ( atdm ) ; and ( 3 ) postprocessing-programs . the horizontal-grid-size can be on the order of a few kilometers ( km ) for an urban-scale simulation up to about 100 km for a continental-scale-simulation . for large-scale-simulations , one-way-nesting of fine and coarse grids can be performed to allow simulation of sensitive-areas with strong-pollution spatial-gradients using a fine-grid-resolution . the vertical-structure of remsad covers the whole-troposphere from the surface up to about 15 km . the physical and chemical-processes simulated by remsad include emissions of pollutants from surface and elevated-sources , advective-transport , horizontal turbulent-diffusion , vertical mixing via turbulent-diffusion and convective transport , cloud-processes , gas-phase and aqueous-phase-chemistry , pm2.5 formation , dry-deposition and wet-deposition . version 6.40 of remsad was employed for this analysis . previous-versions of remsad have been used to estimate pm for epa 's heavy-duty engine diesel fuel rule and for the first section 812 prospective-analysis . remsad version 6.40 includes improvements that address-comments epa obtained during the 1999-peer-review of remsad version 4.1 ( seigneur et al. , 1999 ) , including improved-treatment of ammonium/nitrate/sulfate equilibrium , inclusion of additional aqueous sulfate formation pathways , and expanded-treatment of mercury-chemistry ( icf consulting , 2001 ) . the remsad modeling-domain selected for the clear skies act consists of 36 km x 36 km grid-cells covering the 48-contiguous united states , and remsad can perform a full-year-simulation , generating-predictions of hourly pm concentrations ( including both pm2.5 component-species and pm10 ) at each grid-cell . these hourly predictions form the basis for direct-calculation of daily and annual pm air-quality-metrics ( e.g. , annual-mean pm concentration ) as inputs to the health and welfare c-r functions of the benefits-analysis . remsad also gives visibility , which is used as an input into the visibility-damage-function . for this benefits-analysis , we applied remsad to the entire u.s. for four future-year-scenarios : a 2010 base case , a 2020 base case , a 2010 clear skies act case , and a 2020 clear skies act case . the difference in remsad-modeled pm concentrations for these scenarios represents the expected-change in pm due to the emission-controls under the clear skies act . comprehensive air-quality-model with extensions ( camx ) we modeled-changes in ozone in the eastern u.s. using the comprehensive air-quality-model with extensions ( camx ) . camx is an eulerian photochemical-dispersion-model designed to assess both gaseous and particulate-air-pollution over many scales , from urban to super-regional . the model estimates concentrations of both inert and chemically reactive-pollutants by simulating the physical and chemical-processes in the atmosphere that affect ozone-formation . the latest version of the model , camx 3.10 , provides full-support for parallel-processing for increased computational-performance , as well as new algorithms for gas-phase-chemistry ( camx v3.10 user's guide , april 2002 ) . the modeling-domain for this analysis encompasses most of the eastern u.s. , bounded on the east by the 67 degrees west-longitude and on the west by the 99 degrees west-longitude . ozone-modeling is only done for the east because there is very little-confidence in the application of this model to the west . the horizontal-resolution for the outer-grid is approximately 36 km . the horizontal-resolution for the inner-grid is approximately 12 km . the vertical-resolution for both grids consists of nine layers . the top of the modeling-domain is 4000 meters above ground-level . recognizing the relationship between grid-cell-resolution and the certainty of results , we sought to estimate pollutant-concentrations in more populated-areas using higher resolution models . similarly , we used an intermediate-resolution-grid ( 12 km x 12 km ) to model ozone in `` inner-otag '' states where population-density is high and ozone-transport is a major problem.6 this approach makes camx well suited to estimate effects based on a range of ozone averaging-times , an important-capability for benefits-assessment-applications . this study extracted hourly , surface-layer-ozone-concentrations for each grid-cell from the standard camx-output-file containing hourly average-ozone-values . these model-predictions are used in conjunction with the observed-concentrations obtained from the aerometric 6 the ozone-transport assessment group ( otag ) consists of the 37 easternmost-states and the district of columbia . the `` inner-otag '' region is comprised of the more eastern ( and more populated ) states within the otag domain . information retrieval system ( airs ) to generate ozone-concentrations for the entire-ozone-season . 7,8 the predicted changes in ozone-concentrations from the base case to the clear skies act serve as inputs to the health and welfare c-r functions of the benefits-analysis , i.e. , the criteria air-pollutant modeling-system ( capms ) . in order to estimate ozone-related-health and welfare-effects for the eastern u.s. , fullseason-ozone-data are required for every capms grid-cell . given available ozone monitoring-data , we generated full-season-ozone-profiles for each location in the modeling-domain in two steps : ( 1 ) we combine monitored observations and modeled ozone-predictions to interpolate hourly-ozone concentrations to a grid of 8 km by 8 km-population-grid-cells , as will be described in the human-health and environmental-effects-modeling section , and ( 2 ) we converted these full-season hourly-ozone profiles to an ozone-measure of interest , such as the daily average . 9 , 10 for the analysis of ozone-impacts on agriculture , we use a similar-approach except air-quality is interpolated to county centroids as opposed to population-grid-cells . we report ozone-concentrations as a cumulative-index called the sum06 . the sum06 is the sum of the ozone-concentrations for every hour that exceeds 0.06 parts per million ( ppm ) within a 12-hour period from 8 am to 8 pm in the months of may to september . these methods are described in detail in the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( usepa , 2000b ) . human-health and environmental-effects-modeling as part of the evaluation of the effects of various-scenarios concerning so2 and nox-emissions , we have identified and , where possible , developed-quantitative , monetized-estimates of these health-benefits . this section describes the first step in this process , the estimation of changes in the incidence of adverse-health-effects . our analysis also looked at several environmental endpoints , including the benefits associated with visibility-improvements , ozone-damage to agriculture , and changes in acidification in lakes and streams in the east . exhibit 4 provides a list of the health-effects for which we estimate quantified-benefits as part of our analysis plus a list of the health-effects for which we are unable to quantify benefits at this time . the unquantified-benefits for ozone and pm fall into two categories : ( 1 ) those for which the scientific-literature does not provide an established-concentration-response ( c-r ) function capable of estimating-health-effects with reasonable-certainty and ( 2 ) those effects that may double-count benefits ( e.g. , hospital-admissions for specific cardiovascular-illnesses ) . the direct health-effects of nitrogen-oxide gases and sulfur-dioxide-gases are also unquantified . although c-r functions are available to estimate health-effects of exposure to nitrogen-oxides 7 the ozone-season for this analysis is defined as the 5-month period from may to september ; however , to estimate certain-crop yield-benefits , the modeling-results were extended to include months outside the 5-month ozone-season . 8 based on airs , there were 949 ozone-monitors with sufficient-data , i.e. , at least 9 hourly-observations per day ( 8 am to 8 pm ) in a given season . 9 the 8 km-grid-squares contain the population-data used in the health-benefits analysis model , capms . see section c of this chapter for a discussion of this model . 10 this approach is a generalization of planar-interpolation that is technically referred to as enhanced-voronoi-neighbor averaging ( evna ) spatial-interpolation ( see abt associates ( 2000 ) for a more detailed-description ) . and sulfur-dioxide-gases , these effects were not estimated in this analysis because of modeling and resource-limitations . the health and environmental-effects of mercury-exposure are also not quantified . epa is currently investigating-methods to quantify and monetize the human-health related-benefits of reductions in air-emissions of mercury . however , there are still major-gaps in the science of mercury-fate , transport , and transformation that make such an assessment difficult at time . methods for mercury-benefits analyses are still under development and do not yet provide a means to estimate the mercury-related-benefits of the clear skies act . exhibit 4

impacts to commercial , subsistence , and recreational-fishing reduced-existence-value and option-values for ecosystems without accumulated mercury ( e.g . biodiversity values ) to estimate health-benefits from the clear skies act , we used the same general-approach used in recent major oar regulatory analyses ( u.s. epa , 1999a , 1999b and 2000b ) . this approach takes the estimates of changes in ambient-pollutant-concentrations predicted by air-quality-modeling for each scenario ( relative to the baseline-scenario ) and converts them into estimates of changes in the incidence of adverse-health-effects using concentration-response ( c-r ) functions . the model we use to generate these estimates is the criteria air-pollutant modeling-system ( capms ) . we calculated the benefits attributable to the clear skies act as the change in incidence of adverse-health-effects between the control and baseline-scenarios . capms estimates incidence-changes for each health-effect within 8 km x 8 km grid-cells covering the contiguous u.s. and generates national health-benefits estimates by summing the annual-incidence-changefor each effect across all grid-cells . capms uses c-r functions specific to each health-effect to calculate incidences in each grid-cell . c-r functions are equations that relate the change in the number of individuals in a population exhibiting a `` response '' ( in this case an adverse-health-effect such as respiratory-disease ) to a change in pollutant-concentration experienced by that population . in general , the c-r functions used in capms require four input-values : ( 1 ) the grid-cell-specific change in pollutant-concentration ; ( 2 ) the grid-cell affected-population ( i.e . asthmatic-children ) ; ( 3 ) the baseline-incidence-rate of the health-effects ; and ( 4 ) an estimate of the change in the number of individuals that suffer an adverse-health-effect per unit-change in air-quality . both the form of the c-r function and the fourth-input-value are derived from epidemiological-studies in the scientific-literature that link pollutant-exposures with adverse-health-effects . in addition to our national-benefits-results , we generated regional-estimates of the benefits of the clear skies act using the same benefits estimation-procedure used to generate the national estimates . the remsad and camx air-quality-models provide information on the improvements in ambient-air-concentrations throughout the country within 36 km by 36 km gridboxes . this information is used in subsequent-exposure , dose-response , and valuation-steps , including location-specific-baseline-mortality and morbidity-risk-data to generate locationspecific-estimates of health-benefits . this `` bottom-up '' approach provides a more accurate-representation of regional-benefits estimates than a comparable '' top-down '' , emissions-weighted-approach might , particularly given the importance of long-range-transport for the major-pollutants controlled by the clear skies act ( so2 and nox , as well as mercury ) . recreational-visibility-benefits can also be geographically disaggregated , based on either the location of the recreational class i area where visibility is improved , or on the state of origin of visitors to these sites . for this analysis , we disaggregated-benefits based on the state of origin of visitors , reflecting the notion that many of the recreational-sites with the highest visitation-rates are valued by individuals throughout the country , not only by those individuals who live closest to the site . the results of the regional-analysis of visibility-benefits indicate that benefits are realized throughout the country , with a higher concentration of benefits in those areas of higher population-density . exhibit 6 provides a list of the health-effect-endpoints we quantified as part of our analysis of the clear skies act , as well as references to the studies that serve as the basis for the c-r functions . as with emissions and air-quality-estimates , our estimates of the effect of ambient-pollution-levels on all of these endpoints represent the best science and analytical-tools available . with the exception of the short-term-mortality-endpoint , the choice of c-r functions and the majority of the analytical-assumptions used to develop our estimates have been reviewed and approved by epa 's science advisory-board ( sab ) . the c-r functions in exhibit 6 only capture effects related to exposures to particulate-matter and ozone ; they do not include human-health-effects related to exposures to so2 , no2 , or mercury . as a result , for these exposures , we have underestimated the total-health benefits attributable to clear skies-emissions-reductions . air-quality-changes as in the analysis of the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel rule ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) , the remsad pm and camx ozone-results discussed above served as direct-inputs to the capms model . to calculate population-exposure to pm , each 8 km by 8 km capms grid-cell was assigned to the nearest remsad grid-cell by calculating the shortest distance between the center of the capms grid-cell to the center of a remsad grid-cell . to develop baseline and control-exposure-predictions for ozone , we used the results of the variable-grid comprehensive air-quality-model with extensions ( camx ) for each scenario and observed-ozone data for the baseline-year ( 1996 ) . at each ozone-monitor , we quantified the relationship between camx modeled levels of ozone at the monitor for 1996 and the future-year ( 2010 or 2020 ) . these adjustment-ratios are applied to the actual-monitoring-data to generate estimates of ozone-levels at the monitor for the future scenarios . note that we do not use the modeling-data directly to estimate future-year-ozone-levels . instead , we use them in a relative-sense to simply adjust actual , 1996 ozone-monitor levels to future base case or clear skies levels . this provides a better estimate than the camx-modeling-data itself . to calculate population-exposure to ozone , each capms grid-cell was assigned a distance-weighted-average of adjusted ozone-levels from nearby ozone-monitors . population-health benefits are related to the change in air-pollutant exposure experienced by individuals ; because the expected-changes in pollutant-concentrations vary from location to location , individuals in different-parts of the country may not experience the same level of health-benefits . we apportioned-benefits among individuals by matching the change in air-pollutant-concentration in each grid-cell with the size of the population that experiences that change . we extrapolated grid-cell population estimates for future-years from 1990 u.s. census-bureau data according to the method described in u.s. epa ( 2000b ) . asthma-attacks pm and whittemore and korn ( 1980 ) asthmatics , all

( daily-mortality-studies examine the impact of pm2.5 on mortality on a single day or over the average of several days ) . study-period-studies examining a relatively longer period of time ( and therefore having more data ) are preferred , because they have greater statistical-power to detect effects . more recent-studies are also preferred because of possible-changes in pollution mixes , medical care , and life-style over time . study-population studies examining a relatively-large sample are preferred . studies of narrow-population-groups are generally disfavored , although this does not exclude the possibility of studying populations that are potentially more sensitive to pollutants ( e.g. , asthmatics , children , elderly ) . however , there are tradeoffs to comprehensiveness of study-population . selecting a c-r function from a study that considered all ages will avoid omitting the benefits associated with any population-age-category . however , if the age-distribution of a study-population from an `` all population '' study is different from the age-distribution in the assessment population , and if pollutant-effects vary by age , then bias can be introduced into the benefits-analysis . study-location u.s. studies are more desirable than non-u.s. studies because of potential-differences in pollution characteristics , exposure-patterns , medical-care-system , and life-style . pollutants included in model-models with more pollutants are generally preferred to models with fewer pollutants , though careful-attention must be paid to potential-colinearity between pollutants . because pm has been acknowledged to be an important and pervasive pollutant , models that include some measure of pm are highly preferred to those that do not . measure of pm pm2.5 and pm10 are preferred to other measures of particulate-matter , such as total suspended particulate-matter ( tsp ) , coefficient of haze ( coh ) , or black-smoke ( bs ) based on evidence that pm2.5 and pm10 are more directly correlated with adverse-health-effects than are these other measures of pm . economically valuable-health some health-effects , such as forced expiratory-volume and other technical-measurements of effects-lung function , are difficult to value in monetary-terms . these health-effects are not quantified in this analysis . non-overlapping-endpoints although the benefits associated with each individual-health-endpoint may be analyzed separately , care must be exercised in selecting-health-endpoints to include in the overall-benefits-analysis because of the possibility of double-counting of benefits . including emergency-room-visits in a benefits-analysis that already considers hospital-admissions , for example , will result in double-counting of some benefits if the category '' hospital-admissions '' includes emergency-room-visits . concentration-response-relationships between a pollutant and a given health-endpoint are applied consistently across all locations nationwide . this applies to both c-r relationships defined by a single c-r function and those defined by a pooling of multiple c-r functions . although the c-r relationship may , in fact , vary from one location to another ( for example , due to differences in population-susceptibilities or differences in the composition of pm ) , locationspecific c-r functions are generally not available . a single-function applied everywhere may result in overestimates of incidence-changes in some locations and underestimates elsewhere , but these location-specific-biases will negate each other , to some extent , when the total-incidence-change is calculated . it is not possible to know the extent or direction of the bias in the total-incidence-change based on the general-application of a single c-r function everywhere . c-r functions may also be estimated with or without explicit thresholds . air-pollution levels below the threshold for each health-effect studied are assumed not to cause the effect . when no threshold is assumed , as is often the case in epidemiological-studies , any exposure-level is assumed to pose a non-zero-risk of response to at least one segment of the population . in the benefits-analyses for some recent-rias ( e.g. , the regional-haze ria and the nox sip-call ria ) , the low-end-estimate of benefits assumed a threshold in pm health-effects at 15 : g/m3 . however , the sab , supported by recent-literature addressing this issue ( rossi et al. , 1999 ; schwartz , 2000 ) , subsequently advised epa that there is currently no scientific-basis for selecting a threshold of 15 : g/m3 or any other specific-threshold for the pm-related-health-effects considered in this analysis ( epa-sab-council-adv-99-012 , 1999 ) . therefore , for our benefits-analysis , we assume there are no thresholds for modeling-health-effects . we do , however , present a quantitative-sensitivity-analysis of this assumption in the results section . recently , the health-effects institute ( hei ) reported-findings by investigators at johns hopkins university and others that have raised-concerns about aspects of the statistical-methods used in a number of recent-time-series-studies of short-term-exposures to air-pollution and health-effects ( greenbaum , 2002a ) . some of the concentration-response-functions used in this benefits-analysis were derived from such short-term-studies . the estimates derived from the long-term-exposure-studies , which account for a major share of the benefits in the base estimate , are not affected . as discussed in hei materials provided to sponsors and to the clean-air scientific advisory-committee ( greenbaum , 2002a , 2002b ) , these investigators found problems in the default `` convergence-criteria '' used in generalized additive-models ( gam ) and a separate-issue first identified by canadian-investigators about the potential to underestimate standard-errors in the same statistical package.11 these and other investigators have begun to reanalyze the results of several important time-series-studies with alternative-approaches that address these issues and have found a downward revision of some results . for example , the mortality-risk-estimates for short-term-exposure to pm10 from nmmaps were overestimated ( this study was not used in this benefits-analysis of fine-particle effects ) .12 however , both the relative-magnitude and the direction of bias introduced by the convergence-issue are case-specific . in most cases , the concentration-response-relationship may be overestimated ; in other cases , it may be underestimated . the preliminary-reanalyses of the mortality and morbidity-components of nmmaps suggest that analyses reporting the lowest relative-risks appear to be affected more greatly by this error than studies reporting higher relative-risks ( dominici et al. , 2002 ; schwartz and zanobetti , 2002 ) . 11most of the studies used a statistical-package known as '' s-plus . '' for further details , see http : //www.healtheffects.org/pubs/nmmapsletter.pdf . 12hei sponsored the multi-city the national morbidity , mortality , and air-pollution study ( nmmaps ) . see http : //biosun01.biostat.jhsph.edu/~fdominic/nmmaps/nmmaps-revised.pdf for revised mortality-results . our examination of the original-studies used in this analysis finds that the health-endpoints that are potentially affected by the gam issues include : reduced-hospital-admissions in both the base and alternative-estimates ; reduced lower respiratory-symptoms in the both the base and alternative-estimates ; and reduced premature-mortality due to short-term pm exposures in the alternative-estimate . while resolution of these issues is likely to take some time , the preliminary-results from ongoing-reanalyses of some of the studies used in our clear-skies-analyses ( dominici et al , 2002 ; schwartz and zanobetti , 2002 ; schwartz , personal-communication 2002 ) suggest a more modest-effect of the s-plus error than reported for the nmmaps pm10 mortality-study . while we wait for further clarification from the scientific-community , we have chosen not to remove these results from the clear skies benefits-estimates , nor have we elected to apply any interim adjustment-factor based on the preliminary-reanalyses . epa will continue to monitor the progress of this concern , and make appropriate-adjustments as further information is made available . premature-mortality ( particulate-matter ) both long and short-term-exposures to ambient-levels of air-pollution have been associated with increased risk of premature-mortality . the size of the mortality-risk-estimates from these epidemiological-studies , the serious-nature of the effect itself , and the high monetary-value ascribed to prolonging-life make mortality-risk-reduction the most important-health-endpoint quantified in this analysis . because of the importance of this endpoint and the considerable-uncertainty among economists and policymakers as to the appropriate way to value-reductions in mortality-risks , this section discusses some of the issues surrounding the estimation of premature-mortality . additional discussion is found in the section on uncertainties . health researchers have consistently linked air-pollution , especially pm , with excess-mortality . although a number of uncertainties remain to be addressed by continued-research ( nrc , 1998 ) , a substantial-body of published scientific-literature recognizes a correlation between elevated pm concentrations and increased-mortality-rates . two types of community-epidemiological studies ( involving-measures of short-term and long-term-exposures and response ) have been used to estimate pm/ mortality relationships . short-term-studies relate shortterm ( often day-to-day ) changes in pm concentrations and changes in daily-mortality rates up to several days after a period of elevated pm concentrations . long-term-studies examine the potential relationship between longer-term ( e.g. , one or more years ) exposure to pm and annual-mortality-rates . researchers have found significant-associations using both types of studies . 1 . base estimate over a dozen-studies have found significant-associations between various-measures of long-term-exposure to pm and elevated-rates of annual-mortality ( e.g . lave and seskin , 1977 ; ozkaynak and thurston , 1987 ) . while most of the published studies found positive ( but not always-significant ) associations with available pm indices such as total suspended particles ( tsp ) , fine-particles-components ( i.e . sulfates ) , and fine-particles , exploration of alternative model-specifications sometimes found inconsistencies ( e.g . lipfert , 1989 ) . these early `` crosssectional '' studies were criticized for a number of methodological-limitations , particularly for inadequate control at the individual-level for variables that are potentially important in causing-mortality , such as wealth , smoking , and diet . more recently , several new , long-term-studies have been published that use improved-approaches and appear to be consistent with the earlier body of literature . these new `` prospective-cohort '' studies reflect a significant-improvement over the earlier work because they include information on individual-information with respect to measures related to health-status and residence . the most extensive study and analyses has been based on data from two prospective-cohort groups , often referred to as the harvard `` six-city study '' ( dockery et al. , 1993 ) and the `` american cancer society or acs study '' ( pope et al. , 1995 ) ; these studies have found consistent relationships between fine-particle-indicators and mortality across multiple-locations in the u.s. a third major-data-set comes from the california based 7th-day adventist-study ( e.g . abbey et al , 1999 ) , which reported-associations between long-term pm exposure and mortality in men . results from this cohort , however , have been inconsistent and the air-quality-results are not geographically representative of most of the us . more recently , a cohort of adult male-veterans diagnosed with hypertension has been examined ( lipfert et al. , 2000 ) . unlike previous-long-term-analyses , this study found some associations between mortality and ozone but found inconsistent-results for pm indicators . given their consistent-results and broad-applicability to general us populations , the six-city and acs data have been of particular-importance in benefits-analyses . the credibility of these two studies is further enhanced by the fact that they were subject to extensive-reexamination and reanalysis by an independent scientific-analysis-team of experts compiled by the health-effects institute ( krewski et al. , 2000 ) . the final-results of the reanalysis were then independently peer reviewed by a special panel of the hei health review committee . the results of these reanalyses confirmed and expanded those of the original-investigators . this intensive independent reanalysis-effort was occasioned both by the importance of the original-findings as well as concerns that the underlying individual health-effects information has never been made publicly-available . the hei re-examination lends credibility to the original-studies but also found unexpected-sensitivities concerning ( a ) which pollutants are most important , ( b ) the role of education in mediating the association between pollution and mortality , and ( c ) the magnitude of the association depending on how spatial-correlation was handled . further confirmation and extension of the overall-findings using more recent-air-quality and acs health-information was recently published in the journal of the american medical association ( pope et al. , 2002 ) . in general , the risk-estimates based on the long-term-mortality-studies are substantially greater than those derived from short-term-studies . in developing and improving the methods for estimating and valuing the potential-reductions in mortality-risk over the years , epa has consulted with a panel of the science advisory-board . that panel recommended-use of long-term prospective-cohort-studies in estimating mortality-risk-reduction ( epa-sab-council-adv-99-005 , 1999 ) . more specifically , the sab recommended-emphasis on pope , et al . ( 1995 ) because it includes a much larger sample-size and longer exposure-interval , and covers more locations ( e.g . 50 cities compared to 6 cities examined in the harvard data ) than other studies of its kind . as explained in the regulatory-impact-analysis for the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel rule ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) , more recent epa benefits-analyses have relied on an improved specification from this data-set that was developed in the hei reanalysis of this study ( krewski et al. , 2000 ) . the particular specification estimated a c-r function based on changes in mean levels of pm2.5 , as opposed to the function in the original-study , which used median-levels . this specification also includes a broader geographic-scope than the original-study ( 63 cities versus 50 ) . the sab has recently agreed with epa 's selection of this specification for use in analyzing-mortality-benefits of pm reductions ( epa-sab-council-adv-01-004 , 2001 ) . for these reasons , the present-analysis uses the same concentration-response-function in developing the base estimate of mortality-benefits . 2 . alternative-estimate to reflect concerns about the inherent-limitations in the number of studies supporting a causal-association between long-term-exposure and mortality , an alternative benefit-estimate was derived from the large number of time-series-studies that have established a likely causal-relationship between short-term-measures of pm and daily-mortality-statistics . a particular-strength of such studies is the fact that potential confounding-variables such as socio-economic-status , occupation , and smoking do not vary on a day-to-day-basis in an individual-area . a number of multi-city and other types of studies strongly suggest that these effects-relationships can not be explained by weather , statistical approaches , or other pollutants . the risk-estimates from the vast majority of the short-term-studies include the effects of only one or two-day-exposure to air-pollution . more recently , several-studies have found that the practice of examining the effects on a single-day-basis may significantly understate the risk of short-term-exposures ( schwartz , 2000 ; zanobetti et al , 2002 ) . these studies suggest that the short-term-risk can double when the single-day-effects are combined with the cumulative-impact of exposures over multiple-days to weeks prior to a mortality event . the fact that the pm-mortality-coefficients from the cohort-studies are far larger than the coefficients derived from the daily time-series-studies provides some evidence for an independent chronic-effect of pm pollution on health . indeed , the base estimate presumes that the larger coefficients represent a more complete accounting of mortality-effects , including both the cumulative total of short-term-mortality as well as an additional-chronic effect . this is , however , not the only possible-interpretation of the disparity . various-reviewers have argued that 1 ) the long-term estimates may be biased high and/or 2 ) the short-term-estimates may be biased low . in this view , the two study-types could be measuring the same underlying-relationship . reviewers have noted some possible-sources of upward-bias in the long-term-studies . some have noted that the less robust-estimates based on the six-cities study are significantly higher than those based on the more broadly distributed acs data-sets . some reviewers have also noted that the observed-mortality-associations from the 1980 's and 90 's may reflect higher pollution-exposures from the 1950 's to 1960 's . while this would bias-estimates based on more recent pollution-levels upwards , it also would imply a truly long-term chronic-effect of pollution . with regard to possible-sources of downward-bias , it is of note that the recent-studies suggest that the single day time-series-studies may understate the short-term-effect on the order of a factor of two . these considerations provide a basis for considering an alternative-estimate using the most recent-estimates from the wealth of time-series-studies , in addition to one based on the long-term-cohort-studies . in essence , the alternative-estimate addresses the above noted uncertainties about the relationship between premature-mortality and long-term-exposures to ambient-levels of fine-particles by assuming that there is no mortality-effect of chronic-exposures to fine-particles . instead , it assumes that the full-impact of fine-particles on premature-mortality can be captured using a concentration-response-function relating daily-mortality to short-term fine-particle-levels . specifically , a concentration-response-function based on schwartz et al . ( 1996 ) is employed , with an adjustment to account for recent-evidence that daily-mortality is associated with particle-levels from a number of previous-days ( schwartz , 2000 ) . previous daily-mortality-studies ( schwartz et al. , 1996 ) examined the impact of pm2.5 on mortality on a single day or over the average of two or more days . recent analyses have found that impacts of elevated pm2.5 on a given day can elevate mortality on a number of following-days ( schwartz , 2000 ; samet et al. , 2000 ) . multi-day-models are often referred to as `` distributed-lag '' models because they assume that mortality following a pm event will be distributed over a number of days following or `` lagging '' the pm event . 13 there are no pm2.5 daily-mortality-studies which report numeric estimates of relative-risks from distributed-lag models ; only pm10 studies are available . daily-mortality c-r functions for pm10 are consistently lower in magnitude than pm2.5-mortality c-r functions , because fine-particles are believed to be more closely associated with mortality than the coarse-fraction of pm . given that the emissions-reductions under the clear skies act result primarily in reduced ambient-concentrations of pm2.5 , use of a pm10 based c-r function-results in a significant downward-bias in the estimated reductions in mortality . to account for the full-potential multi-day-mortality-impact of acute pm2.5 events , we use the distributed-lag model for pm10 reported in schwartz ( 2000 ) to develop an adjustment-factor which we then apply to the pm2.5 based c-r function reported in schwartz et al . ( 1996 ) . if most of the increase in mortality is expected to be associated with the fine-fraction of pm10 , then it is reasonable to assume that the same proportional-increase in risk would be observed if a distributed-lag model were applied to the pm2.5 data . the distributed-lag adjustment-factor is constructed as the ratio of the estimated-coefficient from the unconstrained distributed-lag model to the estimated-coefficient from the single-lag-model reported in schwartz ( 2000 ) . the unconstrained distributed-lag model coefficient-estimate is 0.0012818 and the single-lag-model coefficient-estimate is 0.0006479 . the ratio of these estimates is 1.9784 . this adjustment-factor is then multiplied by the estimated coefficients from the schwartz et al . ( 1996 ) study . there are two relevant-coefficients from the schwartz et al . ( 1996 ) study , one corresponding to all-cause-mortality , and one corresponding to chronic obstructive pulmonary-disease ( copd ) mortality ( separation by cause is necessary to implement the life-years lost-approach detailed below ) . the adjusted-estimates for these two c-r functions are : all-cause-mortality = 0.001489 * 1.9784 = 0.002946 copd mortality = 0.003246 * 1.9784 = 0.006422 note that these estimates , while approximating the full-impact of daily-pollution-levels on daily-death-counts , do not capture any impacts of long-term-exposure to air-pollution . as discussed earlier , epa 's science advisory-board , while acknowledging the uncertainties in estimation of a pm-mortality-relationship , has repeatedly recommended the use of a study that 13 as discussed above , based on recent preliminary-findings from the health-effects institute , the magnitude of mortality from shorttern-exposure ( alternative-estimate ) and hospital/er admissions estimates ( both estimates ) may be either under or overestimated by an uncertain-amount . does reflect the impacts of long-term-exposure . the omission of long-term-impacts accounts for approximately 40-percent-reduction in the estimate of avoided premature-mortality in the alternative-estimate relative to the base estimate . chronic-bronchitis chronic-bronchitis is characterized by mucus in the lungs and a persistent wet-cough for at least three months a year for several years in a row . chronic-bronchitis affects an estimated five percent of the u.s. population ( american lung association , 1999 ) . a limited-number of studies have estimated the impact of air-pollution on new incidences of chronic-bronchitis . schwartz ( 1993 ) and abbey , et al . ( 1995 ) provide evidence that long-term pm exposure leads to the development of chronic-bronchitis in the u.s . following the same approaches of the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) and the section 812 prospective report ( us epa , 1999a ) , this analysis pooled-estimates from these two studies to develop a c-r function linking pm to chronic-bronchitis . the schwartz ( 1993 ) study examined the relationship between exposure to pm10 and prevalence of chronic-bronchitis . the abbey , et al . ( 1995 ) study examined the relationship between pm2.5 and new incidences of chronic-bronchitis . both studies have strengths and weaknesses , which suggest that pooling the effect estimates from each study , may provide a better estimate of the expected-change in incidences of chronic-bronchitis than using-either-study alone . it should be noted that schwartz used-data on the prevalence of chronic-bronchitis , not its incidence . following the approach of the section 812 prospective report , we estimated the percentage-change in the prevalence-rate for chronic-bronchitis using the estimated-coefficient from schwartz 's study in a c-r function , and then applied this percentage-change to a baseline-incidence-rate obtained from another source . for example , if the prevalence declines by 25 percent with a drop in pm , then baseline-incidence drops by 25 percent with the same drop in pm . visibility-benefits as the name chosen for the clear skies act implies , one of the direct-consequences of the reductions in fine-particles that accompany-implementation of the so2 and nox-emissions caps is an improvement in atmospheric-clarity and visibility . changes in the emissions of so2 and nox caused by the clear skies act will change the level of visibility in much of the u.s by reducing concentrations of sulfate and nitrate-particles . fine-particles absorb and scatter-light , impairing-visibility . visibility directly affects people 's enjoyment of a variety of daily-activities both in the places they live and work and in the places they travel to for recreation . the clean-air act recognizes visibility as an important public-good in naming-visibility as one of the aspects of public-welfare to be protected in setting secondary-naaqs . in sections 165 and 169 , the act places particular-value on protecting-visibility in 156 national-parks and wilderness-areas ( e.g . shenandoah , acadia , and grand canyon ) that are termed class i federal-areas . as noted above , the remsad modeling estimates regional and national visibility-improvements associated with clear skies . as discussed in a subsequent-section , this analysis also provides partial estimates of the potential economic-value of these visibility-improvements . a number of related-measures can be used to measure changes in visibility associated with reduced fine-particle-concentrations . a key such measure is light `` extinction , '' a measure of the amount of light scattered and absorbed by particles suspended in air . this light-scattering and absorption reduces atmospheric-clarity and is perceived as haze . changes in fine particulate-mass-components are used directly to estimate-changes in extinction . decreasing extinction ( in units of inverse-distance ) can in turn be used to estimate quantitative-measures more directly related to human-perception such as contrast of distant-targets and visual-range . more recently , sisler ( 1996 ) created a unitless-measure of visibility based directly on the degree of measured light absorption called the deciview . deciviews , like the analagous-term decibel , employ a logarithmic-scale to evaluate relative-changes in visibility that is more directly related to human-perception . sisler characterized a change in light-extinction of one deciview as `` a small but perceptible scenic-change under many circumstances . '' for this analysis , remsad version 6.40 was used to predict the change in visibility , measured in deciviews and presented graphically , of the areas affected by the clear skies act . economic-valuation of benefits the overall-approach applied in our estimates of the benefits of the clear skies act closely parallels that used in prior epa analyses , including the section 812 series of reports to congress ( u.s. epa , 1996 and 1999 ) and the recent heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) . as in those analyses , the epa has not conducted extensive new primary-research to measure economic-benefits for individual-rulemakings . as a result , our estimates are based on the best-available methods of benefits-transfer . benefits-transfer is the science and art of adapting primary-benefits research from similar-contexts to obtain the most accurate-measure of benefits for the environmental-quality-change under analysis . where appropriate , we have made adjustments to existing-primary research for the level of environmental-quality-change , the sociodemographic and economic-characteristics of the affected-population , and other factors in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of benefits-estimates . in general , economists tend to view an individual's willingness-to-pay ( wtp ) for an improvement in environmental-quality as the most complete and appropriate-measure of the value of an environmental or health-risk-reduction . an individual's willingness-to-accept ( wta ) compensation for not receiving the improvement is also a valid-measure . willingness to pay and willingness to accept are comparable-measures when the change in environmental-quality is small and there are reasonably-close substitutes available . however , wtp is generally considered to be a more readily-measurable and conservative-measure of benefits . adoption of wtp as the measure of value implies that the value of environmental-quality-improvements is dependent on the individual preferences of the affected-population and that the existing distribution of income ( ability to pay ) is appropriate . our analysis relies on up-to-date-reviews of the relevant resource-economics literature that provides wtp values for health-risk reductions and visibility-improvements similar to those that will be provided by implementation of the clear skies act . exhibit 8 provides a summary of the base wtp values used to generate estimates of the economic-value of avoided health-effects for this analysis , adjusted to 1999 dollars , and a brief-description of the basis for these values . exhibit 9 provides a summary of the monetary-values for the alternative-estimate used for economic-valuation of mortality and chronic-bronchitis . for these two endpoints , the alternative-estimate valuation differs from the base estimate values . in the sections that follow , we discuss in greater detail the basis for generating wtp for premature-mortality-risk reductions and wtp for reductions in the risk of contracting-chronic bronchitis and the basis for making-adjustments to unit-values to make them more applicable to the air-pollution-reductions we anticipate from the clear skies act . the mortality and chronic-bronchitis health-endpoints are the most influential in our estimation of monetized-benefits , because they account for over 95 percent of the total estimated monetized-benefits of the clear skies act . in addition , we provide a brief-summary of our approach to valuing-visibility and agricultural-yield-improvements . detailed-descriptions of the basis for other economic-valuation-methods can be found in chapter vii of epa 's heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) . exhibit 8-unit-values used for

( 1986 ) . ( mrads ) 1 this value does not reflect the 5-year lag-adjustment and the adjustment for changes in real-income over time that are included in the mortality-valuation in our national-benefits-summaries . the lag-adjustment distributes the mortality-incidence over five years ( 25 percent in each of the first two years , and 17 percent for each of the remaining-years ) and discounts-mortality-benefits over this period at a rate of three percent . the adjustment to the mortality unit-valuation for growth in real-income in 2020 is achieved using an adjustment-factor of 1.278.2 this value does not reflect the adjustment for changes in real-income over time that is included in the chronic-bronchitis valuation in our national-benefits-summaries . the adjustment to the chronic-bronchitis unit-valuation for growth in real-income in 2020 is achieved using an adjustment-factor of 1.319 . 3 these values do not reflect the adjustment for changes in real-income over time that is included in the benefit valuations in our national-benefits-summaries . the adjustment to the unit-valuations of these endpoints for growth in real-income in 2020 is achieved using an adjustment-factor of 1.089 . 4 the value of a work-loss day presented here represents the national-median . the valuation of work-loss-days presented in our national-benefits-summaries , however , incorporates county-specific-adjustment-factors to account for variations in regional-income . valuation of premature-mortality 1 . base estimate the monetary-benefit of reducing premature-mortality-risk was estimated using the `` value of statistical-lives saved '' ( vsl ) approach , although the actual-valuation is of small-changes in mortality-risk experienced by a large number of people . the vsl approach applies information from several published value-of-life-studies , which themselves examine tradeoffs of monetary compensation for small additional-mortality-risks , to determine a reasonable-benefit of preventing premature-mortality . the mean-value of avoiding one statistical-death ( i.e. , the statistical incidence of a single-death , equivalent to a product of a population-risk-times a population-size that equals one ) is estimated to be $ 6 million in 1999 dollars . this represents an intermediate-value from a range of estimates that appear in the economics-literature , and it is a value the epa uses in rulemaking support-analyses and in the section 812 reports to congress . this estimate is the mean of a distribution fitted to the estimates from 26-value-of-life-studies identified in the section 812 reports as `` applicable to policy-analysis . '' the approach and set of selected studies-mirrors that of viscusi ( 1992 ) ( with the addition of two studies ) , and uses the same criteria as viscusi in his review of value-of-life-studies . the $ 6 million estimate is consistent with viscusi 's conclusion ( updated to 1999 $ ) that `` most of the reasonable-estimates of the value of life are clustered in the $ 3.7 to $ 8.6 million range . '' five of the 26 studies are contingent-valuation ( cv ) studies , which directly solicit wtp information from subjects ; the rest are wage-risk-studies , which base wtp estimates on estimates of the additional-compensation demanded in the labor market for riskier jobs , controlling for other job and employee-characteristics such as education and experience . as indicated in the previous-section on quantification of premature-mortality-benefits , we assume for this analysis that some of the incidences of premature-mortality related to pm exposures occur in a distributed fashion over the five years following-exposure . to take this into account in the valuation of reductions in premature-mortality , we apply an annual three percent-discount-rate to the value of premature-mortality occurring in future years.14 the economics-literature concerning the appropriate-method for valuing-reductions in premature-mortality-risk is still developing . the adoption of a value for the projected reduction in the risk of premature-mortality is the subject of continuing-discussion within the economic and public-policy analysis community . regardless of the theoretical economic-considerations , distinctions in the monetary-value assigned to the lives saved were not drawn , even if populations differed in age , health-status , socioeconomic-status , gender or other characteristics . following the advice of the eeac of the sab , the vsl approach was used to calculate the base estimate of mortality-benefits ( epa-sab-eeac-00-013 ) . while there are several-differences between the risk-context-implicit in labor market-studies we use to derive a vsl estimate and the particulate-matter air-pollution context addressed here , those differences in the affected-populations and the nature of the risks imply both upward and downward-adjustments . for example , adjusting for age-differences between subjects in the economic-studies and those affected by air-pollution may imply the need to adjust the $ 6 million vsl downward , but the involuntary nature of air pollution-related-risks and the lower level of risk-aversion of the manual-laborers in the labor market-studies may imply the need for upward-adjustments . in certain-cases , labor market-studies have not adequately controlled for non-fatal-injury risks and other unfavorable-job-attributes ( e.g . dirt and noise ) . these factors may increase the estimated-risk-premium for reductions in premature-mortality-risk . some economists emphasize that the value of a statistical-life is not a single-number relevant for all situations . indeed , the vsl estimate of $ 6 million ( 1999 dollars ) is itself the central-tendency of a number of estimates of the vsl for some rather narrowly defined populations . when there are significant-differences between the population affected by a particular-health risk and the populations used in the labor market-studies , as is the case here , some economists prefer to adjust the vsl estimate to reflect those differences . the cv-based-estimates of vsl collectively may better represent the population affected by pollution than the labor market-studies . there is general-agreement that the value to an individual of a reduction in mortality-risk can vary based on several-factors , including the age of the individual , the type of risk , the level of control the individual has over the risk , the individual's attitudes towards risk , and the health-status of the individual . while the empirical-basis for adjusting the $ 6 million vsl for many of these factors does not yet exist , a thorough-discussion of these uncertainties is included in epa 's guidelines for preparing economic-analyses ( u.s. epa , 2000a ) . the epa recognizes the need for investigation by the scientific-community to develop additional empirical-support for adjustments to vsl for the factors mentioned above . 14 the choice of a discount rate , and its associated conceptual basis , is a topic of ongoing-discussion within the federal government . we adopted a 3 percent-discount-rate for our base analysis in this case to reflect reliance on a `` social-rate of time preference '' discounting-concept . we have also calculated benefits using a 7-percent-rate consistent with an `` opportunity-cost of capital '' concept to reflect the time-value of resources directed to meet regulatory-requirements . in this analysis , the benefit-estimates were not significantly affected by the choice of discount rate . further discussion of this topic appears in epa 's guidelines for preparing economic-analyses , epa 240-r-00-003 , september 2000 . as further support for the base estimate , the sab-eeac advised in their recent-report that the epa `` continue to use a wage-risk-based vsl as its base estimate , including appropriate sensitivity-analyses to reflect the uncertainty of these estimates , '' and that `` the only risk-characteristic for which adjustments to the vsl can be made is the timing of the risk '' ( epa-sab-eeac-00-013 ) . in developing the base estimate of the benefits of premature-mortality-reductions , we have discounted over the lag-period between exposure and premature-mortality . however , in accordance with the sab advice , we use the vsl in the base estimate and present-age adjusted values in the tables of alternative-calculations , exhibit 12 and 13 . 2 . alternative-estimate the alternative-estimate reflects the impact of changes to key-assumptions associated with the valuation of mortality . these include : 1 ) the impact of using-wage-risk and contingent valuation-based-value of statistical-life-estimates in valuing-risk reductions from air-pollution as opposed to contingent valuation-based-estimates alone , 2 ) the relationship between age and willingness-to-pay for fatal-risk-reductions , and 3 ) the degree of prematurity in mortalities from air-pollution . the alternative-estimate addresses this issue by using an estimate of the value of statistical-life that is based only on the set of five contingent-valuation-studies included in the larger set of 26 studies recommended by viscusi ( 1992 ) as applicable to policy-analysis . the mean of the five contingent-valuation based vsl estimates is $ 3.7 million ( 1999 $ ) , which is approximately 60 percent of the mean-value of the full-set of 26 studies . the second issue is addressed by assuming that the relationship between age and willingness-to-pay for fatal-risk-reductions can be approximated using an adjustment-factor derived from jones-lee ( 1989 ) . the sab has advised the epa that the appropriate way to account for age-differences is to obtain the values for risk-reductions from the age-groups affected by the risk-reduction . several-studies have found a significant-effect of age on the value of mortality-risk-reductions expressed by citizens in the united kingdom ( jones-lee et al. , 1985 ; jones-lee , 1989 ; jones-lee , 1993 ) . two of these studies provide the basis to form ratios of the wtp of different-age cohorts to a base-age-cohort of 40 years . these ratios can be used to provide alternative age-adjusted-estimates of the value of avoided premature-mortalities . one problem with both of the jones-lee-studies is that they examine vsl for a limited-age range . they then fit vsl as a function of age and extrapolate outside the range of the data to obtain ratios for the very old . unfortunately , because vsl is specified as quadratic in age , extrapolation beyond the range of the data can lead to a very severe-decline in vsl at ages beyond 75 . a simpler and potentially less biased-approach is to simply apply a single-age-adjustment based on whether the individual was over or under 65 years of age at the time of death . this is consistent with the range of observed-ages in the jones-lee-studies and also agrees with the findings of more recent-studies by krupnick et al . ( 2000 ) that the only significant-difference in wtp is between the over 70 and under 70-age-groups . to correct for the potential-extrapolation-error for ages beyond 70 , the adjustment-factor is selected as the ratio of a 70 year old individual 's wtp to a 40 year old individual 's wtp , which is 0.63 , based on the jones-lee ( 1989 ) results and 0.92 based on the jones-lee ( 1993 ) results . to show the maximum-impact of the age-adjustment , the alternative-estimate is based on the jones-lee ( 1989 ) adjustment-factor of 0.63 , which yields a vsl of $ 2.3 million for populations over the age of 70 . deaths of individuals under the age of 70 are valued using the unadjusted mean vsl value of $ 3.7 million ( 1999 $ ) . since these are acute-mortalities , it is assumed that there is no lag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortality . jones-lee and krupnick may understate the effect of age because they only control for income and do not control for wealth . while there is no empirical-evidence to support or reject hypotheses regarding-wealth and observed wtp , wtp for additional-life-years by the elderly may in part reflect their wealth-position vis a vis middle-age-respondents . the third-issue is addressed by assuming that deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary-disease ( copd ) are advanced by 6 months , and deaths from all other causes are advanced by 5 years . these reductions in life-years lost are applied regardless of the age at death . actuarial-evidence suggests that individuals with serious-preexisting cardiovascular-conditions have a remaining-life-expectancy of around 5 years . while many deaths from daily-exposure to pm may occur in individuals with cardiovascular-disease , studies have shown relationships between all-cause-mortality and pm , and between pm and mortality from pneumonia ( schwartz , 2000 ) . in addition , recent-studies have shown a relationship between pm and non-fatal-heart-attacks , which suggests that some of the deaths due to pm may be due to fatal-heart-attacks ( peters et al. , 2001 ) . and , a recent-meta-analysis has shown little-effect of age on the relative-risk from pm exposure ( stieb et al . 2002 ) , which suggests that the number of deaths in non-elderly-populations ( and thus the potential for greater loss of life-years ) may be significant . indeed , this analysis-estimates that 21 percent of non-copd premature-deaths avoided are in populations under 65 . thus , while the assumption of 5 years of life lost may be appropriate for a subset of total avoided premature-mortalities , it may over or underestimate the degree of life shortening attributable to pm for the remaining-deaths . '' in order to value the expected-life years lost for copd and non-copd deaths , we need to construct estimates of the value of a statistical-life-year . the value of a life-year varies based on the age at death , due to the differences in the base vsl between the 65 and older population and the under 65 population . the valuation approach used is a value of statistical-life-years ( vsly ) approach , based on amortizing the base vsl for each age-cohort . previous applications have arrived at a single-value per life-year based on the discounted-stream of values that correspond to the vsl for a 40 year old worker ( u.s. epa , 1999a ) . this assumes 35 years of life lost is the base-value associated with the mean vsl value of $ 3.7 million ( 1999 $ ) . the vsly associated with the $ 3.7 million vsl is $ 163,000 , annualized assuming epa 's guideline-value of a 3 percent-discount-rate , or $ 270,000 , annualized assuming omb 's guideline-value of a 7 percent-discount-rate . the vsl applied in this analysis is then built up from that vsly by taking the present-value of the stream of life-years , again assuming a 3 % discount rate . thus , if you assume that a 40 year-old dying from pneumonia would lose 5 years of life , the vsl applied to that death would be $ 0.79 million . for populations over age 65 , we then develop a vsly from the age-adjusted-base vsl of $ 2.3 million . given an assumed remaining-life-expectancy of 10 years , this gives a vsly of $ 258,000 , assuming a 3 percent-discount-rate . again , the vsl is built based on the present-value of 5 years of lost life , so in this case , we have a 70 year old individual dying from pneumonia losing 5 years of life , implying an estimated-vsl of $ 1.25 million . as a final-step , these estimated-vsl-values are multiplied by the appropriate-adjustment-factors to account for changes in wtp over time , as outlined above . applying the vsly approach to the four categories of acute mortality-results in four separate-sets of values for an avoided premature-mortality based on age and cause of death . non-copd deaths for populations aged 65 and older are valued at $ 1.4 million per incidence in 2010 , and $ 1.6 million in 2020 . non-copd deaths for populations aged 64 and younger are valued at $ 0.88 million per incidence in 2010 , and $ 1.0 million in 2020 . copd deaths for populations aged 65 and older are valued at $ 0.15 million per incidence in 2010 , and $ 0.17 million in 2020 . finally , copd deaths for populations aged 64 and younger are valued at $ 0.096 million per incidence in 2010 , and $ 0.11 million in 2020 . the implied vsl for younger populations is less than that for older populations because the value per life-year is higher for older populations . since we assume that there is a 5-year loss in life-years for a pm-related-mortality , regardless of the age of person dying , this necessarily leads to a lower vsl for younger populations . valuation of avoided cases of chronic-bronchitis 1 . base estimate the best-available estimate of wtp to avoid a case of chronic-bronchitis ( cb ) comes from viscusi , et al . ( 1991 ) . the viscusi , et al . study , however , describes a severe-case of cb to the survey respondents . we therefore employ an estimate of wtp to avoid a pollution-related-case of cb , based on adjusting the viscusi , et al . ( 1991 ) estimate of the wtp to avoid a severe-case . this is done to account for the likelihood that an average-case of pollution-related cb is not as severe . the adjustment is made by applying the elasticity of wtp with respect to severity reported in the krupnick and cropper ( 1992 ) study . details of this adjustment procedure can be found in the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria and its supporting-documentation , and in the most recent-section 812 study ( epa 1999 ) . we use the mean of a distribution of wtp estimates as the central-tendency-estimate of wtp to avoid a pollution-related-case of cb in this analysis . the distribution incorporates uncertainty from three sources : ( 1 ) the wtp to avoid a case of severe cb , as described by viscusi , et al . ; ( 2 ) the severity-level of an average pollution-related-case of cb ( relative to that of the case described by viscusi , et al . ) ; and ( 3 ) the elasticity of wtp with respect to severity of the illness . based on assumptions about the distributions of each of these three uncertain-components , we derive a distribution of wtp to avoid a pollution-related-case of cb by statistical uncertainty analysis-techniques . the expected value ( i.e. , mean ) of this distribution , which is about $ 331,000 ( 1999 $ ) , is taken as the central-tendency-estimate of wtp to avoid a pm-related-case of cb . 2 . alternative-estimate for the alternative-estimate , a cost-of-illness-value is used in place of willingness-to-pay to reflect uncertainty about the value of reductions in incidences of chronic-bronchitis . in the base estimate , the willingness-to-pay-estimate was derived from two contingent-valuation-studies ( viscusi et al. , 1991 ; krupnick and cropper , 1992 ) . these studies were experimental-studies intended to examine new methodologies for eliciting-values for morbidity endpoints . although these studies were not specifically designed for policy-analysis , the sab ( epa-sab-council-adv-00-002 , 1999 ) has indicated that the severity-adjusted-values from this study provide reasonable-estimates of the wtp for avoidance of chronic-bronchitis . as with other contingent-valuation-studies , the reliability of the wtp estimates depends on the methods used to obtain the wtp values . in order to investigate the impact of using the cv based wtp estimates , the alternative-estimate relies on a value for incidence of chronic-bronchitis using a cost-of-illness estimate based cropper and krupnick ( 1990 ) which calculates the present-value of the lifetime expected costs associated with the illness . the current-cost-of-illness ( coi ) estimate for chronic-bronchitis is around $ 107,000 per case , compared with the current wtp estimate of $ 330,000 . valuation of changes in visibility estimating-benefits for visibility is a more difficult and less precise-exercise than estimating-health-benefits because the endpoints are not directly or indirectly valued in markets . the contingent-valuation ( cv ) method has been employed in the economics-literature to value-endpoint-changes for visibility ( chestnut and rowe , 1990a , 1990b ; chestnut and dennis , 1997 ) . the cv method values-endpoints by using carefully structured-surveys to ask a sample of people what amount of compensation is equivalent to a given change in environmental-quality . there is an extensive scientific-literature and body of practice on both the theory and technique of cv . the epa believes that well-designed and well-executed cv-studies are valid for estimating the benefits of air-quality-regulation . 15 individuals-value-visibility both in the places they live and work ( referred to as residential-visibility ) , and in the places they travel to for recreational-purposes ( referred to as recreational-visibility ) . although cv-studies that address both types of visibility exist , in our analysis we rely only on recreational-visibility-studies , as explained further below . we considered-benefits from two categories of visibility-changes : residential-visibility and recreational-visibility . residential-visibility-benefits are those that occur from visibility-changes in urban , suburban , and rural areas , and also in recreational-areas not listed as federal-class i areas.16 for the purposes of this analysis , recreational-visibility-improvements are defined as those that occur specifically in federal-class i areas . a key-distinction between recreational and residential-benefits is that only those people living in residential-areas are assumed to receive benefits from residential-visibility , while all households in the u.s. are assumed to derive some benefit from improvements in class i areas . only two existing-studies provide defensible monetary-estimates of the value of visibility 15concerns about the reliability of value-estimates from cv-studies arose because research has shown that bias can be introduced easily into these studies if they are not carefully conducted . accurately measuring wtp for avoided health and welfare losses depends on the reliability and validity of the data collected . there are several-issues to consider when evaluating study-quality , including but not limited to 1 ) whether the sample estimates of wtp are representative of the population wtp ; 2 ) whether the good to be valued is comprehended and accepted by the respondent ; 3 ) whether the wtp elicitation-format is designed to minimize strategic-responses ; 4 ) whether wtp is sensitive to respondent-familiarity with the good , to the size of the change in the good , and to income ; 5 ) whether the estimates of wtp are broadly-consistent with other estimates of wtp for similar-goods ; and 6 ) the extent to which wtp responses are consistent with established economic-principles . 16 the clean-air act designates 156 national-parks and wilderness-areas as class i areas for visibility-protection . changes . one is a study on residential-visibility conducted in 1990 ( mcclelland , et . al. , 1993 ) and the other is a 1988 survey on recreational-visibility-value ( chestnut and rowe , 1990a ; 1990b ) . both utilize the contingent-valuation-method . there has been a great deal of controversy and significant-development of both theoretical and empirical-knowledge about how to conduct cv surveys in the past decade . in epa 's judgment , the chestnut and rowe study contains many of the elements of a valid cv study and is sufficiently-reliable to serve as the basis for monetary-estimates of the benefits of visibility-changes in recreational areas.17 this study serves as an essential-input to our estimates of the benefits of recreational-visibility-improvements . consistent with sab advice , the epa has designated the mcclelland , et al . study as significantly less reliable for regulatory benefit-cost-analysis , although it does provide useful-estimates on the order of magnitude of residential-visibility-benefits ( epa-sab-council-adv-00-002 , 1999 ) . residential-visibility-benefits are therefore only included as part of our sensitivity-tests . the methods for this calculation are similar to the procedure for recreational-benefits . the chestnut and rowe study measured the demand for visibility in class i areas managed by the national park-service ( nps ) in three broad-regions of the country : california , the southwest , and the southeast . respondents in five states were asked about their willingness to pay to protect national-parks or nps-managed wilderness-areas within a particular-region . the survey used photographs reflecting different-visibility-levels in the specified recreational-areas . the visibility-levels in these photographs were later converted to deciviews for the current-analysis . the survey-data collected were used to estimate a wtp-equation for improved visibility . in addition to the visibility-change-variable , the estimating-equation also included-household-income as an explanatory-variable . the chestnut and rowe study did not measure values for visibility-improvement in class i areas outside the three regions . their study covered 86 of the 156 class i areas in the u.s. we can infer the value of visibility-changes in the other class i areas by transferring-values of visibility-changes at class i areas in the study-regions . however , these values are not as defensible and are thus presented only as a sensitivity-calculation . the estimated-relationship from the che stnut and rowe study is only directly-applicable to the populations represented by survey respondents . we used-benefits transfer methods to extrapolate these results to the population affected by the clear skies act . a general-willingness 17 an sab advisory-letter indicates that `` many members of the council believe that the chestnut and rowe study is the best-available . '' ( epa-sab-council-adv-00-002 , 1999 ) however , the committee did not formally approve use of these estimates because of concerns about the peer-reviewed status of the study . epa believes the study has received adequate-review and has been cited in numerous peerreviewed publications ( chestnut and dennis , 1997 ) . to pay equation for improved visibility ( measured in deciviews ) was developed as a function of the baseline-level of visibility , the magnitude of the visibility-improvement , and household-income . the behavioral-parameters of this equation were taken from analysis of the chestnut and rowe data . these parameters were used to calibrate wtp for the visibility-changes resulting from the clear skies act . the method for developing calibrated wtp functions is based on the approach developed by smith , et al . ( 1999 ) . available-evidence indicates that households are willing to pay more for a given visibility-improvement as their income-increases ( chestnut , 1997 ) . the benefits-estimates here incorporate chestnut 's estimate that a one percent-increase in income is associated with a 0.9 percent-increase in wtp for a given change in visibility . for the sensitivity-test-calculation for residential-visibility , the mcclelland , et al . study 's results were used to calculate the parameter to measure the effect of deciview-changes on wtp . the wtp-equation was then run for the population affected by the clear skies act . agricultural benefits the ozone-criteria document notes that `` ozone affects vegetation throughout the united states , impairing-crops , native-vegetation , and ecosystems more than any other air-pollutant '' ( us epa , 1996 ) . reduced levels of ground-level-ozone resulting from the final clear skies act will have generally beneficial-results on agricultural crop-yields and commercial-forest-growth . welldeveloped-techniques exist to provide monetary-estimates of these benefits to agricultural-producers and consumers . these techniques use models of planting-decisions , yield response-functions , and agricultural product-supply and demand . the resulting-welfare-measures are based on predicted changes in market prices and production costs . laboratory and field-experiments have shown reductions in yields for agronomic-crops exposed to ozone , including-vegetables ( e.g. , lettuce ) and field-crops ( e.g. , cotton and wheat ) . the most extensive-field-experiments , conducted under the national crop loss assessment network ( nclan ) , examined 15 species and numerous cultivars . the nclan results show that `` several economically important-crop-species are sensitive to ozone-levels typical of those found in the u.s. '' ( us epa , 1996 ) . in addition , economic-studies have shown a relationship between observed-ozone levels and crop-yields ( garcia , et al. , 1986 ) . to estimate-changes in crop-yields , we used biological exposure-response-information derived from controlled-experiments conducted by the nclan ( nclan , 1996 ) . for the purpose of our analysis , we analyze changes for the six most economically-significant crops for which c-r functions are available : corn , cotton , peanuts , sorghum , soybean , and winter wheat.18 for some crops there are multiple c-r functions , some more sensitive to ozone and some less . our estimate assumes that crops are evenly mixed between relatively-sensitive and relatively-insensitive varieties . we analyzed the economic-value associated with varying-levels of yield-loss for ozonesensitive-commodity-crops using the agsim© agricultural-benefits-model ( taylor , et al. , 1993 ) . agsim© is an econometric-simulation-model that is based on a large-set of statistically 18 the total value for these crops in 1998 was $ 47 billion . 40 estimated-demand and supply-equations for agricultural commodities produced in the united states . the model is capable of analyzing the effects of changes in policies that affect commodity crop-yields or production costs.19 the measure of benefits calculated by the model is the net change in consumer and producer-surplus from baseline-ozone concentrations to the ozone-concentrations resulting from attainment of particular-standards . using the baseline and post-control-equilibria , the model calculates the change in net consumer and producer-surplus on a crop-by-crop basis.20 dollar-values are aggregated across crops for each standard . the total dollar-value represents a measure of the change in social-welfare associated with implementation of the clear skies act . adjustments for changes in income over time recent sab deliberations on mortality and morbidity-valuation approaches suggest that some adjustments to unit-values are appropriate to reflect economic-theory ( epa-sab-eeac-00-013 , 2000 ) . as noted above , we apply one adjustment by discounting lagged mortality-incidence-effects . a second adjustment is conducted as part of the mortality , morbidity , and visibility-valuation procedures to incorporate the effect of changes in income over time on wtp . to estimate the effects of changes in income over time we use a procedure originally outlined in appendix h of the section 812 prospective report to congress ( epa 1999 ) . that procedure uses per capita-income-estimates generated from federal government projections of income and population-growth , and applies three different-income-elasticities for mortality , severe-morbidity , and light symptom effects.21 benefits for each of the categories - minor-health-effects , severe and chronic-health-effects ( which include chronic-bronchitis and premature-mortality ) , and visibility - were adjusted by multiplying the unadjusted-benefits by the appropriate-adjustment factor , listed in exhibit 10 below . 19agsim© is designed to forecast agricultural-supply and demand out to 2010 . we were not able to adapt the model to forecast out to 2020 . instead , we apply percentage-increases in yields from decreased ambient-ozone-levels in 2020 to 2010-yield-levels , and input these into an agricultural-sector-model held at 2010 levels of demand and supply . it is uncertain what impact this assumption will have on net-changes in surplus . 20 agricultural benefits differ from other health and welfare endpoints in the length of the assumed ozone-season . for agriculture , the ozone-season is assumed to extend from april to september . this assumption is made to ensure proper-calculation of the ozone-statistic used in the exposure-response-functions . the only crop affected by changes in ozone during april is winter-wheat . 21 note that the environmental-economics advisory-committee ( eeac ) of the sab advised epa to adjust wtp for increases in real-income over time , but not to adjust wtp to account for cross-sectional-income-differences `` because of the sensitivity of making such distinctions , and because of insufficient-evidence available at present '' ( epa-sab-eeac-00-013 ) . exhibit 10-adjustment-factors used to account for projected real-income growth through 2010 and 2020 benefit adjustment-factor adjustment-factor category ( 2010 ) ( 2020 ) minor health-effect 1.038 1.089 severe and chronic-health-effects 1.127 1.319 premature-mortality 1.112 1.278 visibility 1.272 1.758 the procedure used to develop these adjustment-factors is described in more detail in the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) . also note that no adjustments were made to benefits based on the cost-of-illness-approach or to work-loss-days . this assumption will also lead us to underpredict benefits since it is likely that increases in real u.s. income would also result in increased cost-of-illness ( due , for example , to increases in wages paid to medical-workers ) and increased cost of work-loss-days ( reflecting that if worker-incomes are higher , the losses resulting from reduced-worker-production would also be higher ) . the result of applying these adjustment-factors is an updated set of unit economic-values used in the valuation-step . we summarize these adjusted values in exhibit 11 . 42 endpoint-pollutant-valuation per case-valuation per case ( 2010 mean est . ) ( 2020 mean est . ) 1 this value reflects both the 5-year lag-adjustment and the adjustments for changes in real-income over time that are included in the mortality-valuation in our national-benefits-summaries . the lag-adjustment distributes the mortality-incidence over five years ( 25 percent in each of the first two years , and 17 percent for each of the remaining-years ) and discounts-mortality-benefits over this period at a rate of three percent . the adjustment to the mortality unit-valuation for growth in real-income in 2010 is achieved using an adjustment-factor of 1.112 . for 2020 , the adjustment-factor is 1.278 . 2 this value reflects the adjustment for changes in real-income over time that is included in the chronic-bronchitis valuation in our national-benefits-summaries . the adjustment to the chronic-bronchitis unit-valuation for growth in real-income in 2010 is achieved using an adjustment-factor of 1.127 . for 2020 , the adjustment-factor is 1.319 . 3 these values reflect the adjustment for changes in real-income over time that is included in the benefit valuations in our national-benefits-summaries . the adjustment to the unit-valuations of these endpoints for growth in real-income in 2010 is achieved using an adjustment-factor of 1.038 . for 2020 , the adjustment-factor is 1.089 . 4 the value of a work-loss day presented here represents the national-median . the valuation of work-loss-days presented in our national-benefits-summaries , however , incorporates county-specific-adjustment-factors to account for variations in regional-income . totals may not sum due to rounding . iii . major-uncertainties in benefits-analysis the estimates of avoided health-effects , improved visibility , and monetary-benefits of the clear skies act are based on a method that reflects peer-reviewed data , models , and approaches that are applied to support epa rulemakings and generate reports to congress on the benefits of air-pollution-regulation . although epa has made a concerted-effort to apply well-accepted-methods , there remain significant-uncertainties in the estimation of these benefits . there are three types of uncertainty that affect these estimates : in the remainder of this section , we discuss the major-sources of each of these three categories of uncertainty related to the estimate of avoided health-effects , avoided ecological-effects , and monetary-valuation of these benefits . our analysis of the clear skies act has not included formal-uncertainty-analyses , although we have conducted several-sensitivity-tests and have analyzed a full alternative-estimate . uncertainties associated with health-benefit-estimates within-study-variation within-study-variation refers to the precision with which a given study estimates the relationship between air-quality-changes and health-effects . health-effects studies provide both a `` best estimate '' of this relationship plus a measure of the statistical uncertainty of the relationship . this size of this uncertainty depends on factors such as the number of subjects studied and the size of the effect being measured . the results of even the most well designed epidemiological-studies are characterized by this type of uncertainty , though well-designed-studies typically-report narrower uncertainty-bounds around the best estimate than do studies of lesser quality . in selecting-health-endpoints , we generally focus on endpoints where a statistically-significant relationship has been observed , which by definition assures a reasonably 44 tight-confidence-interval around the best estimate of the mean concentration-response-relationship . across-study-variation across-study-variation refers to the fact that different published studies of the same pollutant/health effect relationship typically do not report identical-findings ; in some instances the differences are substantial . these differences can exist even between equally reputable-studies and may result in health-effect estimates that vary considerably . across-study-variation can result from two possible-causes . one possibility is that studies report different-estimates of the single true-relationship between a given pollutant and a health-effect due to differences in study-design , random-chance , or other factors . for example , a hypothetical-study conducted in new york and one conducted in seattle may report different c-r functions for the relationship between pm and mortality , in part because of differences between these two study-populations ( e.g. , demographics , activity-patterns ) . alternatively , study-results may differ because these two studies are in fact estimating different-relationships ; that is , the same reduction in pm in new york and seattle may result in different-reductions in premature-mortality . this may result from a number of factors , such as differences in the relative-sensitivity of these two populations to pm pollution and differences in the composition of pm in these two locations.22 in either case , where we identified multiple-studies that are appropriate for estimating a given health-effect , we generated a pooled-estimate of results from each of those studies . application of c-r relationship nationwide whether this analysis estimated the c-r relationship between a pollutant and a given health-endpoint using a single-function from a single-study or using multiple c-r functions from several-studies , each c-r relationship was applied uniformly throughout the u.s. to generate health-benefit-estimates . however , to the extent that pollutant/health effect relationships are region-specific , applying a location-specific c-r function at all locations in the u.s. may result in overestimates of health-effect-changes in some locations and underestimates of health-effect-changes in other locations . it is not possible , however , to know the extent or direction of the overall-effect on health-benefit-estimates introduced by application of a single c-r function to the entire u.s . this may be a significant-uncertainty in the analysis , but the current-state of the scientific-literature does not allow for a region-specific-estimation of health-benefits . uncertainties in the pm-mortality-relationship health researchers have consistently linked air-pollution , especially pm , with excess-mortality . a substantial-body of published scientific-literature recognizes a correlation between elevated pm concentrations and increased-mortality-rates . however , there is much about this relationship that is still uncertain.23 these uncertainties include : 22 pm is a mix of particles of varying-size and chemical properties . the composition of pm can vary considerably from one region to another depending on the sources of particulate-emissions in each region . 23the morbidity-studies used in the clear skies act benefits-analysis may also be subject to many of the uncertainties listed in this section . 24 much of this literature is summarized in the 1996 pm criteria-document ( us epa , 1996a ) . there is much about this relationship that is still uncertain . as stated in preamble to the 1997 pm national-ambient-air quality-standards ( 40 cfr 50 , 1997 ) , `` the consistency of the results of the epidemiological-studies from a large number of different-locations and the coherent-nature of the observed-effects are suggestive of a likely causal-role of ambient pm in contributing to the reported-effects , '' which include premature-mortality . the national academy of sciences , in their report on research-priorities for pm ( nas , 1998 ) , indicates that '' there is a great deal of uncertainty about the implications of the findings [ of an association between pm and premature-mortality ] for risk management , due to the limited scientific-information about the specific-types of particles that might cause adverse-health-effects , the contributions of particles of outdoor-origin to actual human-exposures , the toxicological-mechanisms by which the particles might cause adverse-health-effects , and other important questions . '' epa acknowledges these uncertainties ; however , for this analysis , we assume a causal-relationship between exposure to elevated pm and premature-mortality , based on the consistent evidence of a correlation between pm and mortality reported in the scientific-literature . 46 relationship independent of that for pm . however , most of the studies examined by ito and thurston only controlled for pm10 or broader measures of particles and did not directly control for pm2.5 . as such , there may still be potential for confounding of pm2.5 and ozone-mortality-effects , as ozone and pm2.5 are highly-correlated during summer-months in some areas.25 in its september 2001 advisory on the draft analytical-blueprint for the second section 812 prospective-analysis , the sab cited the thurston and ito study as a significant-advance in understanding the effects of ozone on daily-mortality and recommended-re-evaluation of the ozone mortality-endpoint for inclusion in the next prospective-study ( epa-sab-council-adv-01-004 , 2001 ) . thus , recent-evidence suggests that by not including an estimate of reductions in short-term-mortality due to changes in ambient-ozone , both the base and alternative-estimates may underestimate the benefits of implementation of the clear skies act . c shape of the c-r function . the shape of the true pm mortality c-r function is uncertain , but this analysis assumes the c-r function to have a log-linear-form ( as derived from the literature ) throughout the relevant-range of exposures . if this is not the correct-form of the c-r function , or if certain-scenarios predict concentrations well above the range of values for which the c-r function was fitted , avoided-mortality may be misestimated . c regional-differences . as discussed above , significant variability exists in the results of different pm/mortality studies . this variability may reflect regionally-specific c-r functions resulting from regional-differences in factors such as the physical and chemical-composition of pm . if true regional-differences exist , applying the pm/mortality c-r function to regions outside the study-location could result in mis-estimation of effects in these regions . c exposure/mortality lags . it is currently-unknown whether there is a time-lag -- a delay between changes in pm exposures and changes in mortality-rates -- in the chronic pm/mortality relationship . the existence of such a lag is important for the valuation of premature-mortality-incidence because economic-theory suggests that benefits occurring in the future should be discounted . there is no specific scientific-evidence of the existence or structure of a pm effects lag . however , current scientific-literature on adverse-health-effects similar to those associated with pm ( e.g. , smoking-related disease ) and the difference in the effect-size between chronic-exposure-studies and daily-mortality-studies suggest that all incidences of premature-mortality-reduction associated with a given incremental-change in pm exposure probably would not occur in the same year as the exposure-reduction . the smoking-related-literature also implies that lags of up to a few years are plausible . adopting the lag structure used in the tier 2/gasoline sulfur and heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel rias and endorsed by the sab ( epa-sab-council-adv-00-001 , 1999 ) , we assume a five-year-lag structure . this approach assumes that 25 percent of pm-related premature-deaths occur in each of the first two years after the exposure and the rest occur in equal-parts ( approximately 17 % ) in each of the ensuing three years . c cumulative-effects . as a general-point , we attribute the pm/mortality relationship in the 25 short-term ozone mortality-risk-estimates may also be affected by the statistical-issue discovered by the health-effects institute ( greenbaum , 2002a ) . see page 24 for a more detailed-discussion of this issue . underlying epidemiological-studies to cumulative-exposure to pm . however , the relative-roles of pm exposure-duration and pm exposure-level in inducing premature-mortality remain unknown at this time . uncertainties associated with environmental and ecosystem effects-estimation our analysis of the clear skies act includes a quantitative estimate of only two environmental-effects : recreational-visibility and ozone-effects on agriculture . scientific studies , however , have reliably linked atmospheric-emissions of sulfur , nitrogen , and mercury to a much wider range of other environmental and ecological-effects . some of these effects are acute in nature , and some are longer-term and could take many years to manifest . the effects include the following : these effects are left unquantified for a variety of reasons , but mostly because of the complexity of modeling these effects and the major-uncertainties in reliably quantifying the incremental effects of atmospheric-emissions-reductions on ecological endpoints . individually , many of these environmental-effects may be relatively-small in terms of their overall-ecosystem and monetary importance , particularly in the near-term . their cumulative and longer term-effects , however , some of which may be largely-unknown at this time , may be substantial . as a result , the omission of this broad-class of benefits from our quantitative-results likely-causes our estimates to substantially understate the total-benefits of the clear skies act . 48 uncertainties associated with economic-valuation of benefits economic-valuation of benefits often involves estimation of the willingness-to-pay of individuals to avoid harmful-health or environmental-effects . in most cases , there are no markets in which to directly observe wtp for these types of commodities . in some cases , we can rely on indirect-market-transactions , such as the implicit-tradeoff of wages for on-the-job-mortality-risk among the working-population , to estimate wtp . in other cases , we must rely on survey-approaches to estimate wtp , usually through a variant of the contingent-valuation-approach , which generally involves directly questioning-respondents for their wtp in hypothetical market-situations . regardless of the method used to estimate wtp , there are measurement-errors , data-inadequacies , and ongoing debates about the best-practices for each method that contribute to the overall-uncertainty of economic-estimates . general benefits-transfer considerations for the clear skies benefits-analysis , we do not have the time or resources to conduct primary economic-research targeted at the specific air pollution-related benefits provided . as a result , we rely on the transfer of benefits-estimates from existing-studies . the conduct of `` benefits-transfer '' exercises necessarily involves some uncertainties . these uncertainties can be reduced by careful-consideration of the differences in the health-risk or air-pollution commodity and the study-populations in the underlying economic-literature versus the context of benefits conferred by the clear skies act . for example , we make adjustments to the mortality-valuation estimates to account for the estimated-lag between exposure and manifestation of the effect , reflecting the basic economic-tenet that individuals prefer benefits that occur sooner to those that occur later . we also make adjustments to account for expected-changes in wtp over time as per capita-income-increases . we can not adjust for all benefits-transfer considerations , however , thus introducing additional-uncertainty into our estimates . lack of adequate-data or methods the lack of adequate-data or methods to characterize wtp results in our inability to present monetized-benefits of some categories of effects . for example , while studies exist that estimate the benefits of visibility-improvements to individuals in the places they reside , these residential-visibility-studies are considered by some in the resource-economics-community to be less reliable because of the methods applied . in the case of residential-visibility , we conduct sensitivity-analyses to estimate the impact of this uncertainty in the reliability of methods . to the extent effects such as these represent categories of benefits that are truly-valuable to the u.s. population , we have underestimated the total-benefits of the clear skies act . uncertainties specific to premature-mortality-valuation the economic-benefits associated with premature-mortality are the largest category of monetized-benefits of the clear skies act.26 in addition , in prior-analyses epa has identified valuation of mortality-benefits as the largest contributor to the range of uncertainty in monetized 26as noted in the methods-section , it is actually-reductions in mortality-risk that are valued in a monetized-benefit-analysis . individual-wtps for small-reductions in mortality-risk are summed over enough-individuals to infer the value of a statistical-life saved . this is different from the value of a particular , identified life saved . the `` value of a premature-death avoided , '' then , should be understood as shorthand for `` the value of a statistical premature-death avoided . '' benefits ( see usepa 1999a ) . because of the uncertainty in estimates of the value of premature-mortality-avoidance , it is important to adequately characterize and understand the various-types of economic-approaches available for mortality-valuation . such an assessment also requires an understanding of how alternative-valuation-approaches reflect that some individuals may be more susceptible to air pollution-induced mortality , or reflect differences in the nature of the risk presented by air-pollution relative to the risks studied in the relevant economic-literature . the health-science-literature on air-pollution indicates that several human-characteristics affect the degree to which mortality-risk affects an individual . for example , some age-groups appear to be more susceptible to air-pollution than others ( e.g. , the elderly and children ) . health-status prior to exposure also affects susceptibility . at risk-individuals include those who have suffered strokes or are suffering from cardiovascular-disease and angina ( rowlatt , et al . 1998 ) . an ideal-benefits estimate of mortality-risk-reduction would reflect these human-characteristics , in addition to an individual 's willingness to pay ( wtp ) to improve one 's own chances of survival plus wtp to improve other individuals ' survival rates.27 the ideal-measure would also take into account the specific-nature of the risk-reduction-commodity that is provided to individuals , as well as the context in which risk is reduced . to measure this value , it is important to assess how reductions in air-pollution reduce the risk of dying from the time that reductions take effect-onward , and how individuals-value these changes . each individual 's survival-curve , or the probability of surviving beyond a given age , should shift as a result of an environmental-quality-improvement . for example , changing the current-probability of survival for an individual also shifts future-probabilities of that individual 's survival . this probability-shift will differ across individuals because survival curves are dependent on such characteristics as age , health-state , and the current-age to which the individual is likely to survive . although a survival-curve-approach provides a theoretically preferred method for valuing the benefits of reduced risk of premature-mortality associated with reducing-air-pollution , the approach requires a great deal of data to implement . the economic-valuation literature does not yet include good-estimates of the value of this risk-reduction-commodity . as a result , in this study we value avoided premature-mortality-risk using the value of statistical-life-approach in the base estimate , supplemented by valuation based on an age-adjusted-value of statistical-life estimate in the alternative-estimate . other uncertainties specific to premature-mortality-valuation include the following : across-study-variation : the analytical-procedure used in the main-analysis to estimate the monetary-benefits of avoided premature-mortality assumes that the appropriate economic-value for each incidence is a value from the currently accepted range of the value of a statistical-life . this estimate is based on 26 studies of the value of mortal-risks . there is considerable-uncertainty as to whether the 26 studies on the value of a statistical-life provide adequate-estimates of the value of a statistical-life saved by air-pollution-reduction . although there is considerable variation in the analytical-designs and data used in the 26 underlying-studies , the majority of the studies involve the value of risks to a middle-aged working-population . most of the studies examine differences in wages of risky-occupations , using a wage-hedonic-approach . certain-characteristics of both the 27 for a more detailed-discussion of altruistic-values related to the value of life , see jones-lee ( 1992 ) . 50 population affected and the mortality-risk facing that population are believed to affect the average-willingness to pay ( wtp ) to reduce the risk . the appropriateness of a distribution of wtp estimates from the 26 studies for valuing the mortality-related benefits of reductions in air-pollution-concentrations therefore depends not only on the quality of the studies ( i.e. , how well they measure what they are trying to measure ) , but also on ( 1 ) the extent to which the risks being valued are similar , and ( 2 ) the extent to which the subjects in the studies are similar to the population affected by changes in pollution-concentrations . c level of risk-reduction . the transferability of estimates of the value of a statistical-life from the 26 studies to the clear skies act analysis rests on the assumption that , within a reasonable-range , wtp for reductions in mortality-risk is linear in risk-reduction . for example , suppose a study estimates that the average wtp for a reduction in mortality-risk of 1/100,000 is $ 50 , but that the actual mortality-risk-reduction resulting from a given pollutant-reduction is 1/10,000 . if wtp for reductions in mortality-risk is linear in risk-reduction , then a wtp of $ 50 for a reduction of 1/100,000 implies a wtp of $ 500 for a risk-reduction of 1/10,000 ( which is ten times the risk-reduction valued in the study ) . under the assumption of linearity , the estimate of the value of a statistical-life does not depend on the particular-amount of risk-reduction being valued . this assumption has been shown to be reasonable provided the change in the risk being valued is within the range of risks evaluated in the underlying-studies ( rowlatt et al . 1998 ) . c voluntariness of risks evaluated . although there may be several-ways in which jobrelated-mortality-risks differ from air pollution-related-mortality-risks , the most important-difference may be that job-related-risks are incurred voluntarily , or generally assumed to be , whereas air pollution-related-risks are incurred involuntarily . there is some evidence28 that people will pay more to reduce involuntarily incurred risks than risks incurred voluntarily . if this is the case , wtp estimates based on wage-risk-studies may understate wtp to reduce involuntarily incurred air pollution-related-mortality-risks . c sudden versus protracted-death . a final important-difference related to the nature of the risk may be that some workplace mortality-risks tend to involve sudden , catastrophic-events , whereas air pollution-related-risks tend to involve longer periods of disease and suffering prior to death . some evidence suggests that wtp to avoid a risk of a protracted-death involving prolonged suffering and loss of dignity and personal-control is greater than the wtp to avoid a risk ( of identical-magnitude ) of sudden-death . to the extent that the mortality-risks addressed in this assessment are associated with longer periods of illness or greater pain and suffering than are the risks addressed in the valuation-literature , the wtp measurements employed in the present-analysis would reflect a downward-bias . iv . results base estimate 28see , for example , violette and chestnut , 1983 . exhibits 12 and 13 present a summary of health-effects-benefits resulting from improvements in air-quality between the base case and the clear skies act scenarios . exhibit 12 presents the mean-estimate of avoided health-effects in 2010 and 2020 for each health-endpoint included in the base analysis . we estimate that reductions in exposure to fine pm and ozone due to the clear skies act will result in over 6,000 fewer deaths in 2010 and nearly 12,000 fewer deaths in 2020 , as well as nearly 4,000 fewer cases of chronic-bronchitis in 2010 and over 7,000 fewer cases in 2020 . in addition , 193,000 fewer asthma-attacks are estimated to occur in 2010 and 373,000 fewer in 2020 . exhibit 13 summarizes the mean-monetized health and visibility-benefits due to the clear skies act . as that exhibit-shows , we estimate the monetized-benefits of the clear skies act in the continental united states will be $ 44 billion in 2010 , including $ 43 billion in health-benefits and $ 1 billion in recreational-visibility-benefits . in 2020 , total-benefits increase to $ 96 billion , with $ 93 billion in health-benefits and $ 3 billion in recreational-visibility-benefits . the results of our regional-benefits-analysis indicate that the vast majority of the health-benefits of the clear skies act are realized in the easternmost 39 states , including the states of north dakota , south dakota , nebraska , kansas , oklahoma , and texas . we estimate total-benefits of $ 44 billion in these 39 states in 2010 , and $ 95 billion in 2020 . in addition to calculating the physical-effects and monetary impacts of the clear skies act , we also estimated the distribution of particulate-matter air-quality-improvements that will be experienced by the us population . exhibit 14 illustrates the numbers of individuals and the percent of the us population that they represent that will experience changes in ambient-particulate matter-concentrations in 2010 and 2020 . as indicated in the table , the clear skies act yields relatively-modest air-quality-improvements for about one-fourth of the us population ( i.e. , changes in pm concentrations of less than 0.25 µg/m3 ) , in both 2010 and 2020 , but more substantial-improvements for a large-percentage of the population , including-improvements in excess of 2 µg/m3 for more than 24 million individuals by 2020 . 52 exhibit 12 change in incidence of adverse-health-effects associated

health-endpoint included in the base analysis . under the alternative-estimate , the number of avoided cases of chronic-bronchitis , hospital and er visits , and minor-respiratory-illnesses and symptoms is the same as the base . the alternative-projects that reductions in exposure to fine pm and ozone due to the clear skies act will result in 3,800 avoided premature-deaths in 2010 and nearly 7,200 avoided premature-deaths in 2020 . the omission of long-term-impacts of particulate-matter on mortality-accounts for approximately 40-percent-reduction in the estimate of avoided premature-mortality in the alternative-estimate relative to the base estimate . exhibit 16 summarizes the mean-monetized health and visibility-benefits of the alternative-estimate , which will be $ 6.3 billion in 2010 and $ 14.1 billion in 2020 . the 40-percent-reduction in mortality under the alternative-estimate and the difference in valuation of premature-mortality and chronic-bronchitis explain the difference in benefits between these two approaches . even using the more conservative alternative-estimate benefit-projections , however , the benefits of clear skies still outweigh the costs of $ 3.7 billion in 2010 and $ 6.5 billion in 2020 . it is also important to note that both the alternative and base estimate are likely to underestimate the benefits of this proposal because of the many environmental and health-effects that we were unable to quantify in this analysis . 55 exhibit 15 alternative-estimate of the change in incidence of adverse-health-effects associated with

best-available data , models , and modeling-methodologies ; and the assumptions it considers most appropriate to adopt in the face of important-uncertainties . the majority of the analytical-assumptions used to develop the base estimate have been reviewed and approved by epa 's science advisory-board ( sab ) . however , we recognize that data and modeling-limitations as well as simplifying-assumptions can introduce significant-uncertainty into the benefit-results and that reasonable-alternative-assumptions exist for some inputs to the analysis , such as the mortality c-r functions . to address these concerns , we supplement our base estimate of benefits with a series of sensitivity-calculations that make use of other sources of concentration-response and valuation-data for key-benefits categories . these sensitivity-calculations are conducted only for the base estimate and not for the alternative-estimate . first we applied three alternative-concentrationresponse ( c-r ) functions to estimate premature-mortality-incidence . although we used the krewski , et al . ( 2000 ) mean-based ( `` pm2.5 ( dc ) , all causes '' ) model exclusively to derive our base estimate of avoided premature-mortality , this analysis also examined the sensitivity of the benefit-results to the selection of alternative c-r functions for premature-mortality . we used three sources of alternative c-r functions for this sensitivity-analysis : ( 1 ) an alternative specification of the pope/acs model from krewski , et al . ( 2000 ) that adjusted for spatial-correlation in the dataset ; ( 2 ) the original pope/acs model ; and ( 3 ) the krewski et al . `` harvard six cities '' estimate . exhibits 15 and 16 present the results of these sensitivity-analyses for 2010 and 2020 , respectively . the first alternative c-r function is based on the relative-risk of 1.16 from the `` fine-particles alone , regional adjustment random effects '' model reported in table 46 of the hei report . commentary by an independent-review-panel noted that `` a major-contribution of the [ hei ] reanalysis project is the recognition that both pollutant variables and mortality appear to be spatially correlated in the acs data-set . if not identified and modeled correctly , spatial-correlation could cause substantial-errors in both the regression coefficients and their standard-errors ( hei , 2000 ) . '' this c-r function is a reasonable-specification to explore the impact of adjustments for broad regional-correlations . however , the hei report noted that the spatial-adjustment-methods `` may have over adjusted the estimated-effect for regional-pollutants such as fine-particles and sulfate compared with the effect estimates for more local-pollutants such as sulfur-dioxide . '' thus , the estimates of avoided incidences of premature-mortality based on this c-r function may underestimate the true-effect . ( note that this c-r function is based on the original air-quality dataset used in the acs study , covering 50 cities , and used the median pm2.5 levels rather than mean pm2.5 as the indicator of exposure . ) for comparison with earlier benefits-analyses , such as the first section 812 prospective-analysis , we also include estimates of avoided incidences of premature-mortality based on the 58 original acs/pope et al . ( 1995 ) analysis in the second row of exhibit 15 and 16 . the third-row of exhibit 17 shows the krewski , et al . `` harvard six cities '' estimate of mortality . the krewski-harvard six cities study used a smaller sample of individuals from fewer cities than the study by pope , et al . ; however , it features improved exposure-estimates , a slightly broader study-population ( adults aged 25 and older ) , and a follow-up-period nearly twice as long as that of pope , et al . the sab has noted that `` the [ harvard six cities ] study had better monitoring with less measurement-error than did most other studies '' ( epa-sab-council-adv-99-012 , 1999 ) . second , we use an alternative-valuation-procedure to estimate the value of avoided premature-mortality , with explicit consideration of the expected-age of mortality-incidence associated with air-pollution-exposure . age-specific vsl adjustment-factors can be derived from a series of contingent-valuation-studies conducted in the united kingdom to evaluate wtp for road-safety improvements that reduce mortality-risk . the two available-sources , both authored by michael jones-lee , derive significantly differing adjustment-factors , and reflect reflecting the overall-uncertainty within the literature about age-specific vsl adjustments . the results of this alternative-calculation reduce the overall base estimate for the clear skies act by 43 percent for the more extreme-adjustment derived from jones-lee ( 1989 ) , and by 9 percent for the less extreme-adjustment derived from jones-lee ( 1993 ) , as summarized in exhibits 15 and 16 below . the specific-adjustment procedure applied is described in more detail in the heavy-duty engine/diesel fuel ria ( u.s. epa , 2000b ) . third , as noted in the section above on visibility-valuation , we chose not to include in our base estimate the valuation of residential-visibility or valuation of recreational-visibility at class i areas outside of the study-regions examined in the chestnut and rowe ( 1990a , 1990b ) study . the last three rows of exhibits 17 and 18 summarize the impact of applying the existing-visibility valuation-literature more broadly than in our base estimate . 59 exhibit 17 key-sensitivity-analyses for the clear skies act in 2010a impact on base benefits description of basis for analysis avoided incidences estimate adjusted for growth in real-income ( billion 1999 $ ) concentration-response-functions for pm-related premature-mortality krewski/acs study regional 7,300 + $ 5.8 ( +13 % ) adjustment modelb pope/acs studyc 7,700 + $ 8.5 ( +20 % ) krewski/harvard six-city studyd 18,800 + $ 80 ( +182 % ) methods for valuing-reductions in incidences of pm-related premature-mortality a these results indicate the sensitivity of the primary-benefits estimate to alternative-assumptions ;
