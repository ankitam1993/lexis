kiosks for court-forms work well , study says system to help the uninitiated fill out minor-paperwork could go statewide , agency says . may 23 , 2002 by courtney perkes the orange county register roberta adams skipped the thick how-to-guide on child-custody forms and sat down at a computer at the lamoreaux justice-center in orange on wednesday . the garden grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court . `` it 's easy , '' said adams , 25 . `` i thought i 'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms-home . '' a university of california , irvine , study released wednesday found an interactive-computer-system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining-orders , eviction-defense , small-claims-cases and requests for filing-fee-waivers . not only does the system make life easier for people who ca n't afford a lawyer , but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms , which are printed out when completed , are easy to read and are being filled out correctly , the study found . since the program started in 2000 , more than 6,000 people have used the free-system , located in public-buildings throughout orange county . the system was developed by the legal-aid society of orange county with about $ 800,000 in grants . the program avoids legal jargon , offers a courthouse-video-tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary . users can choose english , spanish or vietnamese . kiosks are in courthouses in fullerton and orange , the district-attorney 's family-support-office , the legal-aid society in santa ana , irvine city hall and the san juan capistrano library . the program is also available-online . bob cohen , executive director of legal-aid , said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout california . locally , a program for divorce-petitions will be added this summer . cohen said the system proves the benefit of technology tailored to those who are n't-computer-savvy . he said much of the technology now available requires internet-skills and access . low-income-people , however , have less access to computers and less experience using them . `` our clients have to catch up , and they have to become a part of the mainstream , '' cohen said . bonnie hough , supervising-attorney for the california judicial council in san francisco , said the system in orange county is one of the best in the nation because it is comprehensive and easy to follow . `` the way the program works is it asks you questions rather than giving you a form , '' hough said . `` a lot of people are just intimidated by forms , whether they 're easy or not . think of all the people that go to h & r block for a 1040 ez . '' family support commissioner salvador sarmiento said he 's noticed the quality of documents filed with help from the computer kiosks . `` a large-percentage of the people that come before me do not have attorneys , '' sarmiento said . `` anything that can assist them in preparation for their hearing is much appreciated . '' wendy maloney spent nearly an hour filling out a request for a restraining-order on the computer in orange . she wore-headphones to listen to instructions and also read them on the screen . `` you 're going through domestic-violence and you 're going to be nervous with that kind of paperwork , and you want to do it right , '' she said .
