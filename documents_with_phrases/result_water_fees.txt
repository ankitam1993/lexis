alpaugh-water-fees may triple it 's either a big-increase or a loss of service for the tulare county town . by joan obra alpaugh-residents may see their water-fees triple to avoid losing-service at the end of the month . the debate will unfold tonight at a tulare county water works district 1 meeting . the district , which provides water-service to homes in alpaugh , faces an unpalatable-choice : raise its monthly $ 20-household-fee or go without the arsenic-tainted and undrinkable water . tulare county water works ' contract with its only supplier , alpaugh-irrigation district , which supplies water to farmers in the area , ends july 1 . and alpaugh-irrigation , which provides water , recordkeeping and maintenance-services to tulare county water works , is scaling back its role . the district will sell only water as of july 1 , at a monthly-price of $ 43.50 for a household . `` we can no longer do it for $ 20 , '' said alpaugh-irrigation-board president steve martin . the district , which did n't increase prices fast enough to meet the rising-cost of delivering-water , amassed an estimated $ 330,000 power bill during the state-energy-crisis . last month , alpaugh-irrigation-customers approved a monthly-fee-increase from $ 20 to $ 68 . if tulare county water works wants to keep its 170 hookups flowing , martin said , it must also raise rates . tulare county water works ca n't raise prices until a july 17 election . the propertyrelated-fee-increase requires voter-approval under proposition 218 , a process tulare county water works officials started after they learned the outcome of alpaugh-irrigation 's vote . at tonight 's tulare county water works ' informational-meeting , leaders will explain the rules . to block the possible-fee-increase , 51 % of property-owners in the district must submit protest-votes in writing . no protest-vote means approval of the price-jump . but misinformation already is rampant . sandra meraz , tulare county water works board-president , interrupted an interview tuesday when a screaming and crying-farmworker arrived . the farmworker thought the water was getting turned off today , meraz explained later . part of the confusion stems from prop . 218 . a section of it calls eligible-voters `` owners of record . '' another calls them '' tenants ... directly-liable to pay the assessment , fee , or charge in question . '' alpaugh-irrigation 's board limited the voter-pool to property-owners , sending each english-only-notices . there were n't enough spanish-speaking-voters to warrant bilingual-notices , martin explained in may . but that move left spanish-speakers and renters angry . as a result , chris schneider , executive director of central california legal-services , is building a lawsuit against alpaugh-irrigation . the district `` should have sent-notices to renters in addition to property-owners , '' he said . tulare county water works may also come under schneider's fire . the district sent-notices only to property-owners because `` it's a property-related-fee , '' attorney patrick enright said . he 's not yet-sure whether tulare county water works will accept renters' protest-votes at the july 17 meeting
