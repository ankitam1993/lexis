comptroller general of the united states united states general-accounting-office washington , dc 20548 decision of the comptroller general concerning nepdg litigation january 30 , 2002 as you know , the united states general-accounting-office ( gao ) has been engaged in an ongoing-effort to obtain certain narrowly defined , factual-information concerning the development of the national-energy-policy proposal from vice-president cheney in his role as chair of the national-energy-policy development group ( nepdg ) . importantly , we are only seeking limited-information in connection with nepdg-related matters . the administration used the nepdg as a mechanism to , among other things , outreach to selected non-governmental-parties and develop a proposed comprehensive-energy-policy . in addition , contrary to recent-assertions , we are not seeking the minutes of these meetings or related notes of the vice-president 's staff . this was conveyed to the white house in writing on august 17 , 2001 . unfortunately , despite our numerous-attempts to reach a reasoned and reasonable-accommodation on this matter , to date , the information we requested has not been made available to us . in his august 2 , 2001 , letter to both houses of congress , the vice-president raised a number of objections to providing the information we requested . importantly , for both the congress and gao , the vice-president challenged gao 's fundamental-statutory authority to assist the congress in connection with its constitutional , legislative and oversight-authorities . these challenges went far beyond issues relating to his constitutional position as vice-president and white house-staff related matters . as noted in our prior-correspondence concerning this matter , the information we are seeking is clearly within our statutory-audit and access-authority . accordingly , as provided in our statutory-access-authority , on july 18 , 2001 , we issued a formal-request for the records . unfortunately , the statutory 20-day response period passed without any meaningful-action by the office of the vice-president . in accordance with the prescribed-statutory-process , on august 17 , 2001 , we reported to the congress , the president , the vice-president , and other officials that the nepdg had not provided the requested records . ( see enclosed august 17 , 2001 , report . ) while the nepdg did provide some cost-related-documents to gao , most of these documents were not useful or self-explanatory . moreover , even though the vice-president and his counsel acknowledge our authority to access-cost-information , they have not provided us the remaining-cost-information and explanations requested . apart from information concerning the vice president's meetings , they also have not provided us with factual-information concerning who the nepdg staff , including non-white house-staff who were assigned to the nepdg from various-government-departments and agencies , met with and the purpose of those meetings . we strongly disagree with the vice-president 's objections to our audit and access-authority . significantly , under gao 's statutory-access-authority , congress provided the president and the director of the office of management and budget a safety-valve to preclude judicial-enforcement of gao 's access-rights . the executive-branch has chosen not to use this mechanism . furthermore , the president has not claimed executive-privilege in connection with our request . as previously noted , all of our attempts to reach a reasoned and reasonable-accommodation , including reducing the scope of our request , have been rebuffed , and we have now exhausted the statutory-process for resolving our access-requests . as a result , our only remaining-recourse is either to file suit in the united states district-court for the district of columbia or to forego further assertion of our access-rights . gao was preparing to go to court in september of this past year until the tragic-events of september 11 . as i stated last september , prudence dictated that we delay any related legal action given the immediate need for the administration and the congress to focus on developing our nation 's initial-response to our fight against international-terrorism and efforts to protect our homeland . the congress has a right to the information we are seeking in connection with its consideration of comprehensive-energy-legislation and its ongoing-oversight-activities . energy-policy is an important economic and environmental-matter with significant domestic and international-implications . it affects the lives of each and every american . how it is formulated has understandably been a longstanding-interest of the congress . in addition , the recent-bankruptcy of enron has served to increase congressional-interest in energy-policy , in general , and nepdg activities , in particular . this , plus the senate 's expected consideration of comprehensive-energy-legislation this session , reinforces the need for the information we requested concerning the development of the national-energy-policy proposal . in this regard , we recently received a request for the nepdg information we are seeking from four senate committee and subcommittee-chairmen with jurisdiction over the matters involved . importantly , our governing-statute requires gao to perform such committee-requests . clearly , the formulation and oversight of energy-policy and the investigation of enron-related-activities represent important institutional-prerogatives of the congress . furthermore , a number of other important-principles are involved . failure to provide the information we are seeking serves to undercut the important-principles of transparency and accountability in government . these principles are important-elements of a democracy . they represent basic-principles of `` good-government '' that transcend administrations , partisan-politics , and the issues of the moment . as such , they should be vigorously defended . otherwise , it could erode public-confidence in and respect for the institutions of government . the disclosure of the activities of the nepdg is also important for precedential-reasons . specifically , the nepdg was financed with appropriated-funds and staffed largely by government-department and agency-personnel assigned to it . we disagree with the white house position that the formation of energy-policy by the nepdg is page 2 beyond congressional-oversight and gao review . were the vice-president 's arguments in this case to prevail , any administration seeking to insulate its activities from oversight and public-scrutiny could do so simply by assigning those activities to the vice-president or a body under the white house's direct-control . in our view , failure to pursue this matter could lead to a pattern of records-access-denials that would significantly undercut gao 's ability to assist congress in exercising its legislative and oversight-authorities . we would have strongly preferred to avoid litigation in connection with this matter , but given the request by the four senate committee and subcommittee-chairmen , our rights to this information and the important-principles and precedents involved , gao will take the steps necessary to file suit in united states district-court in order to obtain , from the chair of the nepdg , the information outlined in our august 17 , 2001 , report . this will be the first time that gao has filed-suit to enforce our access-rights against a federal-official . we hope it is the last time that we will have to do so . we have great-confidence in our nation 's legal-system and look for a timely-resolution of this important-matter . if you have any questions , comments or concerns , please do not hesitate to contact me . sincerely yours , [ signed ] david m. walker comptroller general of the united states cc : president of the united states vice-president of the united states enclosure page 3
