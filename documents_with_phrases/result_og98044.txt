( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 , and 609 in the preamble to the final-rule , hcfa discusses , in the form of a combined regulatory-impact-analysis and regulatory-flexibility-analysis , the effect of the final-rule on small-entities . the small-entities include most providers , physicians , and health care suppliers , either by virtue of their non-profit-status or by having revenues of $ 5 million or less annually . hcfa states that it is clear that the rule will have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities since the aggregate per-beneficiary-limitation will reduce payments by approximately 9 percent . while hcfa states that it has examined the options for lessening the burden on small-entities , since the statute does not allow for any exceptions to the aggregate per-beneficiary-limitation based on the size of the entity , no regulatory-relief can be provided for small-entities .
