methods for measuring the acute-toxicity of effluents and receiving-waters to freshwater and marine-organisms fifth-edition october 2002 u.s. environmental-protection agencyoffice of water ( 4303t ) 1200 pennsylvania avenue , nw washington , dc 20460 epa-821-r-02-012 the engineering and analysis division , of the office of science and technology , has reviewed and approved this report for publication . neither the united states government nor any of its employees , contractors , or their employees make any warranty , expressed or implied , or assumes any legal-liability or responsibility for any third party 's use of or the results of such use of any information , apparatus , product , or process discussed in this report , or represents that its use by such party would not infringe on privately owned rights . introduction 1.1 this manual describes acute-toxicity-tests for use in the national pollutant discharge elimination system ( npdes ) permits program to identify effluents and receiving-waters containing toxic-materials in acutely-toxic concentrations . with the exception of the holmesimysis-costata acute-test ( table 19 ) , the methods included in this manual are referenced in table ia , 40 cfr part 136 regulations and , therefore , constitute approved methods for acute-toxicity-tests . they are also suitable for determining the toxicity of specific-compounds contained in discharges . the tests may be conducted in a central-laboratory or on-site , by the regulatory-agency or the permittee . the holmesimysis-costata acute-test ( table 19 ) is specific to pacific coast waters and is not listed at 40 cfr part 136 for nationwide-use . this method has been proposed but not yet approved at 40 cfr part 136 . 1.2 the data are used for npdes-permits development and to determine compliance with permit-toxicity-limits . data can also be used to predict potential acute and chronic-toxicity in the receiving-water , based on the lc50 and appropriate-dilution , application , and persistence-factors . the tests are performed as a part of self-monitoring-permit-requirements , compliance biomonitoring-inspections , toxics sampling-inspections , and special-investigations . data from acute-toxicity-tests performed as part of permit-requirements are evaluated during compliance-evaluation-inspections and performance-audit-inspections . 1.3 modifications of these tests are also used in toxicity reduction-evaluations and toxicity-identification-evaluations to identify the toxic-components of an effluent , to aid in the development and implementation of toxicity-reduction-plans , and to compare and control the effectiveness of various-treatment technologies for a given type of industry , irrespective of the receiving-water ( usepa , 1988a ; usepa , 1988b ; usepa , 1989a ; usepa , 1989b ; usepa , 1991a ) . 1.4 this methods-manual serves as a companion to the short-term-chronic-toxicity test-methods manuals for freshwater and marine-organisms ( usepa , 2002a ; usepa , 2002b ) , the npdes compliance inspection-manual ( usepa , 1988c ) , and the manual for evaluation of laboratories performing aquatic-toxicity-tests ( usepa , 1991b ) . in 2002 , epa revised previous-editions of each of the three methods-manuals ( usepa , 1993a ; usepa , 1994a ; usepa , 1994b ) . 1.5 guidance for the implementation of toxicity-tests in the npdes program is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxics control ( usepa , 1991c ) . 1.6 the use of any test-species or test-conditions other than those described in tables 12-18 in this manual and referenced in table 1a , 40 cfr 136.3 , shall be considered a major-modification to the method and subject to application and approval of alternate-test-procedures under 40 cfr 136.4 and 40 cfr 136.5 . 1.7 these methods are restricted to use by , or under the supervision of , analysts experience in the use or conduct of , and interpretation of data from , aquatic-toxicity-tests . each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable-test-results with the methods using the procedures described in this methods-manual . 1.8 this manual was prepared in the established emsl-cincinnati format ( usepa , 1983a ) . 2.1 the selection of the test-type will depend on the npdes permit-requirements , the objectives of the test , the available-resources , the requirements of the test-organisms , and effluent characteristics such as fluctuations in effluent-toxicity . 2.2 effluent acute-toxicity is generally measured using a multi-concentration , or definitive-test , consisting of a control and a minimum of five effluent-concentrations . the tests are designed to provide dose-response-information , expressed as the percent-effluent concentration that is lethal to 50 % of the test-organisms ( lc50 ) within the prescribed-period of time ( 24-96 h ) , or the highest effluent-concentration in which survival is not statistically significantly-different from the control . 2.3 use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single-effluent concentration ( e.g. , the receiving-water-concentration or rwc ) and a control is not recommended . if the npdes permit has a whole effluent-toxicity-limit for acute-toxicity at the rwc , it is prudent to use that permit-limit as the midpoint of a series of five effluent-concentrations . this will ensure that there is sufficient-information on the dose-response-relationship . for example , the effluent-concentrations utilized in a test may be : ( 1 ) 100 % effluent , ( 2 ) ( rwc + 100 ) /2 , ( 3 ) rwc , ( 4 ) rwc/2 , and ( 5 ) rwc/4 . more specifically , if the rwc = 50 % , appropriate-effluent concentrations may be 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % , and 12.5 % . 2.4 receiving ( ambient ) water-toxicity-tests commonly employ two treatments , a control and the undiluted receiving-water , but may also consist of a series of receiving-water dilutions . 2.5 a negative-result from an acute-toxicity-test does not preclude the presence of chronic-toxicity . also , because of the potential-temporal-variability in the toxicity of effluents , a negative-test-result with a particular-sample does not preclude the possibility that samples collected at some other time might exhibit acute ( or chronic ) toxicity . 2.6 the frequency with which acute-toxicity-tests are conducted under a given npdes permit is determined by the regulatory-agency on the basis of factors such as the variability and degree of toxicity of the waste , production-schedules , and process-changes . 2.7 tests may be static ( static-non-renewal or static-renewal ) , or flow-through . 2.7.1 static-tests 2.7.1.1 static-non-renewal tests - the test-organisms are exposed to the same test-solution for the duration of the test . 2.7.1.2 static-renewal-tests - the test-organisms are exposed to a fresh-solution of the same concentration of sample every 24 h or other prescribed-interval , either by transferring the test-organisms from one test-chamber to another , or by replacing all or a portion of solution in the test-chambers . 2.7.2 flow-through-tests 2.7.2.1 two types of flow-through-tests are in common-use : ( 1 ) sample is pumped continuously from the sampling-point directly to the dilutor-system ; and ( 2 ) grab or composite-samples are collected periodically , placed in a tank adjacent to the test-laboratory , and pumped continuously from the tank to the dilutor-system . the flow-through-method employing continuous-sampling is the preferred method for on-site-tests . because of the large-volume ( often 400 l/day ) of effluent normally required for flow-through-tests , it is generally considered too costly and impractical to conduct these tests off-site at a central-laboratory . 2.8 advantages and disadvantages of the types of tests are as follows : 2.8.1 static-non-renewal tests 2.8.1.1 advantages : 1 . simple and inexpensive . 2 . very cost effective in determining-compliance with permit conditions . 3 . limited-resources ( space , manpower , equipment ) required ; would permit staff to perform many more tests in the same amount of time . 4 . smaller volume of effluent required than for static-renewal or flow-through-tests . 2.8.1.2 disadvantages : 1 . dissolved oxygen ( do ) depletion may result from high chemical-oxygen-demand ( cod ) , biological-oxygen-demand ( bod ) , or metabolic-wastes . 2 . possible-loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or adsorption to the exposure-vessels . 3 . generally less sensitive than static-renewal or flow-through-tests , because the toxic-substances may degrade or be adsorbed , thereby reducing the apparent-toxicity . also , there is less chance of detecting-slugs of toxic-wastes , or other temporal-variations in waste-properties . 2.8.2 static-renewal , acute-toxicity-tests 2.8.2.1 advantages : 1 . reduced possibility of dissolved oxygen ( do ) depletion from high chemical-oxygen-demand ( cod ) and/or biological-oxygen-demand ( bod ) , or ill-effects from metabolic-wastes from organisms in the test-solutions . 2 . reduced possibility of loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or adsorption to the exposure-vessels . 3 . test-organisms that rapidly deplete-energy-reserves are fed when the test-solutions are renewed , and are maintained in a healthier-state . 2.8.2.2 disadvantages : 1 . require greater volume of effluent that non-renewal-tests . 2 . generally less sensitive than flow-through-tests , because the toxic-substances may degrade or be adsorbed , thereby reducing the apparent-toxicity . also , there is less chance of detecting-slugs of toxic-wastes , or other temporal-variations in waste-properties . 2.8.3 flow-through-tests 2.8.3.1 advantages : 1 . provide a more representative-evaluation of the acute-toxicity of the source , especially if sample is pumped continuously directly from the source and its toxicity varies with time . 2 . do concentrations are more easily maintained in the test-chambers . 3 . a higher loading-factor ( biomass ) may be used . 4 . the possibility of loss of toxicant due to volatilization , adsorption , degradation , and uptake is reduced . 2.8.3.2 disadvantages : 1 . large-volumes of sample and dilution-water are required . 2 . test-equipment is more complex and expensive , and requires more maintenance and attention . 3 . more space is required to conduct tests . 4 . because of the resources required , it would be very difficult to perform multiple or overlapping-sequential tests . health and safety 3.1 general precautions 3.1.1 development and maintenance of an effective-health and safety-program in the laboratory requires an ongoing-commitment by laboratory-management , and includes ( 1 ) the appointment of a laboratory-health and safety-officer with the responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a safety-program , ( 2 ) the preparation of a formal , written , health and safety-plan , which is provided to each laboratory-staff-member , ( 3 ) an ongoing-training-program on laboratory-safety , and ( 4 ) regularly scheduled , documented , safety-inspections . 3.1.2 collection and use of effluents in toxicity-tests may involve significant-risks to personal-safety and health . personnel collecting effluent-samples and conducting-toxicity-tests should take all safety-precautions necessary for the prevention of bodily injury and illness which might result from ingestion or invasion of infectious-agents , inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxic-substances through skin-contact , and asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen or presence of noxious-gases . 3.1.3 prior to sample-collection and laboratory-work , personnel must determine that all required-safety-equipment and materials have been obtained and are in good-condition . 3.1.4 guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous-materials must be strictly followed . 3.2 safety-equipment 3.2.1 personal-safety gear 3.2.1.1 personnel must use safety-equipment , as required , such as rubber-aprons , laboratory-coats , respirators , gloves , safety glasses , hard-hats , and safety-shoes . 3.2.2 laboratory-safety equipment 3.2.2.1 each laboratory ( including mobile-laboratories ) must be provided with safety-equipment such as first aid-kits , fire-extinguishers , fire-blankets , emergency-showers , and eye-fountains . 3.2.2.2 mobile-laboratories should be equipped with a telephone to enable personnel to summon help in case of emergency . 3.3 general laboratory and field operations 3.3.1 guidance in material safety data sheets should be followed for reagents and other chemicals purchased from supply houses . incompatible-materials should not be stored together . 3.3.2 work with effluents must be performed in compliance with accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardous-materials ( see safety-manuals , subsection 3.5 ) . personnel collecting-samples and performing-toxicity-tests should not work alone . 3.3.3 because the chemical-composition of effluents is usually only poorly known , they must be considered as potential-health hazards , and exposure to them should be minimized . fume and canopy hoods over the test-areas must be used whenever necessary . 3.3.4 it is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the body immediately after collecting effluent-samples . 3.3.5 all containers must be adequately labeled to indicate their contents . 3.3.6 strong-acids and volatile organic-solvents employed in glassware-cleaning must be used in a fume-hood or under an exhaust canopy over the work-area . 3.3.7 good-housekeeping contributes to safety and reliable-results . 3.3.8 electrical-equipment or extension-cords not bearing the approval of underwriter-laboratories must not be used . ground-fault interrupters must be installed in all `` wet '' laboratories where electrical-equipment is used . 3.3.9 mobile-laboratories must be properly grounded to protect against electrical-shock . 3.4 disease prevention 3.4.1 personnel handling-samples which are known or suspected to contain human-wastes should be immunized against hepatitis b , tetanus , typhoid-fever , and polio . 3.5 safety-manuals 3.5.1 for further guidance on safe-practices when collecting effluent-samples and conducting-toxicity-tests , check with the permittee and consult general industrial-safety-manuals , including usepa ( 1986 ) and walters and jameson ( 1984 ) . 3.6 waste disposal 3.6.1 wastes generated during toxicity-testing must be properly handled and disposed of in an appropriate-manner . each testing facility will have its own waste-disposal-requirements based on local , state , and federal-rules and regulations . it is extremely-important that these rules and regulations be known , understood , and complied with by all persons responsible for , or otherwise involved in , performing-testing-activities . local-fire-officials should be notified of any potentially-hazardous conditions . quality-assurance 4.1 introduction 4.1.1 development and maintenance of a toxicity-test-laboratory quality-assurance ( qa ) program requires an ongoing-commitment by laboratory-management , and includes the following : ( 1 ) appointment of a laboratory quality-assurance-officer with the responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a qa program ; ( 2 ) preparation of a quality-assurance-plan with data-quality objectives ; ( 3 ) preparation of written descriptions of laboratory standard-operating-procedures ( sop 's ) for test-organism-culturing , toxicity-testing , instrument-calibration , sample-chain-of-custody , laboratory sample tracking-system , etc . ; and ( 4 ) provision of adequate , qualified technical-staff and suitable-space and equipment to assure reliable-data . 4.1.2 qa practices within an aquatic-toxicology-laboratory must address all activities that affect the quality of the final effluent-toxicity-data , such as : ( 1 ) effluent-sampling and handling ; ( 2 ) the source and condition of the test-organisms ; ( 3 ) condition and operation of equipment ; ( 4 ) test-conditions ; ( 5 ) instrument-calibration ; ( 6 ) replication ; ( 7 ) use of reference-toxicants ; ( 8 ) record keeping ; and ( 9 ) data-evaluation . 4.1.3 quality-control practices , on the other hand , consist of the more focused , routine , day-to-day-activities carried out within the scope of the overall qa program . for more detailed-discussion of quality-assurance , and general-guidance on good-laboratory practices related to toxicity-testing , see : fda , 1978 ; usepa , 1975 ; usepa , 1979a ; usepa , 1980a ; usepa , 1980b ; usepa , 1991b ; dewoskin , 1984 ; and taylor , 1987 . 4.1.4 guidance for the evaluation of laboratories performing-toxicity-tests and laboratory-evaluation-criteria may be found in usepa 1991b . 4.2 facilities , equipment , and test-chambers 4.2.1 separate-test-organism culturing and toxicity-testing-areas should be provided to avoid possible-loss of cultures due to cross-contamination . ventilation-systems should be designed and operated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemical analysis-laboratories or sample-storage and preparation-areas into organism culturing or toxicity-testing-areas , and from toxicity-test laboratories and sample-preparation-areas into culture-rooms . 4.2.2 laboratory and toxicity-test temperature-control equipment must be adequate to maintain recommended-test-water temperatures . recommended materials must be used in the fabrication of the test-equipment which comes in contact with the effluent ( see section 5 , facilities and equipment ) . 4.3 test-organisms 4.3.1 the test-organisms used in the procedures described in this manual are listed in section 6 , test-organisms . the organisms should appear healthy , behave normally , feed well , and have low-mortality in cultures , during holding , and in test-controls . test-organisms should be positively identified to species . 4.4 laboratory-water used for culturing and test-dilution-water 4.4.1 the quality of water used for test-organism-culturing and for dilution-water used in toxicity-tests is extremely-important . water for these two uses should come from the same source . the dilution-water used in effluent-toxicity-tests will depend in part on the objectives of the study and logistical-constraints , as discussed in detail in section 7 , dilution-water . the dilution-water used for internal-quality assurance tests with organisms , food , and reference-toxicants should be the water routinely used with success in the laboratory . types of water are discussed in section 5 , facilities and equipment . water used for culturing and test-dilution should be analyzed for toxic-metals and organics at least annually or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting-minimum acceptability-criteria for control-survival and reproduction or growth . the concentration of the metals , al , as , cr , co , cu , fe , pb , ni , and zn , expressed as total-metal , should not exceed 1 µg/l each , and cd , hg , and ag , expressed as total-metal , should not exceed 100 ng/l each . total-organochlorine-pesticides plus pcbs should be less than 50 ng/l ( apha , 1992 ) . pesticide-concentrations should not exceed usepa 's ambient water-quality chronic-criteria-values where available . 4.5 effluent-sampling and sample handling 4.5.1 sample holding-times and temperatures must conform to conditions described in section 8 , effluent and receiving-water sampling and sample handling . 4.6 test-conditions 4.6.1 the temperature of test-solutions must be measured by placing the thermometer or probe directly into the test-solutions , or by placing the thermometer in equivalent-volumes of water in surrogate-vessels positioned at appropriate-locations among the test-vessels . temperature should be recorded continuously in at least one vessel during the duration of each test . test-solution temperatures should be maintained within the limits specified for each test . do concentration and ph in test-chambers should be checked daily throughout the test-period , as prescribed in section 9 , acute-toxicity-test procedures . 4.7 quality of test-organisms 4.7.1 the health of test-organisms is primarily assessed by the performance ( survival , growth , and/or reproduction ) of organisms in control-treatments of individual-tests . the health and sensitivity of test-organisms is also assessed by reference-toxicant testing . in addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of test-organisms , reference-toxicant testing is used to initially demonstrate acceptable-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.14 ) and to document ongoing-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.15 ) . 4.7.2 regardless of the source of test-organisms ( in-house cultures or purchased from external-suppliers ) , the testing-laboratory must perform at least one acceptable-reference-toxicant test per month for each toxicity-test-method conducted in that month ( subsection 4.15 ) . if a test-method is conducted only monthly , or less frequently , a reference-toxicant test must be performed concurrently with each effluent-toxicity-test . 4.7.3 when acute or short-term-chronic-toxicity tests are performed with effluents or receiving-waters using-test-organisms obtained from outside the test-laboratory , concurrent-toxicity tests of the same type must be preformed with a reference-toxicant , unless the test-organism supplier provides control-chart-data from at least the last five monthly acute-toxicity-tests using the same reference-toxicant and test-conditions . 4.7.4 the supplier should also certify the species-identification of the test-organisms , and provide the taxonomic-reference ( citation and page ) or name ( s ) of the taxonomic-expert ( s ) consulted . 4.7.5 if a routine-reference toxicant-test fails to meet test-acceptability-criteria , then the reference-toxicant test must be immediately repeated . 4.8 food quality 4.8.1 the nutritional-quality of the food used in culturing and testing-fish and invertebrates is an important-factor in the quality of the toxicity-test-data . this is especially-true for the unsaturated fatty-acid-content of brine-shrimp-nauplii , artemia . suitable-trout-chow , artemia , and other foods must be obtained as described in this manual . 4.8.2 problems with the nutritional-suitability of the food will be reflected in the survival , growth , and reproduction of the test-organisms in cultures and toxicity-tests . if a batch of food is suspected to be defective , the performance of organisms fed with the new food can be compared with the performance of organisms fed with a food of known quality in side-by-side-tests . if the food is used for culturing , its suitability should be determined using a short-term-chronic-test which will determine the effect of food quality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant-test species in culture , using four replicates with each food-source . where applicable , foods used only in acute-toxicity-tests can be compared with a food of known quality in side-by-side , multi-concentration acute-tests , using the reference-toxicant regularly employed in the laboratory qa program . 4.8.3 new batches of food used in culturing and testing should be analyzed for toxic-organics and metals or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting-minimum test-acceptability-criteria for control-survival and reproduction or growth . if the concentration of total-organochlorine-pesticides exceeds 0.l5 µg/g wet-weight , or the concentration of the total-organochlorine-pesticides plus pcbs exceeds 0.30 µg/g wet-weight , or toxic-metals ( al , as , cr , co , cu , pb , ni , zn , expressed as total-metal ) exceed 20 µg/g wet-weight , the food should not be used ( for analytical-methods see aoac , 1990 and usda , 1989 ) . for foods ( e.g. , such as yct ) which are used to culture and test-organisms , the quality of food should meet the requirements for the laboratory-water used for culturing and test-dilution-water as described in section 4.4 above . 4.9 acceptability of acute-toxicity-test results 4.9.1 for the test results to be acceptable , control-survival must equal or exceed 90 % . 4.9.2 an individual-test may be conditionally-acceptable if temperature , do , and other specified-conditions fall outside specifications , depending on the degree of the departure and the objectives of the tests ( see test-condition-summaries ) . the acceptability of the test will depend on the experience and professional-judgment of the laboratory-analyst and the reviewing-staff of the regulatory-authority . any deviation from test-specifications must be noted when reporting-data from a test . 4.10 analytical-methods 4.10.1 routine-chemical and physical-analyses for culture and dilution-water , food , and test-solutions , must include established quality-assurance-practices outlined in agency methods-manuals ( usepa , 1979a ; usepa , 1993b ) . 4.10.2 reagent-containers should be dated when received from the supplier , and the shelf-life should not be exceeded . also , working-solutions should be dated when prepared , and the recommended shelf-life should be observed . 4.11 calibration and standardization 4.11.1 instruments used for routine-measurements of chemical and physical-parameters such as ph , do , temperature , conductivity , salinity , alkalinity , and hardness must be calibrated and standardized prior to use each day according to the instrument-manufacturer 's procedures as indicated in the general-section on quality-assurance ( see epa methods 150.1 , 360.1 , 170.1 , and 120.1 ; usepa , 1979b ) . calibration-data are recorded in a permanent-log . 4.11.2 wet-chemical-methods used to measure hardness , alkalinity , and total residual-chlorine must be standardized prior to use each day according to the procedures for those specific epa methods ( see epa methods 130.2 and 310.1 ; usepa 1979b ) . 4.12 replication and test-sensitivity 4.12.1 the sensitivity of toxicity-tests will depend in part on the number of replicates per concentration , the significance-level selected , and the type of statistical-analysis . if the variability remains constant , the sensitivity of the test will increase as the number of replicates is increased . the minimum recommended-number of replicates varies with the objectives of the test and the statistical-method used for analysis of the data . 4.13 variability in toxicity-test-results 4.13.1 factors which can affect test-success and precision include : the experience and skill of the laboratory-analyst ; test-organism-age , condition , and sensitivity ; dilution-water-quality ; temperature-control ; and the quality and quantity of food provided . the results will depend upon the species used and the strain or source of the test-organisms , and test-conditions such as temperature , do , food , and water-quality . the repeatability or precision of toxicity-tests is also a function of the number of test-organisms used at each toxicant-concentration . jensen ( 1972 ) discussed the relationship between sample-size ( numbers of fish ) and the standard-error of the test , and considered 20 fish per concentration as optimum for probit analysis . 4.13.2 test-precision can be estimated by using the same strain of organisms under the same test-conditions , and employing a known toxicant , such as a reference-toxicant . the single-laboratory ( intra-laboratory ) and multi-laboratory ( inter-laboratory ) precision of acute-toxicity-tests with several common-test-species and reference-toxicants are listed in tables 1-4 . intra- and inter-laboratory-precision are described by the mean , standard-deviation , and relative-standard-deviation ( percent-coefficient of variation , or cv ) of the calculated endpoints from the replicated-tests . 4.13.3 intra-laboratory-precision-data from 268 acute-toxicity-tests with four species and five reference-toxicants are listed in tables 1 and 2 . the precision , expressed as cv % , ranged from 3 % to 86 % . more recent cv values reported by jop et al . ( 1986 ) , dorn and rogers ( 1989 ) , hall et al . ( 1989 ) , and cowgill et al . ( 1990 ) , fell in a somewhat lower range ( 8 % to 41 % ) . 4.13.4 inter-laboratory-precision of acute-toxicity-tests from 253 reference-toxicant tests with seven species , listed in tables 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( expressed as cv % for lc50s ) , ranged from 11 % to 167 % . table 6 shows interlaboratory-precision-data from a study of acute-toxicity-test methods using-reference-toxicant , effluent , and receiving-water-sample types ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2001b ) . averaged across sample-types , total interlaboratory-precision ( expressed as cv % for lc50s ) ranged from 13 % to 38.5 % for the acute methods . 4.13.5 no clear-pattern of differences were noted in the intra- or inter-laboratory-test-precision with the species listed , although the test results with some toxicants , such as cadmium , appear to more variable than those with other reference-toxicants . 4.13.6 additional information on toxicity-test-precision is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxics control ( see pp . 2-4 , and 11-15 ; usepa , 1991c ) . 1 precision expressed as percent-coefficient of variation , where cv % = ( standard-deviation x 100 ) /mean . 2 sds = sodium-dodecyl ( lauryl ) sulfate ; napcp = sodium pentachlorophenate ;

( 1989 ) . zn was tested in two intralaboratory-trials and in two interlaboratory-trials . data from this study was only reported to two significant-figures . 4.14 demonstrating acceptable-laboratory-performance 4.14.1 it is a laboratory 's responsibility to demonstrate its ability to obtain consistent , precise-results with reference-toxicants before it performs toxicity-tests with effluents for permit-compliance-purposes . to meet this requirement , the intra-laboratory-precision , expressed as percent-coefficient of variation ( cv % ) , of each type of test to be used in a laboratory should be determined by performing five or more tests with different-batches of test-organisms , using the same reference-toxicant , at the same concentrations , with the same test-conditions ( i.e. , the same test-duration , type of dilution-water , age of test-organisms , feeding , etc . ) , and same data-analysis-methods . a reference-toxicant concentration-series ( 0.5 or higher ) should be selected that will consistently provide partial-mortalities at two or more concentrations . 4.15 documenting ongoing-laboratory-performance 4.15.1 satisfactory-laboratory-performance is demonstrated by performing at least one acceptable-test per month with a reference-toxicant for each toxicity-test-method conducted in the laboratory during that month . for a given test-method , successive-tests must be performed with the same reference-toxicant , at the same concentrations , in the same dilution-water , using the same data-analysis-methods . precision may vary with the test-species , reference-toxicant , and type of test . each laboratory 's reference toxicity-data will reflect conditions unique to that facility , including-dilution-water , culturing , and other variables ; however , each laboratory 's reference-toxicity-results should reflect good repeatability . 4.15.2 a control-chart should be prepared for each combination of reference-toxicant , test-species , test-condition , and endpoint . toxicity-endpoints from five or six tests are adequate for establishing the control-charts . in this technique , a running-plot is maintained for the toxicity-values ( xi ) from successive-tests with a given reference-toxicant ( figure 1 ) , and endpoints ( lc50s ) are examined to determine if they are within prescribed-limits . the types of control-charts illustrated ( see usepa , 1979a ) are used to evaluate the cumulative-trend of results from a series of samples , thus-reference toxicant-test-results should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of individual-effluent or receiving-water-tests . the mean ( ¯ ) and upper and lower control-limits ( ±2s ) are re- x calculated with each successive-test-result . after two years of data-collection , or a minimum of 20-data-points , the control-chart should be maintained using only the 20 most recent-data-points . 4.15.3 laboratories should compare the calculated cv ( i.e. , standard-deviation / mean ) of the lc50 for the 20 most recent-data-points to the distribution of laboratory-cvs reported nationally for reference-toxicant testing ( table 3-3 in usepa , 2000b ) . if the calculated cv exceeds the 75th-percentile of cvs reported nationally , the laboratory should use the 75th and 90th-percentiles to calculate warning and control-limits , respectively , and the laboratory should investigate options for reducing-variability . 4.15.4 the outliers , which are values falling outside the upper and lower control-limits , and trends of increasing or decreasing sensitivity , are readily identified . at the p0.05 probability level , one in 20 tests would be expected to fall outside of the control-limits by chance alone . if more than one out of 20 reference-toxicant tests fall outside the control-limits , the laboratory should investigate sources of variability , take corrective-actions to reduce identified sources of variability , and perform an additional-reference toxicant-test during the same month . in those instances when the laboratory can document the cause for the outlier ( e.g. , operator-error , culture-health or test-system failure ) , the outlier should be excluded from the future calculations of the control-limits . if two or more consecutive-tests do not fall within the control-limits , the results must be explained and the reference-toxicant test must be immediately repeated . actions taken to correct the problem must be reported . 4.15.5 if the toxicity-value from a given test with the reference-toxicant falls well outside the expected-range for the test-organisms when using the standard-dilution-water , the laboratory should investigate sources of variability , take corrective-actions to reduce identified sources of variability , and perform an additional-reference toxicant-test during the same month . performance should improve with experience , and the control-limits for point-estimates should gradually narrow . however , control-limits of ±2s , by definition , will be exceeded 5 % of the time , regardless of how well a laboratory performs . highly proficient-laboratories which develop a very narrow-control-limit may be unfairly penalized if a test which falls just outside the control-limits is rejected de facto . for this reason , the width of the control-limits should be considered in determining whether or not a reference-toxicant test-result falls `` well '' outside the expected-range . the width of the control-limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated cv ( i.e. , standard-deviation / mean ) of the lc50 for the 20 most recent-data-points to the distribution of laboratory-cvs reported nationally for reference-toxicant testing ( table 3-3 in usepa , 2000b ) . in determining whether or not a reference-toxicant test-result falls `` well '' outside the expected-range , the result also may be compared with upper and lower bounds for ±3s , as any result outside these control-limits would be expected to occur by chance only 1 out of 100 tests ( environment canada , 1990 ) . when a result from a reference-toxicant test is outside the 99 % confidence-intervals , the laboratory must conduct an immediate-investigation to assess the possible-causes for the outlier . 4.15.6 reference-toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of individual-effluent or receiving-water-tests . reference-toxicant testing is used for evaluating the health and sensitivity of organisms over time and for documenting initial and ongoing-laboratory-performance . while reference-toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto criterion for test-rejection , effluent and receiving-water-test results should be reviewed and interpreted in the light of reference-toxicant test results . the reviewer should consider the degree to which the reference-toxicant test-result fell outside of control-chart-limits , the width of the limits , the direction of the deviation ( toward increased test-organism sensitivity or toward decreased-test organism-sensitivity ) , the test-conditions of both the effluent-test and the reference-toxicant test , and the objective of the test . 4.16 reference-toxicants 4.16.1 reference-toxicants such as sodium-chloride ( nacl ) , potassium-chloride ( kcl ) , cadmium-chloride ( cdcl2 ) , copper-sulfate ( cuso4 ) , sodium-dodecyl-sulfate ( sds ) , and potassium-dichromate ( k2cr2o7 ) , are suitable for use in the npdes and other agency-programs requiring aquatic-toxicity-tests . emsl-cincinnati hopes to release epacertified-solutions of cadmium and copper , with accompanying-toxicity-data for the recommended test-species , for use as reference-toxicants through cooperative-research and development-agreements with commercial-suppliers , and will continue to develop additional-reference-toxicants for future-release . standard reference-materials can be obtained from commercial-supply-houses , or can be prepared-inhouse using-reagent grade-chemicals . the regulatory-agency should be consulted before reference-toxicant ( s ) are selected and used . 4.17 record keeping 4.17.1 proper-record keeping is important . a complete-file should be maintained for each individual-toxicity-test or group of tests on closely related samples . this file should contain a record of the sample-chain-of-custody ; a copy of the sample-log-sheet ; the original-bench-sheets for the test-organism-responses during the toxicity-test ( s ) ; chemical-analysis-data on the sample ( s ) ; detailed records of the test-organisms used in the test ( s ) , such as species , source , age , date of receipt , and other pertinent-information relating to their history and health ; information on the calibration of equipment and instruments ; test-conditions employed ; and results of reference-toxicant tests . laboratory-data should be recorded on a real-time-basis to prevent the loss of information or inadvertent-introduction of errors into the record . original-data sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory-personnel performing the tests . 4.17.2 the regulatory-authority should retain records pertaining to discharge-permits . permittees are required to retain records pertaining to permit-applications and compliance for a minimum of 3 years [ 40 cfr 122.41 ( j ) ( 2 ) ] . facilities and equipment 5.1 general requirements 5.1.1 effluent-toxicity-tests may be performed in a fixed or mobile-laboratory . facilities should include equipment for rearing and/or holding-organisms . 5.1.2 the facilities must be well ventilated and free of toxic-fumes . sample preparation , culturing , and toxicity-testing-areas should be separated to avoid cross-contamination of cultures or toxicity-test-solutions with toxic-fumes . laboratory-ventilation-systems should be checked to ensure that return-air from chemistry-laboratories and/or sample handling-areas is not circulated to test-organism culture-rooms or toxicity-test-rooms , or that air from toxicity-test-rooms does not contaminate-culture-areas . air-pressure differentials between such rooms should not result in a net-flow of potentially contaminated air to sensitive-areas through open or loosely-fitting-doors . 5.1.3 control of test-solution-temperature can best be achieved using circulating-water-baths , heat-exchangers , or environmental-chambers . photoperiod can be controlled using automatic-timers in the laboratory or environmental-chambers . 5.1.4 water used for rearing , holding , and testing-organisms may be reconstituted synthetic-water , ground-water , surface-water , or dechlorinated-tap-water . dechlorination can be accomplished by carbon-filtration , laboratory-water conditioning units , or the use of sodium-thiosulfate . after dechlorination , total residual-chlorine should be non-detectable . sodium-thiosulfate may be toxic to the test-organisms , and if used for dechlorination , paired controls with and without sodium-thiosulfate should be incorporated in effluent-toxicity-tests . use of 3.6 mg ( anhydrous ) sodium thiosulfate/l will reduce l.0 mg chlorine/l . after dechlorination , total residual-chlorine should be non-detectable . 5.1.4.1 a good-quality , laboratory-grade deionized-water , providing a resistance of 18 megaohm-cm , must be available in the laboratory and in sufficient-quantity for laboratory-needs . deionized-water may be obtained from millipore® , milli-q® , millipore qpaktm2 or equivalent-system . if large-quantities of high quality deionized-water are needed , it may be advisable to supply the laboratory-grade water deionizer with preconditioned-water from a culligan® , continental® , or equivalent , mixed-bed-water-treatment system . 5.1.5 air used for aeration must be free of oil and fumes . oil-free air-pumps should be used where possible . particulates can be removed from the air using balston® grade bx or equivalent-filters ( balston , inc. , lexington , ma ) , and oil and other organic-vapors can be removed using activated carbon-filters ( balston® , c-1 filter , or equivalent ) . 5.1.6 during rearing , holding , and testing , test-organisms should be shielded from external-disturbances such as rapidly changing light-conditions ( especially-salmonids ) and pedestrian traffic . 5.1.7 materials used for exposure-chambers , tubing , etc. , that come in contact with the effluent and dilution-water should be carefully chosen . tempered glass and perfluorocarbon-plastics ( teflon® ) should be used whenever possible to minimize sorption and leaching of toxic-substances , and may be reused after cleaning . containers made of plastics , such as polyethylene , polypropylene , polyvinyl-chloride , tygon® , etc. , may be used to ship , store , and transfer effluents and receiving-waters , but they should not be reused unless absolutely-necessary , because they could carry over adsorbed-toxicants from one test to another . however , these containers may be repeatedly reused for storing-uncontaminated waters such as deionized or laboratory-prepared-dilution-waters and receiving-waters . glass or disposable-polystyrene-containers can be used as test-chambers . the use of large ( $ 20 l ) glass-carboys is discouraged for safety-reasons . 5.1.8 new plastic-products should be tested for toxicity before general-use by exposing-organisms to them under ordinary-test conditions . 5.1.9 equipment which can not be discarded after each use because of cost , must be decontaminated according to the cleaning procedures listed below . fiberglass , in addition to the previously mentioned-materials , can be used for holding and dilution-water storage-tanks , and in the water-delivery-system . all material should be flushed or rinsed thoroughly with dilution-water before using in the test . 5.1.10 copper , galvanized-material , rubber , brass , and lead must not come in contact with holding or dilution-water , or with effluent-samples and test-solutions . some materials , such as neoprene-rubber ( commonly used for stoppers ) , may be toxic and should be tested before use . 5.1.11 silicone-adhesive used to construct glass-test-chambers absorbs some organochlorine and organophosphorus-pesticides , which are difficult to remove . therefore , as little of the adhesive as possible should be in contact with water . extra-beads of adhesive inside the containers should be removed . 5.2 cleaning test-chambers and laboratory apparatus 5.2.1 new plasticware used for effluent or dilution-water-collection or organism-test-chambers does not require thorough-cleaning before use . it is sufficient to rinse new sample-containers once with sample-dilution-water before use . new glassware must be soaked overnight in 10 % acid ( see below ) and rinsed well in deionized-water and dilution-water . 5.2.2 all non-disposable-sample-containers , test-vessels , tanks , and other equipment that has come in contact with effluent must be washed after use in the manner described below to remove surface-contaminants as described below : 1 . soak 15 min in tap-water , and scrub with detergent , or clean in an automatic-dishwasher . 2 . rinse twice with tap-water . 3 . carefully rinse once with fresh , dilute ( 10 % , v : v ) hydrochloric or nitric-acid to remove scale , metals , and bases . to prepare a 10 % solution of acid , add 10 ml of concentrated-acid to 90 ml of deionized-water . 4 . rinse twice with deionized-water . 5 . rinse once with full-strength , pesticide-grade-acetone to remove organic-compounds ( use a fume-hood or canopy ) . 6 . rinse three times with deionized-water . 5.2.3 all test-chambers and equipment should be thoroughly rinsed with the dilution-water immediately prior to use in each test . 5.3 apparatus and equipment for culturing and toxicity-tests 5.3.1 culture units -- see appendix . it is preferable to obtain test-organisms from in-house-culture-units . if it is not feasible to maintain cultures in-house , test-organisms can be obtained from commercial-sources , and should be shipped to the laboratory in well oxygenated-water in insulated containers to minimize excursions in water-temperature during shipment . the temperature of the water in the shipping-containers should be measured on arrival , to determine if the organisms were subjected to obvious undue thermal stress . 5.3.2 samplers -- automatic-samplers , preferably with sample cooling-capability , that can collect a 24-h composite-sample of 2 l or more . 5.3.3 sample-containers -- for sample-shipment and storage ( see section 8 , effluent and receiving-water sampling and sample handling ) . 5.3.4 environmental chamber or equivalent-facility with temperature-control ( 20ec or 25ec ) 5.3.5 water purification-system -- millipore® milli-q® , millipore® qpak™2 , or equivalent . depending on the quantity of high grade-water needed , a first-stage-pre-conditioner-deionizer , such as a culligan® or continental® system , or equivalent , may be needed to provide feed-water to the high-purity-system . 5.3.6 balance -- analytical , capable of accurately weighing to 0.0001 g. 5.3.7 reference-weights , class s -- for documenting the performance of the analytical-balance ( s ) . the balance ( s ) should be checked with reference-weights which are at the upper and lower ends of the range of the weighings made when the balance is used . a balance should be checked at the beginning of each series of weighings , periodically ( such as every tenth-weight ) during a long series of weighings , and after the last-weight of a series is taken . 5.3.8 test-chambers -- borosilicate-glass or non-toxic disposable plastic-test chambers are suitable . test-chamber volumes are indicated in the method-summaries . to avoid potential contamination from the air and excessive-evaporation of test-solutions during the test , the chambers should be covered with safety-glass-plates or sheet-plastic , 6 mm ( ¼ in ) thick . 5.3.9 volumetric-flasks and graduated-cylinders -- class a , borosilicate-glass or non-toxic-plastic-labware , 10-1000 ml for making-test-solutions . 5.3.10 volumetric-pipets -- class a , 1-100 ml . 5.3.11 serological-pipets -- 1-10 ml , graduated . 5.3.12 pipet-bulbs and fillers -- propipet® , or equivalent . 5.3.13 droppers , and glass tubing with fire polished edges , 4 mm id -- for transferring-test-organisms . 5.3.14 wash bottles -- for rinsing small-glassware and instrument-electrodes and probes . 5.3.15 glass or electronic-thermometers -- for measuring-water temperature . 5.3.16 bulb-thermograph or electronic-chart-type-thermometers -- for continuously recording-temperature . 5.3.17 national bureau of standards certified thermometer ( see usepa method 170.1 ; usepa 1979b ) . 5.3.18 ph , do , and specific-conductivity-meters -- for routine physical and chemical-measurements . unless the test is being conducted to specifically measure the effect of one of the above parameters , a portable , field-grade-instrument is acceptable . 5.3.19 refractometer -- for measuring effluent , receiving , and test-solution-salinity . 5.3.20 amperometric-titrator -- for measuring total residual-chlorine . 5.4 reagents and consumable-materials 5.4.1 reagent-water -- defined as millipore® milli-q® , millipore® qpak™2 or equivalent-water ( see subsection 5.3.5 above ) . 5.4.2 effluent , dilution-water , and receiving-water -- see section 7 , dilution-water , and section 8 , effluent and receiving-water sampling and sample handling . 5.4.3 reagents for hardness and alkalinity-tests ( see usepa methods 130.2 and 310.1 ; usepa l979b ) . 5.4.4 standard ph buffers 4 , 7 , and 10 ( or as per instructions of instrument-manufacturer ) for instrument-calibration ( see usepa method 150.1 ; usepa 1979b ) .

modified winkler analysis . 5.4.9 sources of food for cultures and toxicity-tests . 5.4.9.1 all food should be tested for nutritional-suitability , and chemically analyzed for organic-chlorine , pcbs , and toxic-metals ( see section 4 , quality-assurance ) . 5.4.9.2 brine-shrimp ( artemia ) -- see appendix a . 1 . brine-shrimp ( artemia ) cysts . there are many commercial-sources of brine-shrimp-cysts . the quality of the cysts may vary from one batch to another , and the cysts in each new batch ( can or lot ) should be evaluated for nutritional-suitability and chemical-contamination . the nutritional-suitability ( see leger et al. , 1985 , 1986 ) of each new batch is checked against known suitable-reference-cysts by performing a side-by-side-growth and/or reproduction-tests using the `` new '' and '' reference '' cysts . if the results of tests for nutritional-suitability or chemical-contamination do not meet standards , the artemia should not be used . 2 . frozen-adult brine-shrimp frozen-adult brine-shrimp are available from pet-stores and other commercial-sources . 5.4.9.3 trout-chow starter or no . 1 pellets , prepared according to current u.s . fish and wildlife service specifications , are available from commercial-sources . ( the flake-food , tetramin® or bioril® , can be used regularly as a substitute for trout-chow in preparing-food for daphnids , and can be used as a short-term-substitute for trout-chow in feeding-fathead-minnows . ) 5.4.9.4 dried , powdered-leaves ( cerophyll® ) dried , powdered , cereal-leaves ( e.g. , cerophyll® or equivalent ) are available from commercial-suppliers . dried , powdered , alfalfa leaves obtained from health-food-stores have been found to be a satisfactory-substitute for cereal-leaves . 5.4.9.5 yeast packaged dry-yeast , such as fleischmann 's , or equivalent , can be purchased at the local-grocery-store . 5.4.9.6 flake-fish-food the flake-foods , tetramin® and bioril® , are available at most pet-supply-shops . 5.5 test-organisms 5.5.1 test-organisms are obtained from inhouse-cultures or commercial-suppliers ( see section 6 , test-organisms ) . test-organisms 6.1 test-species 6.1.1 the species used in characterizing the acute-toxicity of effluents and/or receiving-waters will depend on the requirements of the regulatory-authority and the objectives of the test . it is essential that good-quality test-organisms be readily-available throughout the year from inhouse or commercial-sources to meet npdes monitoring-requirements . the organisms used in toxicity-tests must be identified to species . if there is any doubt as to the identity of the test-organisms , representative-specimens should be sent to a taxonomic-expert to confirm the identification . 6.1.2 toxicity-test-conditions and culture-methods are provided in this manual for the following-principal-test organisms : freshwater-organisms : 1 . ceriodaphnia-dubia ( daphnid ) ( table 12 ) . 2 . daphnia-pulex and d. magna ( daphnids ) ( table 13 ) . 3 . pimephales promelas ( fathead-minnow ) ( table 14 ) . 4 . oncorhynchus-mykiss ( rainbow-trout ) and salvelinus fontinalis ( brook-trout ) ( table 15 ) . estuarine and marine-organisms : 1 . mysidopsis-bahia ( mysid ) ( table 16 ) .1 2 . cyprinodon-variegatus ( sheepshead-minnow ) ( table 17 ) . 3 . menidia-beryllina ( inland-silverside ) , m. menidia ( atlantic silverside ) , and m. peninsulae ( tidewater-silverside ) ( table 18 ) . 6.1.3 the test-species ( afs , 1991 ) listed in subsection 6.1.2 are the recommended acute-toxicity-test organisms . they are easily-cultured in the laboratory , are sensitive to a variety of pollutants , and are generally-available throughout the year from commercial-sources . summaries of test-conditions for these species are provided in tables 12-18 . guidelines for culturing and/or holding the organisms are provided in appendix a . 6.1.4 additional-species may be suitable for toxicity-tests in the npdes program . a list of alternative acute-toxicity-test species and minimal-testing-requirements ( i.e. , temperature , salinity , and life-stage ) for these species are provided in appendix b . table 19 provides a summary of test-conditions for holmesimysis-costata , which should also be considered an alternative acute-toxicity-test species . the holmesimysis-costata acute-test ( table 19 ) is specific to pacific coast waters and is not listed at 40 cfr part 136 for nationwide-use . it is important to note that these species may not be as easily-cultured or tested as the species on the list in 6.1.2 , and may not be available from commercial-sources . 6.1.5 some states have developed culturing and testing-methods for indigenous-species that may be as sensitive or more sensitive than the species recommended in 6.1.2 . however , epa allows the use of indigenous-species only where state-regulations require their use or prohibit importation of the species in 6.1.2 . where state-regulations prohibit importation or use of the recommended test-species , permission must be requested from the appropriate-state-agency prior to their use . 1 the genus-name of this organism was formally changed to americamysis ( price et al. , 1994 ) ; however , the method-manual will continue to refer to mysidopsis-bahia to maintain consistency with previous-versions of the method . 6.1.6 where states have developed culturing and testing-methods for indigenous-species other than those recommended in this manual , data comparing the sensitivity of the substitute-species and one or more of the recommended-species must be obtained in side-by-side toxicity-tests with reference-toxicants and/or effluents , to ensure that the species selected are at least as sensitive as the recommended-species . these data must be submitted to the permitting-authority ( state or region ) if required . epa acknowledges that reference-toxicants prepared from pure-chemicals may not always be representative of effluents . however , because of the observed and/or potential-variability in the quality and toxicity of effluents , it is not possible to specify a representative effluent . 6.1.7 guidance for the selection of test-organisms where the salinity of the effluent and/or receiving-water requires special-consideration is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxics control ( usepa , 1991c ) . 1 . where the salinity of the receiving-water is < 1‰ , freshwater-organisms are used regardless of the salinity of the effluent . 2 . where the salinity of the receiving-water is $ 1‰ , the choice of organisms depends on state water-quality standards and/or permit-requirements . 6.2 sources of test-organisms 6.2.1 inhouse-cultures 6.2.1.1 inhouse-cultures should be established wherever it is cost effective . if inhouse-cultures can not be maintained , test-organisms should be purchased from experienced commercial-suppliers ( see appendix for sources ) . 6.2.2 commercial-suppliers 6.2.2.1 all of the principal-test-organisms listed in subsection 6.1.2 are available from commercial-suppliers . 6.2.3 feral ( natural occurring , wild caught ) organisms 6.2.3.1 the use of test-organisms taken from the receiving-water has strong-appeal , and would seem to be the logical-approach . however , it is impractical for the following-reasons : 1 . sensitive-organisms may not be present in the receiving-water because of previous-exposure to the effluent or other pollutants . 2 . it is often-difficult to collect organisms of the required-age and quality from the receiving-water ; 3 . most states require collection-permits , which may be difficult to obtain . therefore , it is usually more cost effective to culture the organisms in the laboratory or obtain them from private , state , or federal-sources . fish such as fathead-minnows , sheepshead-minnows , and silversides , and invertebrates such as daphnids and mysids , are easily reared in the laboratory or purchased . 4 . the required qa/qc records , such as the single-laboratory-precision data , would not be available . 5 . since it is mandatory that the identity of test-organisms is known to the species-level , it would necessary to examine each organism caught in the wild to confirm its identity , which would usually be impractical or , at the least , very stressful to the organisms . 6 . test-organisms obtained from the wild must be observed in the laboratory for a minimum of one week prior to use , to assure that they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial-infections and other adverse-effects . fish captured by electroshocking must not be used in toxicity-testing . 6.2.3.2 guidelines for collection of feral-organisms are provided in usepa , 1973 ; usepa 1990a . 6.2.4 regardless of their source , test-organisms should be carefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stress and disease , and in good physical-condition . some species of test-organisms , such as trout , can be obtained from stocks certified as '' disease-free . '' 6.3 life-stage 6.3.1 young-organisms are often more sensitive to toxicants than are adults . for this reason , the use of early-life-stages , such as first instars of daphnids and juvenile-mysids and fish , is required for all tests . in a given test , all organisms should be approximately the same age and should be taken from the same source . since age may affect the results of the tests , it would enhance the value and comparability of the data if the same species in the same life-stages were used throughout a monitoring-program at a given facility . 6.4 laboratory culturing 6.4.1 instructions for culturing and/or holding the recommended-test-organisms are included in appendix a . 6.5 holding and handling test-organisms 6.5.1 test-organisms should not be subjected to changes of more than 3ec in water-temperature or 3‰ in salinity in any 12 h period . 6.5.2 organisms should be handled as little as possible . when handling is necessary , it should be done as gently , carefully , and quickly as possible to minimize stress . organisms that are dropped or touch dry-surfaces or are injured during handling must be discarded . dipnets are best for handling larger organisms . these nets are commercially-available or can be made from small-mesh nylon-netting , silk bolting-cloth , plankton-netting , or similar material . wide-bore , smooth-glass-tubes ( 4 to 8 mm inside diameter ) with rubber-bulbs or pipettors ( such as a propipette® or other pipettor ) should be used for transferring smaller organisms such as daphnids , mysids , and larval-fish . 6.5.3 holding-tanks for fish are supplied with a good-quality water ( see section 5 , facilities and equipment ) with a flow-through-rate of at least two tank-volumes per day . otherwise , use a recirculation-system where the water flows through an activated carbon or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolites . culture-water can also be piped through high intensity-ultraviolet light-sources for disinfection , and to photodegrade dissolved organics . 6.5.4 crowding should be avoided . the do must be maintained at a minimum of 4.0 mg/l for marine and warm-water , freshwater-species , and 6.0 mg/l for cold-water , freshwater-species . the solubility of oxygen depends on temperature , salinity , and altitude . aerate if necessary . 6.5.5 fish should be fed as much as they will eat at least once a day with live or frozen-brine shrimp or dry-food ( frozen-food should be completely thawed before use ) . brine-shrimp can be supplemented with commercially prepared-food such as tetramin® or bioril® flake-food , or equivalent . excess food and fecal-material should be removed from the bottom of the tanks at least twice a week by siphoning . 6.5.6 fish should be observed carefully each day for signs of disease , stress , physical-damage , and mortality . dead and abnormal specimens should be removed as soon as observed . it is not uncommon to have some fish ( 5-10 % ) mortality during the first 48 h in a holding-tank because of individuals that refuse to feed on artificial-food and die of starvation . 6.5.7 a daily-record of feeding , behavioral-observations , and mortality should be maintained . 6.6 transportation to the test-site 6.6.1 organisms are transported from the base or supply laboratory to a remote-test-site in culture-water or standard-dilution-water in plastic-bags or large-mouth-screw-cap ( 500 ml ) plastic-bottles in styrofoam-coolers . adequate do is maintained by replacing the air above the water in the bags with oxygen from a compressed gas-cylinder , and sealing the bags . another method commonly used to maintain sufficient do during shipment is to aerate with an airstone which is supplied from a portable-pump . the do concentration must not fall below 4.0 mg/l for marine and warm-water , freshwater-species , and 6.0 mg/l for cold-water , freshwater-species . 6.6.2 upon arrival at the test-site , organisms are transferred to receiving-water if receiving-water is to be used as the test-dilution-water . all but a small-volume of the holding-water ( approximately 5 % ) is removed by siphoning , and replaced slowly over a 10 to 15-min-period with dilution-water . if receiving-water is used as dilution-water , caution must be exercised in exposing the test-organisms to it , because of the possibility that it might be toxic . for this reason , it is recommended that only approximately 10 % of the test-organisms be exposed initially to the dilution-water . if this group does not show excessive-mortality or obvious-signs of stress in a few hours , the remainder of the test-organisms are transferred to the dilution-water . 6.6.3 a group of organisms must not be used for a test if they appear to be unhealthy , discolored , or otherwise stressed , or if mortality appears to exceed 10 % preceding the test . if the organisms fail to meet these criteria , the entire-group must be discarded and a new group obtained . the mortality may be due to the presence of toxicity , if receiving-water is used as dilution-water , rather than a diseased-condition of the test-organisms . if the acclimation-process is repeated with a new group of test-organisms and excessive-mortality occurs , it is recommended that an alternative-source of dilution-water be used . 6.6.4 in static-tests , marine-organisms can be used at all concentrations of effluent by adjusting the salinity of the effluent to a standard-salinity ( such as 25‰ ) or to the salinity approximating that of the receiving-water , by adding sufficient dry-ocean-salts , such as forty fathoms® , or equivalent , gp2 or hypersaline-brine . 6.6.5 saline-dilution-water can be prepared with deionized-water or a freshwater such as well water or a suitable-surface water . if dry-ocean-salts are used , care must be taken to ensure that the added salts are completely dissolved and the solution is aerated 24 h before the test-organisms are placed in the solutions . the test-organisms should be acclimated in synthetic-saline-water prepared with the dry-salts . caution : addition of dry-ocean-salts to dilution-water may result in an increase in ph . ( the ph of estuarine and coastal-saline-waters is normally 7.5-8.3 . ) 6.6.6 all effluent-concentrations and the control ( s ) used in a test should have the same salinity . however , if this is impractical because of the large-volumes of water required , such as in flow-through-tests , the highest effluent-concentration ( lowest salinity ) that could be tested would depend upon the salinity of the receiving-water and the tolerance of the test-organisms . the required salinities for toxicity-tests with estuarine and marine-species are listed in tables 16-19 . however , the tolerances of other candidate-test-species would have to be determined by the investigator in advance of the test . 6.6.7 because of the circumstances described above , when performing flow-through-tests of effluents discharged to saline waters , it is advisable to acclimate-groups of test-organisms to each of three different-salinities , such as 10 , 20 , and 30‰ , prior to transporting them to the test-site . it may also be advisable to maintain cultures of these test-organisms at a series of salinity levels , including at least 10 , 20 , and 30‰ , so that the change in salinity upon acclimation at the desired test-dilutions does not exceed 6‰ . 6.7 test-organism disposal 6.7.1 when the toxicity-test is concluded , all test-organisms ( including-controls ) should be humanely destroyed and disposed of in an appropriate-manner .
