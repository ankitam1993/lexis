center could help you defend yourself in court by russell lissau daily herald staff writer posted on june 27 , 2002 representing yourself in court can be a tricky-endeavor . there are confusing legal-terms to learn , strict-procedures to follow and volumes of case-law that often need to be understood to prepare a case . lake county officials and a private-agency that assists indigent-litigants in illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help-center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal-matters . the center , which will be housed in the law-library at the main courthouse in waukegan , could open later this summer . `` i think it 's going to be extremely-helpful , '' court administrator bob zastany said . `` there is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource . '' the self-help-center will be the only one of its kind in the county . only a few operate nationwide , officials said . the project is the work of lake county circuit-court-officials and prairie state legal-services , a statewide-agency with an office in waukegan that provides information and legal-assistance to poor and elderly illinois residents . the organization has received a $ 25,000 grant from the illinois equal-justice foundation , a nonprofit-group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal-information and assistance , to help pay for the effort . prairie state will share the money with the county . the county 's law-library is on the first floor of the governmental-center at 18 n. county st . the new self-help-center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court , an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing . `` some people can do ok on their own , and some people can do ok with some help , '' said linda rothnagel , the managing-attorney for prairie state legal-services . `` but other people ca n't do it . it's not always-easy . '' self-representation is a right affirmed by the u.s. supreme court . the practice is far more common in civil-matters than in criminal-cases . in fact , self-represented-litigants - formally called `` pro se '' in latin , or `` for oneself '' - in criminal-defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept , legal-experts say . among the civil-cases most likely to feature pro se litigants are divorce , personal-injury and eviction-disputes . people represent themselves in court for a variety of reasons , with one of the biggest being financial-concerns . according to a 1991 survey by the american bar-association , people who make less than $ 50,000 a year are more likely to represent themselves than wealthier litigants . however , about 20 percent of self-represented-litigants say they can afford an attorney but do not want one , the survey said . many how-to-books are available on the subject of self-representation , and the internet is loaded with resources about pro-se-litigation . lake county 's self-help-center will help pro se litigants locate those resources and apply them to their cases , proponents said . the space , which zastany hopes to open by sept. 1 , will feature computers that will give patrons-access to case-histories , legal glossaries and other information through the internet and cd-roms . it also will have paper-documents that often are used in court-proceedings , as well as a special-telephone-line that will help people who speak languages other than english get the information they need . a county-employee will be on hand to assist litigants with their research as well . zastany said the center will demystify the judicial-process for many people . `` we 're bringing these services directly to the people who need it , '' he said
