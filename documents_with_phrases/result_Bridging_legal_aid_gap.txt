the san diego union-tribune bridging the legal-aid access gap karen a. lash and earl johnson jr. tuesday , december 10 , 2002 lash is associate-dean at the university of southern california law-school . johnson is a justice on california 's second district-court of appeal . lash and johnson are co-chairs of the california commission on access to justice . the full-report can be viewed at ( www.calbar.org ) . in her year-long-odyssey through the california justice-system , katherine , a 35-year-old single-mother with three children , experienced-failure at every turn . leaving her abusive-husband , she moved into the only apartment she could afford , and soon discovered a broken-toilet and non- working-oven , rats and roaches , and a fourthfloor-landing with no railing . she began withholding-rent pending-repairs her landlord refused to make , but then her medi-cal-benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent-receipts . she lost-health-care for her children and herself , although she is a borderline-diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat-bites . katherine tried to seek help through the courts . representing herself at an administrative-hearing , she lost her appeal to restore medi-cal-benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent-account . when she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord , she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home . according to `` the path to justice : a five-year status-report on access to justice in california , '' prepared by the california commission on access to justice , katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor-californians whose basic civil legal-needs -- often involving such critical-needs as housing , health care , education , employment , safety and transportation -- are not being addressed . california has a critical-dearth of legal-services for the poor , and , as this report makes clear , it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private-funders to increase resources so that all californians , regardless of income , have equal-access to our justice-system . our justice-system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal-system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us . unfortunately , the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal-services . california does have a strong-network of legal-aid-organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor , but there 's just one legal-aid-lawyer available per 10,000 poor-people . we may promise '' justice for all , '' but for those who ca n't afford a lawyer , that promise is often a lie . in its new report , the commission on access to justice notes some significant-steps toward providing equal-access to justice for all californians . in 1999 , thanks to gov . gray davis and leaders in the legislature , the state committed $ 10 million a year to legal-aid for the poor . in addition , california supreme court chief-justice ronald george made `` access to justice '' issues a top priority , and a growing-community of judicial , legal and civic leaders committed to expanding legal-aid is working to ensure that what little-funding is available is used in the most efficient way possible . but resources are extremely-limited . the combined federal and state-government-support in california is at $ 84.5 million on legal-aid for the poor -- just $ 13.20 per poor-person . the commission on access to justice says that government-investment would have to triple to match the investment made by comparable-states and the combined public/private investment must reach $ 533 million to adequately meet the legal-needs of the poor . that may sound beyond financial-reach , but it is actually only 2 percent of the amount californians spend on lawyers each year -- and that 2 percent would be providing legal-assistance to nearly 20 percent of the population . this is n't a controversial-issue . close to nine in 10 americans ( 89 percent ) agree that legal-help for civil-matters should be provided for low-income-people , according to the commission's report . eight in 10 people even support the idea when it is described as a government-funded-program . indeed , in many states throughout the country , government-funding for lega l aid doubles or triples that of california . and democratic-governments throughout the world have recognized that government-funding for lawyers is as critical to a fair legal-system as are judges , courts and laws . for a state whose economy is the sixth largest in the world , california should certainly be able to adequately fund free civil legal-aid . more funding and more resources for legal-services for the poor must be a statewide-priority . recent-achievements -- new government-funding , a growing-community of legal-aid-advocates -- demonstrate that the goal of equal-access to justice for all californians is achievable and that the public as well as key-leaders throughout the state will support the effort . the statistics might seem cold , but it 's impossib le to remain complacent after meeting-someone like katherine -- or a family who has been left homeless by an illegal-eviction , a senior who lost his home to foreclosure from a crooked-loan-transaction , or a domestic-violence-victim unable to navigate the courts to get a restraining-order . california can -and must -- do better .
