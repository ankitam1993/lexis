the state of pro-bono 2001 elizabeth amon staff reporter sept. 11 cast a pall over 2001 , but it led to a high point in lawyers ' efforts to give back to the community . more than 2,500 lawyers in the new york and washington , d.c. , areas have helped affected families and small-business-owners through local-bar-groups . and the association of trial lawyers of america has moved to assist families free of charge when they go file for federal-aid . the pages that follow describe the work of those and other recipients of the national law journal 's pro-bono awards for 2001 . but what about the months before sept. 11 ? from all the indicators available , the record is mixed at best . at the 106 firms that reported their pro-bono hours to the nlj in the past two years , the number dropped from 3.28 % to 3.06 % of billable-hours . that number is high -- the american bar-association suggests 3 % as a goal -- but the drop appears significant and it's arguable that the firms reporting seem likely to be the ones donating the most . though it is a small-percentage , the difference represents thousands of hours . at a 300-lawyer firm , it would translate into about 1,300 hours a year , more than half a hard-working-lawyer 's billable-time . esther lardent , president of the pro-bono institute , administers its pro-bono challenge , which confidentially tracks big law firms' pro-bono-work . the data for 2001 are n't tallied , but she says the numbers appear flat . `` we have some firms that are strong and some firms that have struggled , '' she says . the key to a commitment to pro-bono , lardent says , is a firm's stance on whether pro-bono-work counts internally as billable-hours . `` firms that are giving billable-hour-parity for pro-bono-work and showing that they mean it are the firms that are strong , '' she says . there 's no count of pro-bono contributions of solo-practitioners or midsize and small-firms . but by one measure , it seems to have been static . the legal-services corp. ( lsc ) , which works with attorneys representing poor-people , has n't tallied this year 's numbers , says mauricio-vivero vice-president of public-affairs , but he expects them to be flat . that would follow a sharp-decline a year earlier . from 1999 to 2000 the number of pro-bono-cases handled by lsc-affiliated-attorneys dropped by 20,000 , led by a drop in texas of 7,200 . still , solo-practitioners , like tallahassee , fla. 's karen gievers , continue to distinguish themselves . award-winner gievers has worked more than 1,000 hours on behalf of foster-children in florida . lawyers in death-penalty-work say they 've seen a drop in volunteerism . capital cases are expensive and demanding , and those involved in placing-attorneys on them say large-firms in particular have shied away from them . `` it 's a real-crisis , '' says robin maher , director of the american bar-association pro-bono death penalty representation project . `` in alabama alone , there are 30 people on death-row who do n't have lawyers . '' one lawyer who has fought a capital-conviction for years is award-winner jonell thomas , a las vegas solo-practitioner . she's worked more than 2,500 hours and counting on behalf of john mazzan , who was on nevada 's death-row for 20 years before his release . also noteworthy is minnesota 's lindquist & vennum , whose charles j. lloyd and steven m. pincus represented albert ronnie burrell . wrongfully convicted of the murder of an elderly-couple , burrell spent 13 years on louisiana 's death-row before being released last year . james h. schropp , a washington partner at new york 's fried , frank , harris , shriver & jacobson , represented max soffar , a texas inmate whose capital-murder-conviction was reversed after 21 years . and edwin s. matthews jr. of coudert brothers in new york represented don paradis , who was released from prison after 14 years on death-row in idaho . paradis wo n't be retried . unpopular-clients taking unpopular-clients and controversial-cases is another measure of commitment . award-winner kathleen t. zellner of naperville , ill. 's zellner & associates secured the release of three men sentenced to life for the 1986 rape of a chicago medical student . in 2001 , she spent 800 hours of pro-bono time and $ 50,000 of her own money on an appeal based on dna-evidence . david lubitz of d.c. 's swidler berlin shereff friedman , challenged an annapolis , md. , ordinance allowing the police to eject-people from designated `` drug-loitering-free-zones . '' lubitz' demonstrated that the law targeted predominantly-minority populations . the court found it unconstitutional . in philadelphia , pepper hamilton 's david richman spent 18 years in litigation with the city over its prisons . in a class-action that concluded in a settlement at the end of 2000 , he succeeded in changing the oppressive-conditions of confinement in philadelphia's prisons . among the nominations for the nlj 's award were a number of lawyers who performed significant pro-bono-work that helped nonprofit-organizations provide legal-services to the needy . alan sullivan of the salt lake city office of phoenix 's snell & wilmer has spent countless pro-bono hours since 1998 helping to increase the proportion of lawyers who donate to utah public-interest-law organizations from 5 % to 36 % . an important-figure in atlanta is terry walsh of alston & bird , who has championed the welfare of children in georgia . not only has he helped set up organizations to provide services for children , like the truancy-intervention-project , but he resigned his equity-partnership to be able to do so . some cases are challenging because they are so unusual . lawyers at seattle 's perkins coie represented two cold war-era defectors who claim the cia did n't keep promises of financial support . steve hale and betsy alaniz 's clients overcame a cia claim of immunity from judicial-scrutiny , and the case is in discovery . reed smith 's lawyers spent 6,352 hours to recover the archive of pittsburgh photographer teenie harris , who was swindled out of his negatives . cindy kernick , donna doblick and colleen lynch won a jury verdict that awarded harris more than $ 4.2 million in damages , enough to permit the estate to get a judgment and execute on the negatives . an area in which pro-bono-work has surged is among another traditionally-unpopular and vastly under-represented-group : immigrants . `` there 's a greater level of interest in immigration , asylum and international human-rights-work , '' lardent says . latham & watkins was an award-winner chiefly because of its remarkable-involvement in immigration-cases on behalf of unaccompanied-minors . among runners-up is boston solo-eleanor-newhoff . nancy kelly of greater boston legal-services estimates that newhoff spent between 500 and 750 hours on pro-bono in 2001 on 40 cases she took through kelly 's office . and she did other pro-bono-work as well . problems for muslims sept. 11 may reflect a failing of the legal-profession during a crisis for one group , muslim and middle eastern men . sohail mohammed , a clifton , n.j. , solo-practitioner , has been scrambling to get information on the number of them locked up in new jersey after the attacks . he estimates it may be upward of 600 , mostly without lawyers . mohammed-credits the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) with helping to find lawyers to take cases but says he 's frustrated that other groups , including the american immigration-lawyers association ( aila ) have n't acted faster to organize pro-bono representation . jeanne a. butterfield , executive director of aila , says it has n't tried to organize pro-bono lawyers for those detained because of the charges they face . `` the most pressing need for pro-bono are for asylum-applicants , '' she says . `` a student-visa-overstayer is not going to be a high priority for pro-bono assistance . '' while aila has joined the aclu and other organizations in a freedom of information act request to find out who is being detained where and why , mohammed notes that the reasons for the immigrants ' detention were not immediately-clear and sometimes had dire-consequences . `` for the first three or four weeks when we were at the height of these disturbing-trends , people were picked up and missing from their families and one person died in detention , '' he says . `` i would expect the legal-community to be in the forefront of trying to bring this issue to light .
