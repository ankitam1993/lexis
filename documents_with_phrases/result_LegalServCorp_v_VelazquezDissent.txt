supreme court of the united states nos . 99-603 and 99-960 legal-services corporation , petitioner 99-603 v. carmen velazquez et al . united states , petitioner 99-960 v. carmen velazquez et al . on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit [ february 28 , 2001 ] justice scalia , with whom the chief-justice , justice o'connor , and justice thomas join , dissenting . section 504 ( a ) ( 16 ) of the omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations-act of 1996 ( appropriations-act ) defines the scope of a federal-spending-program . it does not directly regulate speech , and it neither establishes a public-forum nor discriminates on the basis of viewpoint . the court agrees with all this , yet applies a novel and unsupportable-interpretation of our public-forum precedents to declare §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) facially-unconstitutional . this holding not only has no foundation in our jurisprudence ; it is flatly contradicted by a recent-decision that is on all fours with the present-case . having found the limitation upon the spending-program unconstitutional , the court then declines to consider the question of severability , allowing a judgment to stand that lets the program go forward under a version of the statute congress never enacted . i respectfully-dissent from both aspects of the judgment . i the legal-services corporation act of 1974 ( lsc act ) , 42 u. s. c. §2996 et seq. , is a federal-subsidy-program , the stated purpose of which is to `` provid [ e ] financial support for legal-assistance in noncriminal-proceedings or matters to persons financially-unable to afford legal-assistance . '' §2996b ( a ) . congress , recognizing that the program could not serve its purpose unless it was `` kept free from the influence of or use by it of political-pressures , '' §2996 ( 5 ) , has from the program 's inception tightly regulated the use of its funds . see ante , at 3 . no legal-services corporation ( lsc ) funds may be used , for example , for `` encouraging . . . labor or antilabor activities , '' §2996f ( b ) ( 6 ) , for `` litigation relating to the desegregation of any elementary or secondary-school or school system , '' §2996f ( b ) ( 9 ) , or for `` litigation which seeks to procure a nontherapeutic-abortion , '' §2996f ( b ) ( 8 ) . congress discovered through experience , however , that these restrictions did not exhaust the politically controversial-uses to which lsc-funds could be put . accordingly , in 1996 congress added new restrictions to the lsc act and strengthened existing-restrictions . among the new restrictions is the one at issue here . section 504 ( a ) ( 16 ) of the appropriations-act , 110 stat . 1321- 55 to 1321-56 , withholds lsc-funds from every entity that `` participates in any . . . way . . . in litigation , lobbying , or rulemaking . . . involving an effort to reform a federal or state welfare-system . '' it thus bans lsc-funded-entities from participating on either side of litigation involving such statutes , from participating in rulemaking relating to the implementation of such legislation , and from lobbying congress itself regarding any proposed-changes to such legislation . see 45 cfr §1639.3 ( 2000 ) . the restrictions relating to rulemaking and lobbying are superfluous ; they duplicate general-prohibitions on the use of lsc-funds for those activities found elsewhere in the appropriations-act . see §§504 ( a ) ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) . the restriction on litigation , however , is unique , and it contains a proviso specifying what the restriction does not cover . funding-recipients may `` represen [ t ] an individual eligible-client who is seeking specific-relief from a welfare-agency if such relief does not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing-law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation . '' the lsc declares in its brief , and respondents do not deny , that under these provisions the lsc can sponsor neither challenges to nor defenses of existing welfare-reform law , brief for petitioner in no . 99-603 , p. 29 . the litigation-ban is symmetrical : litigants challenging the covered statutes or regulations do not receive lsc-funding , and neither do litigants defending those laws against challenge . if a suit for benefits raises a claim outside the scope of the lsc program , the lsc-funded-lawyer may not participate in the suit . as the court explains , if lsc-funded-lawyers anticipate that a forbidden-claim will arise in a prospective-client 's suit , they '' may not undertake [ the ] representation , '' ante , at 9 . likewise , if a forbidden-claim arises unexpectedly at trial , `` lsc-funded-attorney [ s ] must cease the representation at once , '' ante , at 10 . see also brief for petitioner in no . 99-603 , at 7 , n. 4 ( if the issue arises at trial , `` the lawyer should discontinue the representation 'consistent with the applicable-rules of professional-responsibility ' '' ) . the lawyers may , however , and indeed must explain to the client why they can not represent him . see 164 f. 3d 757 , 765 ( ca2 1999 ) . they are also free to express their views of the legality of the welfare-law to the client , and they may refer the client to another attorney who can accept the representation , ibid . see 985 f. supp 323 , 335-336 ( edny 1997 ) . ii the lsc act is a federal-subsidy-program , not a federal regulatory-program , and `` [ t ] here is a basic-difference between [ the two ] . '' maher v. roe , 432 u. s. 464 , 475 ( 1977 ) . regulations directly restrict speech ; subsidies do not . subsidies , it is true , may indirectly abridge-speech , but only if the funding-scheme is '' 'manipulated ' to have a 'coercive effect ' '' on those who do not hold the subsidized-position . national endowment for arts v. finley , 524 u. s. 569 , 587 ( 1998 ) ( quoting arkansas writers' project , inc. v. ragland , 481 u. s. 221 , 237 ( 1987 ) ( scalia , j. , dissenting ) ) . proving unconstitutional-coercion is difficult enough when the spending-program has universal-coverage and excludes only certain speech- such as a tax-exemption-scheme excluding-lobbying expenses . the court has found such programs unconstitutional only when the exclusion was `` aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas . '' speiser v. randall , 357 u. s. 513 , 519 ( 1958 ) ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) ; see also regan v. taxation with representation of wash. , 461 u. s. 540 , 550 ( 1983 ) . proving the requisite-coercion is harder still when a spending-program is not universal but limited , providing-benefits to a restricted-number of recipients , see rust v. sullivan , 500 u. s. 173 , 194-195 ( 1991 ) . the court has found such selective-spending unconstitutionally coercive only once , when the government created a public-forum with the spending-program but then discriminated in distributing-funding within the forum on the basis of viewpoint . see rosenberger v. rector and visitors of univ . of va. , 515 u. s. 819 , 829-830 ( 1995 ) . when the limited-spending-program does not create a public-forum , proving-coercion is virtually-impossible , because simply denying a subsidy `` does not 'coerce ' belief , '' lyng v. automobile workers , 485 u. s. 360 , 369 ( 1988 ) , and because the criterion of unconstitutionality is whether denial of the subsidy threatens `` to drive certain-ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace , '' national endowment for arts v. finley , supra , at 587 ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) . absent such a threat , `` the government may allocate . . . funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct-regulation of speech or a criminal-penalty at stake . '' 524 u. s. , at 587-588 . in rust v. sullivan , supra , the court applied these principles to a statutory-scheme that is in all relevant-respects indistinguishable from §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) . the statute in rust authorized grants for the provision of family-planning-services , but provided that `` [ n ] one of the funds . . . shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family-planning . '' id. , at 178 . valid regulations implementing the statute required-funding-recipients to refer pregnant-clients `` for appropriate prenatal . . . services by furnishing a list of available-providers that promote the welfare of mother and unborn-child , '' but forbade them to refer a pregnant woman specifically to an abortion-provider , even upon request . id. , at 180 . we rejected a first amendment free-speech-challenge to the funding-scheme , explaining that `` [ t ] he government can , without violating the constitution , selectively fund a program to encourage certain-activities it believes to be in the public-interest , without at the same time funding an alternative-program which seeks to deal with the problem another way . '' id. , at 193 . this was not , we said , the type of `` discriminat [ ion ] on the basis of viewpoint '' that triggers strict-scrutiny , ibid. , because the `` 'decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental-right does not infringe the right , ' '' ibid . ( quoting regan v. taxation with representation of wash. , supra , at 549 ) . the same is true here . the lsc act , like the scheme in rust , see 500 u. s. , at 200 , does not create a public-forum . far from encouraging a diversity of views , it has always , as the court accurately-states , `` placed restrictions on its use of funds , '' ante , at 3 . nor does §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) discriminate on the basis of viewpoint , since it funds neither challenges to nor defenses of existing-welfare-law . the provision simply declines to subsidize a certain class of litigation , and under rust that decision `` does not infringe the right '' to bring such litigation . cf . ortwein v. schwab , 410 u. s. 656 , 658-660 , and n. 5 ( 1973 ) ( per curiam ) ( government not required by first amendment or due-process-clause to waive filing-fee for welfare-benefits-litigation ) . the court's repeated claims that §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) `` restricts '' and `` prohibits '' speech , see , e.g. , ante , at 10 , 11 , and `` insulates '' laws from judicial-review , see , e.g. , ante , at 13 , are simply-baseless . no litigant who , in the absence of lsc-funding , would bring a suit challenging existing-welfare-law is deterred from doing so by §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) . rust thus controls these cases and compels the conclusion that §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) is constitutional . the court contends that rust is different because the program at issue subsidized-government-speech , while the lsc-funds private-speech . see ante , at 7-8 . this is so unpersuasive it hardly needs response . if the private-doctors ' confidential-advice to their patients at issue in rust constituted `` government-speech , '' it is hard to imagine what subsidized-speech would not be government-speech . moreover , the majority 's contention that the subsidized-speech in these cases is not government-speech because the lawyers have a professional-obligation to represent the interests of their clients-founders on the reality that the doctors in rust had a professional-obligation to serve the interests of their patients , see 500 u. s. , at 214 ( blackmun , j. , dissenting ) ( `` ethical-responsibilities of the medical-profession '' ) - which at the time of rust we had held to be highly-relevant to the permissible-scope of federal-regulation , see thornburgh v. american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , 476 u. s. 747 , 763 ( 1986 ) ( `` professional-responsibilities '' of physicians ) , overruled in part on other grounds , planned parenthood of southeastern pa. v. casey , 505 u. s. 833 ( 1992 ) . even respondents agree that `` the true-speaker in rust was not the government , but a doctor . '' brief for respondents 19 , n. 17 . scalia , j. , dissenting the court further asserts that these cases are different from rust because the welfare-funding-restriction `` seeks to use an existing-medium of expression and to control it . . . in ways which distort its usual-functioning , '' ante , at 8 . this is wrong on both the facts and the law . it is wrong on the law because there is utterly no precedent for the novel and facially-implausible proposition that the first amendment has anything to do with government-funding that- though it does not actually-abridge anyone 's speech- `` distorts an existing-medium of expression . '' none of the three cases cited by the court mentions such an odd principle . in rosenberger v. rector and visitors of univ . of va. , the point critical to the court 's analysis was not , as the court would have it , that it is part of the `` usual-functioning '' of student-newspapers to `` expres [ s ] many different-points of view , '' ante , at 9 ( it surely is not ) , but rather that the spending-program itself had been created `` to encourage a diversity of views from private-speakers , '' 515 u. s. , at 834 . what could not be distorted was the public-forum that the spending-program had created . as for arkansas ed . television comm'n v. forbes , 523 u. s. 666 ( 1998 ) , that case discussed the nature of television-broadcasting , not to determine whether government-regulation would alter its `` usual-functioning '' and thus violate the first amendment ( no government-regulation was even at issue in the case ) , but rather to determine whether state-owned-television is a `` public-forum '' under our first amendment jurisprudence . id. , at 673-674 . and finally , the passage the court cites from fcc v. league of women voters of cal. , 468 u. s. 364 , 396-397 ( 1984 ) , says nothing whatever about `` using the forum [ of public-radio ] in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium , '' ante , at 8-9 . it discusses why the government 's asserted-interest in `` preventing [ public-radio ] stations from becoming a privileged-outlet for the political and ideological-opinions of station-owners and managers , '' 468 u. s. , at 396 ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) , was insubstantial and thus could not justify the statute 's restriction on editorializing . even worse for the court , after invalidating the restriction on this conventional first amendment ground , league of women voters goes on to say that `` [ o ] f course , '' the restriction on editorializing `` would plainly be valid '' if `` congress were to adopt a revised version of [ the statute ] that permitted [ public-radio ] stations to establish 'affiliate ' organizations which could then use the station 's facilities to editorialize with nonfederal-funds . '' id. , at 400 . but of course that is the case here . regulations permit funding-recipients to establish affiliate organizations to conduct litigation and other activities that fall outside the scope of the lsc program . see 45 cfr pt . 1610 ( 2000 ) . far from supporting the court 's nondistortion-analysis , league of women voters dooms the court 's case . the court 's `` nondistortion '' principle is also wrong on the facts , since there is no basis for believing that §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) , by causing `` cases [ to ] be presented by lsc-attorneys who [ can ] not advise the courts of serious-questions of statutory-validity , '' ante , at 11 , will distort the operation of the courts . it may well be that the bar of §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) will cause lsc-funded-attorneys to decline or to withdraw from cases that involve statutory-validity . but that means at most that fewer statutory-challenges to welfare-laws will be presented to the courts because of the unavailability of free legal-services for that purpose . so what ? the same result would ensue from excluding lscfunded-lawyers from welfare-litigation entirely . it is not the mandated , nondistortable function of the courts to inquire into all `` serious-questions of statutory-validity '' in all cases . courts must consider only those questions of statutory-validity that are presented by litigants , and if the government chooses not to subsidize the presentation of some such questions , that in no way `` distorts '' the courts ' role . it is remarkable that a court that has so studiously avoided deciding whether congress could entirely eliminate federal-jurisdiction over certain-matters , see , e.g. , webster v. doe , 486 u. s. 592 , 603 ( 1988 ) ; bowen v. michigan academy of family physicians , 476 u. s. 667 , 681 , n. 12 ( 1986 ) , would be so eager to hold the much lesser step of declining to subsidize the litigation unconstitutional under the first amendment . nor will the judicial-opinions produced by lsc-cases systematically distort the interpretation of welfare-laws . judicial decisions do not stand as binding `` precedent '' for points that were not raised , not argued , and hence not analyzed . see , e.g. , united states v. verdugo-urquidez , 494 u. s. 259 , 272 ( 1990 ) ; hagans v. lavine , 415 u. s. 528 , 533 , n. 5 ( 1974 ) ; united states v. l. a. tucker truck lines , inc. , 344 u. s. 33 , 37-38 ( 1952 ) ; united states v. more , 3 cranch 159 , 172 ( 1805 ) ( marshall , c . j. ) . the statutory-validity that courts assume in lsc-cases will remain open for full-determination in later-cases . finally , the court is troubled `` because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation , the client is unlikely to find other counsel . '' ante , at 12 . that is surely-irrelevant , since it leaves the welfare-recipient in no worse condition than he would have been in had the lsc program never been enacted . respondents properly concede that even if welfare-claimants can not obtain a lawyer anywhere else , the government is not required to provide one . brief for respondents 16 ; accord , goldberg v. kelly , 397 u. s. 254 , 270 ( 1970 ) ( government not required to provide counsel at hearing regarding-termination of welfare-benefits ) . it is hard to see how providing free legal-services to some welfare-claimants ( those whose claims do not challenge the applicable-statutes ) while not providing it to others is beyond the range of legitimate legislative-choice . rust rejected a similar-argument : '' petitioners contend , however , that most title x cli scalia , j. , dissenting ents are effectively precluded by indigency and poverty from seeing a health-care-provider who will provide abortion-related services . but once again , even these title x clients are in no worse position than if congress had never enacted title x . the financial-constraints that restrict an indigent-woman 's ability to enjoy the full-range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental-restrictions on access to abortion , but rather of her indigency . '' 500 u. s. , at 203 ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) . the only conceivable-argument that can be made for distinguishing rust is that there even patients who wished to receive abortion-counseling could receive the nonabortion-services that the government-funded-clinic offered , whereas here some potential lsc-clients who wish to receive representation on a benefits claim that does not challenge the statutes will be unable to do so because their cases raise a reform-claim that an lsc lawyer may not present . this difference , of course , is required by the same ethical-canons that the court elsewhere does not wish to distort . rather than sponsor `` truncated-representation , '' ante , at 11 , congress chose to subsidize only those cases in which the attorneys it subsidized could work freely . see , e.g. , 42 u. s. c. §2996 ( 6 ) ( `` [ a ] ttorneys providing legal-assistance must have full-freedom to protect the best interests of their clients '' ) . and it is impossible to see how this difference from rust has any bearing upon the first amendment question , which , to repeat , is whether the funding-scheme is `` 'manipulated ' to have a 'coercive effect ' '' on those who do not hold the subsidized-position . national endowment for arts v. finley , 524 u. s. , at 587 ( quoting arkansas writers' project , inc. v. ragland , 481 u. s. , at 237 ( scalia , j. , dissenting ) ) . it could be claimed to have such an effect if the client in a case-ineligible for lsc representation could eliminate the ineligibility by waiving the claim that the statute is invalid ; but he can not . no conceivable coercive-effect exists . this has been a very long discussion to make a point that is embarrassingly-simple : the lsc subsidy neither prevents anyone from speaking nor coerces-anyone to change speech , and is indistinguishable in all relevant-respects from the subsidy upheld in rust v. sullivan , supra . there is no legitimate-basis for declaring §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) facially-unconstitutional . iii even were i to accept the court 's first amendment analysis , i could not join its decision to conclude this litigation without reaching the issue of severability . that issue , although decided by the second circuit , was not included within the question on which certiorari was granted , and , as the court points out , was not briefed or argued here . i nonetheless think it an abuse of discretion to ignore it . the court has said that `` [ w ] e may consider questions outside the scope of the limited-order [ granting certiorari ] when resolution of those questions is necessary for the proper-disposition of the case . '' piper aircraft co. v. reyno , 454 u. s. 235 , 246-247 , n. 12 ( 1981 ) . i think it necessary to a `` proper-disposition '' here because the statute concocted by the court of appeals bears little resemblance to what congress enacted , funding without restriction welfare-benefits-litigation that congress funded only under the limitations of §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) . although no party briefed-severability in denver area ed . telecommunications consortium , inc. v. fcc , 518 u. s. 727 ( 1996 ) , the justices finding partial-unconstitutionality considered it necessary to address the issue . id. , at 767 ( plurality opinion ) ( `` [ w ] e must ask whether §10 ( a ) is severable '' ) ; accord , new york v. united states , 505 u. s. 144 , 186 ( 1992 ) . i think we have that same obligation here . moreover , by exercising our `` discretion '' to leave the severability-question open , we fail to resolve the basic , realworld-dispute at issue : whether lsc-attorneys may represent welfare-claimants who challenge the applicable-welfare-laws . indeed , we leave the lsc program-subject to even a greater uncertainty than the one we purport to have eliminated , since other circuits may conclude ( as i do ) that if the limitation upon welfare-representation is unconstitutional , lsc-attorneys can not engage in welfare-litigation at all . `` the inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into legislative-intent . '' minnesota v. mille lacs band of chippewa indians , 526 u. s. 172 , 191 ( 1999 ) . if congress `` would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power , independently of that which is not , '' then courts must strike the provisions as a piece . alaska airlines , inc. v. brock , 480 u. s. 678 , 684 ( 1987 ) ( internal-quotation-marks omitted ) . one determines what congress would have done by examining what it did . perhaps the most that can be said on the subject is contained in a passage written by chief-justice shaw of the supreme judicial court of massachusetts that we have often quoted : '' [ i ] f [ a statute 's provisions ] are so mutually connected with and dependent on each other , as conditions , considerations or compensations for each other , as to warrant a belief that the legislature intended them as a whole , and that , if all could not be carried into effect , the legislature would not pass the residue independently , and some parts are unconstitutional , all the provisions which as thus-dependent , conditional or connected , must fall with them . '' warren v. mayor and aldermen of charlestown , 68 mass . 84 , 99 ( 1854 ) . it is clear to me that the lsc act 's funding of welfare-benefits-suits and its prohibition on suits challenging or defending the validity of existing-law are `` conditions , considerations [ and ] compensations for each other '' that can not be severed . congress through the lsc act intended `` to provide high quality legal-assistance to those who would be otherwise-unable to afford adequate legal-counsel , '' 42 u. s. c. §2996 ( 2 ) , but only if the program could at the same time `` be kept free from the influence of or use by it of political-pressures , '' §2996 ( 5 ) . more than a dozen times in §504 ( a ) congress made the decision that certain-activities could not be funded at all without crippling the lsc program with political-pressures . see , e.g. , §504 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( reapportionment litigation ) ; §504 ( a ) ( 4 ) ( local , state , and federal lobbying ) ; §504 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( class-action-lawsuits ) ; §504 ( a ) ( 12 ) ( training-programs for , inter-alia , boycotts , picketing , and demonstrations ) ; §504 ( a ) ( 14 ) ( litigation with respect to abortion ) . the severability-question here is , essentially , whether , without the restriction that the court today-invalidates , the permission for conducting welfare-litigation would have been accorded . as far as appears from the best evidence ( which is the structure of the statute ) , i think the answer must be no . we have in some cases stated that when an `` excepting-proviso is found unconstitutional the substantive-provisions which it qualifies can not stand , '' for `` to hold otherwise would be to extend the scope of the law . . . so as to embrace [ situations ] which the legislature passing the statute had , by its very terms , expressly excluded . '' frost v. corporation comm'n of okla. , 278 u. s. 515 , 525 ( 1929 ) ; see also davis v. wallace , 257 u. s. 478 , 484 ( 1922 ) ( `` where an excepting-provision in a statute is found unconstitutional , courts very generally hold that this does not work an enlargement of the scope or operation of other provisions with which that provision was enacted , and which it was intended to qualify or restrain '' ) . i frankly doubt whether this approach has been followed consistently enough to be called the `` general '' rule , but if there were ever an instance in which it is appropriate it is here . to strike the restriction on welfare-benefits-suits is to void §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) altogether . subsection ( a ) ( 16 ) prohibits involvement in three types of activities with respect to welfare-reform : lobbying , rulemaking , and litigation . but the proscriptions against using lsc-funds to participate in welfare-lobbying and rulemaking are superfluous , since as described above subsections ( a ) ( 2 ) , ( a ) ( 3 ) , and ( a ) ( 4 ) of §504 withhold lsc-funds from those activities generally . what is unique about subsection ( a ) ( 16 ) - the only thing it achieves- is its limit on litigation . to remove that limit is to repeal subsection ( a ) ( 16 ) altogether , and thus to eliminate a significant-quid pro quo of the legislative-compromise . we have no authority to `` rewrite [ the ] statute and give it an effect altogether-different '' from what congress agreed to . railroad-retirement bd . v. alton r. co. , 295 u. s. 330 , 362 ( 1935 ) ( quoted in carter v. carter coal co. , 298 u. s. 238 , 313 ( 1936 ) ) . *** it is illuminating to speculate how these cases would have been decided if congress had enacted §504 ( a ) ( 16 ) without its proviso ( prescribing only the general-ban against `` litigation , lobbying , or rulemaking , involving an effort to reform a federal or state welfare-system '' ) , and if the positions of the parties before us here were reversed . if the lsc-funded-lawyers were here arguing that the statute permitted representation of individual-welfare claimants who did not challenge existing-law , i venture to say that the court would endorse their argument- perhaps with stirring language about the importance of aid to welfare-applicants and the court 's unwillingness to presume without clear-indication that congress would want to eliminate it . and i have little-doubt that in that context scalia , j. , dissenting the court would find its current first amendment musings as unpersuasive as i find them today . today 's decision is quite simply-inexplicable on the basis of our prior-law . the only difference between rust and the present-case is that the former involved `` distortion '' of ( that is to say , refusal to subsidize ) the normal-work of doctors , and the latter involves `` distortion '' of ( that is to say , refusal to subsidize ) the normal-work of lawyers . the court 's decision displays not only an improper special-solicitude for our own profession ; it also displays , i think , the very fondness for `` reform through the courts '' - the making of innumerable social-judgments through judgepronounced constitutional imperatives- that prompted congress to restrict publicly funded litigation of this sort . the court says today , through an unprecedented ( and indeed previously rejected ) interpretation of the first amendment , that we will not allow this restriction- and then , to add insult to injury , permits to stand a judgment that awards the general-litigation-funding that the statute does not contain . i respectfully-dissent .
