legal-services corporation serving the civil legal-needs of low-income americans a special report to congressï¿½april 30 , 2000 i . summary legal-services corporation ( lsc ) is a private , non-membership , nonprofit-corporation in the district of columbia . the board of directors of lsc is composed of eleven-voting-members who are appointed by the president of the united states with the advice and consent of the senate . by law , the board is bipartisan : no more than six members can be of the same political-party . lsc plays a central-role in providing low-income americans with access to legal-assistance and information concerning critical civil legal-problems . created in 1974 , lsc is charged by congress '' to provide equal-access to the system of justice in our nation for individuals who seek redress of grievances '' and `` to provide high quality legal-assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to afford adequate legal-counsel . '' for 1999 , lsc grantees reported closing 1,038,662 million1 civil legal-cases relating to issues such as domestic-violence , child-custody and visitation-rights , evictions , access to health care , bankruptcy , unemployment and disability-claims , and many other issues that millions of low-income americans face throughout their lives . without the funding provided by lsc , many of these individuals would have no other source of legal-assistance for these problems . ii . the national legal-services-program legal-services corporation funds local legal-services-programs to serve clients in every state , county , and congressional-district in the united states as well as in puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam and micronesia . in addition , special-service-areas are funded for two populations with special-needs - native americans and migrant-workers . eligibility for services is determined on a case-by-case-basis-pursuant to grantee eligibility-criteria established under parameters set forth in lsc regulations . each grantee establishes a maximum income eligibility level , not to exceed 125 percent of the current official federal-poverty-income guidelines . in 1996 , congress implemented a number of new accountability-requirements including competitive-bidding for legal-services corporation grants . this system of competitive-bidding eliminated the right of grantees to a hearing to contest a funding-decision awarding a grant to a competitor , ensuring lsc can award grants to the best applicants without unnecessary administrative-barriers . additionally , new compliance-monitoring-procedures , which use outside-auditors to monitor grantee-compliance with regulations and to perform comprehensive yearly-oversight of grantee-activities , were formulated . another new provision adopted in 1997 prohibits any local-program that has been found to engage in a substantial violation of the law or its grant-conditions from being considered for an lsc-grant in future-competitions . also in 1996 , other new requirements were adopted governing what legal-services-programs can do and whom they can represent . these new guidelines have refocused the lsc delivery-system on serving individual-clients with particular legal-needs . with the 1 for a complete-explanation of the number of cases closed for 1999 , see section v , 1999 case-statistics . implementation of these restrictions , legal-services-attorneys are not permitted to initiate or participate in class-action-lawsuits . they may not challenge or engage in any activity to influence-welfare-reform . they may not collect court-awarded attorneys ' fees . litigation on behalf of prisoners and representation of undocumented and other categories of aliens is also prohibited . other new requirements address redistricting , cases involving-eviction from public-housing of individuals charged with or convicted of drug-violations and participation in government-rulemaking and solicitation . unlike past-laws restricting the work of legal-services , these provisions apply to all the funds of a recipient , with very few specified exceptions . all local lsc-funded-programs are administered by local-boards of directors ( or other governing-bodies , in certain-instances ) , a majority of whose members are appointed by local-bar-associations , and provide legal-assistance to individuals pursuant to locally determined priorities that respond to community-conditions and needs . based on these priorities , local-programs hire staff , contact local-attorneys , and develop pro-bono programs for the direct-delivery of legal-assistance to eligible-clients . lsc requires each legal-services-program to spend an amount equal to at least 12.5 percent of its annualized-grant to encourage participation by private-attorneys in the provision of legal-assistance to poor-individuals . the legal-services-delivery system offers a model of efficient resolution of disputes and avoidance of unnecessary-litigation . only a very small-percentage ( 9 % in 1999 ) of lsc-funded-cases are resolved by the decision of a court , and the majority of these are family-law-cases that require a court-determination . rather than litigating-cases , legal-services-lawyers consistently find other , more efficient-ways to solve problems for their clients . under tremendous-pressure from the demand for their services , they know they must use their limited-resources wisely . as in past-years , nearly threefourths of cases in 1999 were resolved through advice , referral , or brief-services . 2 % 20 % iii . the case-statistics issue lsc acknowledges that serious-questions have been raised concerning the accuracy and validity of the case service report ( csr ) data submitted annually by our grantees.2 lsc is aware that problems exist in the statistical-reports received and is taking-steps to identify and correct those problems . the problems identified stem , in part , from a lack of clarity in some of lsc's past-case reporting-guidelines and , more generally , from insufficient-attention by grantees to the existing-reporting and documentation-requirements . it should be kept in mind that the issue is largely one of grantee-compliance with technical and administrative-guidance on how and when to report certain-activities . in no instance has lsc , its inspector-general , or the general-accounting-office identified any fraud or intentional-misrepresentation by any of the grantees in their compilation and reporting of this data . lsc will aggressively take steps to correct-problems associated with the csr system , and will continue to make full and timely-reports to the u.s. congress and the public . lsc-views the issues concerning the csr-data to be akin to those encountered by many government-entities as they attempt to meet the goals envisioned by the government-performance and results act ( gpra ) . self-initiated review of csr-data lsc 's review of its csr-data was an outgrowth of its ongoing oversight-responsibilities and it has become integral to its voluntary strategic-planning-process . although not subject to the government-performance and results act , lsc shares the aspirations of that law to rationalize the budget and appropriations-processes by tying-funding into objective-measures of the agency's performance . in november 1997 , the lsc board adopted its first strategic-plan for fy 1998-2003 . the strategic-directions adopted by the board will achieve lsc 's vision3 by accomplishing two major strategic-goals : ( 1 ) by 2004 , lsc will dramatically increase the provision of legal-services to eligible-persons ; ( 2 ) by 2004 , lsc will ensure that eligible-clients are receiving appropriate and high quality legal-assistance . that plan is currently being revised - as are the 2 `` the conferees have concerns about the case-service-reporting and associated-data-reports submitted annually by the corporation's grantees and the case statistical-reports submitted by the corporation to the congress , and the conferees direct the corporation to make improvement of the accuracy of these submissions a top priority , per directions in the house report . the conferees also direct the corporation to submit its 1999 annual case-service-reports and associated-data-reports to congress no later than april 30 , 2000 . '' departments of commerce , justice , and state , the judiciary , and related agencies appropriations-act of 2000 , pub . l. no . 106-113 , 112 stat . 1501 . 3 twenty-five-years ago , our government made a pledge to help ensure that all persons have access to america 's civil-justice-system by enacting-legislation that created legal-services corporation . over the past-quarter-century , lsc has helped millions of low-income-citizens solve important , sometimes-life-threatening , legal-problems . despite the success of lsc and its many contributions to access to justice for low-income americans , its achievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in our society continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain access to a lawyer for critical legal-assistance . until all members of our society are afforded that access , this promise of our government will continue to be unfulfilled . lsc is committed to promoting a new vision of legal-services that will achieve the goal of bringing legal-services to those currently denied-access to the justice-system . initial-plans submitted by many governmental-entities . as recently reported by gao , most federal-agencies are far from meeting the goals set by gpra for performance-data on which the administration and congress can rely on in setting-budget-amounts and appropriations-levels . nonetheless , lsc , having embarked on the path laid out by gpra , recognizes the need to assess the data currently-available on grantee-activity for its accuracy and adequacy as a measure of lsc 's performance . when the first strategic-plan was published , and adopted clients served as a performance-measure , the lsc inspector-general decided there was a need to determine the accuracy of the grantees ' reports on which the measure was based . a series of audits of 1997 data was conducted in 1998 in anticipation of the first performance-report due in 2000 . these audits examined the accuracy of case statistical-reports submitted by six grantees , and the causes of identified deficiencies , rather than validating or testing the accuracy of national or system-wide-data . initial-findings what lsc found when it began the assessment of the csr system was a 20-year-old reporting-structure , the guidance for which had not been updated since 1993 . the reporting-system rested on the definition of a `` case . '' however clear and meaningful the definition of a case may have been in the past , it became evident the definition had not kept pace with the changes in the service-delivery systems . as the pace of the evolution of service-delivery systems and the reconfiguration of grantees accelerated following the funding-cutbacks and program-reforms in 1996 , and spurred on by the technological-revolution , the reporting of grantee-activity solely on the basis of `` cases '' was becoming increasingly inadequate . this resulted in inconsistent and inaccurate-reporting . critical legal-services were now being provided , inter-alia , through internet-web-sites , through toll-free-telephone-intake and brief-advice-systems , through pro se clinics and projects , and through stand-alone-kiosks . an attorney representing a client before judge and jury was no longer the norm of a `` case '' when delivering critical legal-services to low-income-individuals . the audits conducted by the general-accounting-office ( gao ) and reported in june 1999 , confirmed the inspector-general 's findings as to the factors causing systemic-errors in grantee-case reporting . 4 the gao visited five large-programs : puerto rico legal-services , inc. , legal-services for new york city , legal-aid foundation of los angeles , legal-assistance foundation of chicago , and legal-aid bureau , inc. in baltimore , maryland . overall , the gao deemed questionable approximately 34 percent of both open and closed-cases reported by the five grantees in 1997 . the percentage of questionable-cases for individual-programs ranged from 7 percent to 42 percent . a problem common to all programs was the untimely closure of cases , although again the extent of the problem in any particular-program varied from under 4 percent in one program to over 30 percent in another . overall , the gao questioned between 5-9 percent of the cases reported because of the lack of adequate financial-eligibility-documentation and between 7-24 percent of the cases for lack of citizenship or alien-status-documentation . it should 4 gao/ggd-99-135r lsc case reporting problems . be noted that gao concluded only that the case-files failed to contain the documentation necessary to confirm the eligibility or ineligibility of any of these clients . lsc 's corrective-action as these concerns surfaced , lsc decided as an initial-step to reissue the 1993 csr-handbook in may 1998 , providing additional-guidance on particular-areas that were considered to be most prone to error . in general , clearer guidance was provided to programs on reviewing their own reporting-procedures and practices , ensuring they conformed to the handbook and ensuring all branch-offices were aware of and were following these procedures . lsc reiterated guidance on not reporting financially or otherwise-ineligible clients , referrals of ineligible-cases or cases for which no legal-work was performed . recognizing this guidance would not affect the 1997 csr-data , which had already been submitted by the grantees , but wanting to improve the accuracy of future csr-data , lsc sought to heighten the awareness of grantees to the csr requirements and to focus their attention on potential-problem-areas . as previously reported to congress , though , a number of grantees did voluntarily submit corrections to their 1997 csr-data during 1998 . as the audit-information became available during 1998 and into 1999 , lsc gained a fuller understanding of the extent of the csr problem and its complexities . even though quantifiable-data was lacking during most of 1998 , lsc had sufficient-information to begin taking-actions to address the problems . as previously noted , lsc reissued its csr instructions to all grantees , calling attention to problem-areas known at that time . recognizing that more action was needed to improve the csr system , lsc provided additional written-guidance to the field , including a substantial revision to its csr-handbook ( reissued in november 1998 ) , and conducted training-sessions on that guidance . in addition , lsc has required all grantees to perform a self-inspection of their csr-data , has followed up on grantees where corrective-action was found necessary , and has increased its on-site-presence to test grantee-compliance . 5 iv . what is a case ? a case is defined as the provision of permissible legal-assistance to an eligible-client with a legal-problem , or set of closely related legal-problems , accepted for assistance supported by lsc or non-lsc-funds in accordance with the requirements of the lsc act , regulations , and other applicable-law . 6 5 the fy2001-budget-request includes $ 1.54 million in additional-funds to provide 40 annual specialized on-site-compliance-reviews . these on-site-reviews will allow lsc management to identify program weaknesses , engage in effective corrective-actions plans oversight , and provide program-specific needed guidance and oversight . the reviews will allow lsc to more effectively execute its compliance function and ensure the accuracy of csr reporting by its grantees . 6 legal-services-programs may record and report the provision of legal-assistance as a case only if : ( a ) the client is financially and otherwise-eligible to receive assistance under the lsc act , regulations , and other applicable-law ; the client 's case is within program-priorities ( or is an emergency-case accepted under the program 's emergency-case acceptance procedures ) ; the legal-services-program has actually accepted the client for service through its intake-system or another established-procedure for ensuring-client eligibility ; ( b ) the type of legal-assistance provided to the client is not prohibited by the lsc act , regulations , or other applicable-law ( e.g . a class-action ) ; ( c ) the legal since 1997 , lsc has significantly tightened its requirements for what constitutes a case . a case that is eligible to be counted as such must include some actual-counsel and advice or other legal-assistance provided to the client . thus , analysis and referral of a case to another legal-services-provider can not be counted , nor can service where the client is accepted and work is done , but the client-withdraws or loses contact with the program before any actual legal-assistance is provided . programs have been required to screen their submissions for '' duplicates . '' a duplicate is not merely the submission of exactly the same case twice by computer or other error , but also any situation in which the same client-returns to the program with the same legal-problem in the same year . the test as to how similar the issue in two separate-requests for assistance has to be before it is counted as one case has presented significant-borderline problems , but there have been a large number of clear-duplicates eliminated from the case-reports . it has also been clarified that if a case fails to meet any required-documentation ( financial-eligibility , citizenship/eligible alien-status , within program-priorities , etc . ) it may not be reported to lsc as a case . especially for 1999 , lsc has substantially strengthened the documentation-requirements for reporting a case to lsc . as a result , numerous-cases have been excluded from reporting , even though the client received legal-service , because the case was not documented according to lsc requirements . for many of these cases , it was overwhelmingly-likely that the client and the service would have been eligible to be counted as a closed-case but for the lack of proper documentation . programs , however , are allowed to count closed-cases for the elderly and for battered-women under the following specific programs without financial-eligibility-information because these federal-programs require that clients be accepted regardless of financial-circumstances : title xx social-security act , titles iii and iv older americans act , and violence against women act . v. 1999 case-statistics for 1999 , lsc grantees reported closing 1,038,662 civil legal-cases relating to issues such as domestic-violence7 , child-custody and visitation-rights , evictions , access to health care , bankruptcy , unemployment and disability-claims , and many other issues faced by millions of low-income americans . the consequences of such problems may be as serious as the loss of a family 's only source of income or homelessness . left-unresolved , they can cost society far more than the expense of providing legal-services to address them . other case-types frequently encountered include foreclosures , collections and repossessions , child-support , and wage-claims . without the federal-funding provided by lsc to local legal-services-programs , many , and problem ( s ) of a client are not of a type prohibited by the lsc act , regulations , or other applicable-law ( e.g. , an abortion case ) . 7 in 1999 , it is estimated that lsc grantees received approximately $ 10.5 million in federal-funds under the violence against women act ( vawa ) for use in rendering-assistance in domestic-violence-cases . it is estimated that in the year 2000 they will receive approximately $ 11.5 million in vawa-funding . 6 consumer 1 % possibly most , of these individuals with these problems would have no other source of legal-assistance . despite lsc 's significant-efforts to improve the data-accuracy , there may be occurrences of errors in documentation or substance in this number . in january of this year , lsc instructed all programs to conduct a self-inspection of a sample of closed-cases prior to submitting 1999 csr-data to lsc . the purpose of the self-inspection-process was to provide programs a means to verify , by reviewing a sample of cases , that their 1999 csr-data satisfies lsc 's standards for accuracy . in addition , it provides lsc management useful insight into the current-nature and extent of the csr-data issue . although the self-inspection was not constructed , or executed , to yield a statistically-valid assessment of the accuracy of the closed-cases for 1999 , the self-inspection did reveal , lsc believes , significant-improvements in data-accuracy from previous years . again stressing this process did not produce an extensive assessment , lsc management submits that it is sufficient to reasonably estimate the population of reported cases contains an error-rate of 11 percent . in order to fulfill our pledge to the u.s. congress and to the general-public concerning our commitment to providing the most accurate and reliable-data , we adjusted the number of cases reported by lsc grantees ( 1,038,662 ) by the average estimated-error rate ( 11 % ) . accordingly , we submit a total of cases closed for 1999 of 924,000 . for reasons that will be discussed in subsequent-sections of this report , we also highlight that this figure represents only a portion of the work conducted by lsc grantees . nonetheless , it represents the most reliable , albeit conservative 8 , estimate of cases closed in 1999 by lsc grantees . 8 the adjusted total of 924,000 is conservative because : ( a ) some grantees did use self-inspection-data to exclude leveraging federal-resources federal-funding to legal-services corporation provides the national-infrastructure for the u.s. civil legal-services-delivery system . but for the federal-investment , the overwhelming-majority of cases reported by lsc grantees would not have been possible . in six states , the federal-investment represents almost the entire-contribution for providing civil legal-services to low-income individuals.9 in another sixteen states , lsc-funding represents over 50 % of the total-investment in the civil legal-services system.10 beginning with 1999 cases , another significant-change is the requirement for programs to report all cases eligible for lsc services , regardless of the funding-source . the prior-rule mandated that each case had to be at least partially funded by lsc-funds , as well as being lsceligible . this new change is intended to make case reporting more consistent among grantee-programs as these programs have varying-mixes of lsc and non-lsc-funding and varying , legitimate-methods of allocating lsc and non-lsc-funding among their activities that produce case-closures . as noted above , the lsc case-count for 1999 includes all cases that meet lsc eligibility-criteria , regardless of the funding-mix of any particular-grantee . lsc strongly encourages all its grantees to obtain other funding for the client-community that congress has legislated is eligible for lsc-funding . the ability to leverage other funds to represent lsc eligible-clients is a factor lsc considers in evaluating its grantees . lsc believes that the total number of lsc eligible-clients served by lsc grantees is of considerable-relevance . it has been suggested that this change may cause an artificial increase in the number of cases reported through the csr system . the purpose of the change , however , was to achieve better accuracy and more consistency in the reporting of work made possible by lsc-funding . our grantees have successfully leveraged their federal-funding by attracting other private and public-sources of funding . grantees use their mix of funding in a variety of ways . the former csr system did not consistently collect and identify much of this effort on behalf of eligible-clients . in fact , because of this inconsistency in reporting , the old system often produced artificial-variations in reported case-statistics among similar-programs . the revised reporting-requirement will greatly enhance the accuracy of the data on services to the eligible u.s. lowincome-population and will produce more complete-data on the work of grantees that can be reasonably-attributable to lsc grantees . from their submission to lsc approximately 17,000 of the insufficiently supported cases that made up the 11-percent-error rate , and ( b ) in the process of requiring more rigorous documentation of cases , some cases that actually had sufficient documentation , and many cases where the client was almost certainly eligible , were excluded , resulting in a countervailing undercount . 9 state-wide civil legal-services ' percentages of total-funding received from lsc : alabama , 91 % ; arkansas , 80 % ; mississippi , 95 % ; new mexico , 83 % ; south dakota , 89 % ; wyoming , 84 % . the span update : a

accurate-statistics on closed-cases , lsc is committed to developing and to implementing by january 1 , 2001 , a new reporting-system to document and assess the work of lsc grantees . lsc has contracted with an independent-research-firm to develop and implement a pilot-project at six lsc grantees that will gather the necessary-information needed to create a reporting-system that captures all the work of lsc grantees , not simply the traditional '' closed-cases . '' this reporting-system will detail and describe the delivery of services that are not cases , services such as community-education , information through internet-web-sites , self-help-forms and kiosks . the reporting-system may also provide information on the impact to the community and to the client by describing non- '' case '' services ' in the following-manner : Â¤ the type of innovative-service provided , Â¤ the number of eligible-clients receiving the service , Â¤ the nature of the legal-problems addressed through the innovative-service , and Â¤ the impact of the innovative-service on the legal-problems . lsc also will develop systems for measuring the outcomes ( or benefits ) of the assistance that the programs provide to eligible-clients . outcome-measurement may include an assessment of : Â¤ the monetary-impact of employment and benefits-cases , Â¤ the effect on quality of life of health and housing-cases , Â¤ the impact on minor-children of assistance in family-cases , and Â¤ the financial-stability afforded in consumer/finance cases . in addition to establishing a more complete-reporting-system , lsc is committed to using economic-analysis and performance-measures to evaluate the impact of federal-funding and individual grantee-performance . discussed below are two methods of analysis currently under review to accomplish these goals . while lsc will implement these performance-measures on january 1 , 2001 , it will diligently evaluate the chosen method of analysis prior to implementation to ensure it provides useful and meaningful-data . by 2001 , lsc will require grantees to provide information that allows lsc to comparatively analyze the cost per case among similarly situated programs and similar-types of services , i.e. , brief-advice and referral . lsc statistics for cy 2002 will reflect the input of all these performance-measures . the `` cost per case '' model : the first methodology lsc is developing and evaluating to assess the work of grantees is a '' cost-per-case '' analysis . `` cost per case '' is a rough-quantitative output-measure of the efficiency of lsc-programs ' delivery of case services to eligible-clients . in the past , it has been computed by dividing a program 's annual lsc-funding by its annual-total-cases closed . the calculation uses all of a program 's lsc-funding , even though lsc-programs provide services to eligible-clients that do not meet the definition of a `` closed-case , '' as previously detailed . while a `` cost-per-case '' analysis is limited in that it only addresses-quantity , and not quality of services , it does provide some useful quantitative-information . the raw-cost per case-figure can be further analyzed to take into account the level of service ( from brief-advice and counsel up to a court-case ) . currently , lsc uses a `` cost-per-case '' analysis when it conducts on-site-evaluations of grantees . by comparing the `` cost per case '' of a particular-grantee over a period of time , lsc may gain useful-information on the workload and performance of a program from year to year . lsc also uses a `` cost-per-case '' analysis to compare similarly situated grantees . this measure does require lsc staff to understand how services differ from grantee to grantee , so that the differences in levels of service can be adjusted to arrive at meaningful-cost-per-case-figures . for example , grantee a receives $ 30,000 in lsc-funds and serves 3,000 clients at a cost-per-case-ratio of $ 100 . the majority of these cases involve the provision of advice and brief-service , traditionally not very time-consuming or labor intensive . grantee b also receives $ 30,000 in lsc-funds , but only serves 500 clients at a cost-per-case-ratio of $ 600 . however , grantee b primarily handles clients facing domestic-violence , eviction from their residences , or issues involving-access to health care . grantee b 's cases usually involve protracted-negotiation or litigation . given the differences in the types of cases handled by these two grantees , a simple-cost-per-case-analysis , without further definition , would yield meaningless-data in terms of the comparative-value of services provide by these two programs . another caution that must be raised with this particular approach is that all lsc-funded-programs engage in a wide-range of very important-activities that do not fall within the definition of '' case , '' which would thus not be included in valuing the program's services . lsc-funded-programs use many means ( newsletters , pamphlets , speaking-engagements , and web sites ) to provide legal-information to low-income-persons , helping them avoid legal-problems or aiding them in learning to handle problems when they surface . where appropriate , lsc grantees refer low-income-persons to organizations that can help the clients with their problems - either to alternate sources of legal-assistance or to other sources of assistance , such as charitable-organizations and social-services-agencies . through the provision of legal-information , programs also assist individuals in preparing to represent themselves in court . resources expended in supporting-efforts such as community legal-education , outreach , state-planning and resource-development also would not be factored into the program 's `` cost-per-case . '' lsc is carefully studying how to refine the `` cost-per-case '' analysis in order to use it effectively as a management-tool . toward this end , lsc has recently initiated activities to develop more appropriate-strategies and mechanisms to gather and to quantify data on all of the work -- cases and matters , regardless of funding-source -- being performed by its grantees . the cases funded exclusively with lsc resources model : the second methodology lsc is developing is a model to estimate the number of cases funded exclusively with lsc-funds . to arrive at this estimate , total-cases reported by lsc grantees would be augmented with an estimate of all cases handled by lsc-funded-organizations . these are cases traditionally not reported to lsc - either because documentation lsc requires is not present in these cases or because they are expressly handled with funding that allows financial-eligibility-standards that are more lax than lsc standards . this number would then be added to the total reported to lsc ( to produce a total-caseload-number ) and then reduced by the national-rate of funding of lsc-programs by other sources . this process would yield an estimate for cases that are funded exclusively with lsc resources . in using such a number , however , several-factors need to be kept in mind . â¢ this figure would only be an estimate . we do not compile an actual-count of the number of cases that are not within lsc's definition of a case . â¢ the reportable and not reportable-cases , on average , do not take the same amount of time . other funding-sources may be funding a different-mix of cases that may , on average , take more or less time than the average-case for lsc-eligible clients . lsc will receive additional information on the ability of grantees to leverage federal-dollars using an estimate of cases funded exclusively with federal-resources , through this methodology , although it is a less than perfect-method of analysis . lsc routinely evaluates its grantees on their ability to leverage additional-dollars from alternative-sources to expand their ability to provide critical legal-services to low-income-persons . for example , as noted above , grantees often seek alternative-funding to expand services to women and children in potentially-abusive situations . further , under its state-planning-initiative that mandates all grantees within a particular-state-work together to create a comprehensive and integrated statewide-delivery-system , grantees are required to address how they will work together to expand the resources available within that state to support legal-services . vi . the need for legal-services the need for legal-services is overwhelming . although we live in a time of great economic-prosperity , there are currently still 34.5 million americans living in households with an income below the poverty level.11 some 10 million additional-individuals with incomes between 100 and 125 percent of the poverty-level are also potentially-eligible for legal-services . this means that almost one out of every five americans is eligible for legal-services assistance . america 's children are particularly affected by poverty . even though the poverty-rate has slightly declined , 18.9 percent of children are still poor.12 in order to ensure these americans are not left out of the justice-system , a strong federal-role in supporting legal-services is vital . a 1994 study for the american bar-association concluded that approximately 80 percent of poor americans do not have the advantage of an attorney when they are faced with serious-situation where a lawyer 's advice and assistance would make a difference . similar-conclusions have been reached by state legal-needs ' studies in a dozen-states including florida , georgia , hawaii , illinois , indiana , kentucky , maryland , massachusetts , missouri , nevada , new york , and virginia , using a variety of methodologies for estimating the unmet legal-needs of the poor . 11 u.s. census-bureau , poverty in the united states : 1998 , http : //www.census.gov/prod/99pubs/p60-207.pdf 12 center for budget and policy priorities , analysis of 1998 poverty and income data , ( september 1999 ) . estimated unmet legal need eligible-clients unable to attain needed legal-assistance eligible-clients served by lsc-programs -- 20 % because of limited-resources , local legal-services-programs are forced to turn away tens of thousands of people with critical legal-problems . a survey of selected programs in the spring of 1993 , when lsc-funding was substantially higher than it is today , revealed that nearly-half of all people who applied for assistance from local-programs were turned away because of a lack of program resources . most programs are forced to limit the cases they accept to emergencies or other situations that threaten the safety and stability of the family or individual involved . recent-studies estimate that between one and four million american-women experience an assault by an intimate-partner each year , and 3.3 million children are exposed to violence by family members against their mothers or female-caretakers . 13 client-demographics legal-services-clients are as diverse as our nation , encompassing all races , ethnic groups and ages . they include the working poor , veterans , family-farmers , people with disabilities , and victims of natural-disasters . many were formerly-middle class , and became poor because of age , unemployment , illness , or the breakup of a family . in 1999 , as in the past , nearly-three-fourths of lsc-clients were women , most of them mothers with children . although the named client is usually an adult , most lsc-cases also involve and benefit children . the legal-problems faced by people living in poverty can result in particularly-serious , long-term-consequences for children . 13 according to an august 1995 bureau of justice statistics special report , violence against women : estimates from the redesigned survey ( ncj-154348 ) and a report by the american psychological association , violence and the family : report of the american psychological association presidential task-force on violence and the family ( 1996 ) . elderly-people often require legal-assistance because of their special-health , income and social-needs , especially in coping with the government administered benefits on which many depend for income and health care . ethnicity white -- not of hispanic origin 38 % black -- not of hispanic origin 27 % age under 18 60 & over 2 % 18-59 85 % gender 73.6 % vii . conclusion established by congress in 1974 , lsc plays a central-role in providing low-income americans with access to legal-assistance and information critical to resolving their civil legal-problems . in 1999 , for example , lsc grantees reported closing 1,038,662 civil legal-cases relating to issues such as domestic-violence , child-custody and visitation-rights , evictions , access to health care , bankruptcy , unemployment and disability-claims , and many other issues faced by millions of low-income americans . despite lsc's significant-efforts to improve data-accuracy , there may be occurrences of errors in documentation or substance . in order to fulfill our pledge to the u.s. congress and to the general-public concerning our commitment to providing the most accurate and reliable-data , we adjusted the number of cases reported by lsc grantees ( 1,038,662 ) by the average estimated-error rate ( 11 % ) . accordingly , we submit a total of cases closed for 1999 of 924,000 . this number represents the most reliable , albeit conservative , estimate of cases closed in 1999 by lsc grantees . recognizing that valid-questions have been raised regarding the accuracy and validity of the case-service-reports ( csr ) data that lsc 's grantees annually submit , lsc has committed itself to ensuring that reliable-data is provided.14 the decrease in the number of closed-cases for 1999 is , in large-measure , the result of lsc 's new , more stringent-reporting-guidelines . for example , it has been clarified that if a case-file fails to contain any required-documentation 14 the subcommittee on commercial and administrative-law held an oversight-hearing on legal-services corporation september 29 , 1999 . the hearing heightened awareness of some of the problems lsc was encountering in attempting to provide accurate-statistics relating to services provided by lsc grantees . subcommittee chairman rep. gekas and rep. chabot informed lsc of their expectation that the statistics provided by lsc to congress concerning their grantees' activities be accurate . for example , mr. chabot stated `` congress certainly does look at the statistics that we are provided , and we expect those statistics to be accurate when we are determining what programs are going to be funded and at what levels , so we expect those numbers to be accurate , and when they 're not it disturbs us a great deal , as it should . '' legal-services corporation : oversight-hearing before the subcomm . on commercial and admin . law of the house comm . on the judiciary . 106th cong. , 1st sess . ( 1999 ) . ( financial-eligibility , citizenship/eligible alien-status , within program-priorities , etc . ) it may not be reported to lsc as a case . as a result , numerous-cases have been excluded from reporting , even though the client received legal-service , because the case lacked the required-documentation . unfortunately , the civil legal-needs of all low-income americans are not being adequately met due to severe-funding-shortages at the federal and state-level . in fy95 , congress appropriated $ 402.5 million for grants to local legal-services-programs . assuming inflation remains at current-rates through 2001 , almost $ 450 million is required in fy01 to maintain the purchasing power ( and services ) of the fy95 level . unless the federal-investment for civil legal-services is substantially increased , a large-segment of the u.s. population will continue to be without access to the justice-system . lsc 's budget-request for fy01 includes a modest-increase of $ 24 million for grants to local-programs . lsc is committed to continuing to improve the accuracy of its case-statistics , vigorously enforcing the congressional-restrictions enacted in 1996 , and creating new and more meaningful ways to evaluate the work of legal-services-programs receiving federal-funds . we call on congress , the private-bar , and local and state-governments to support lsc in fulfilling its congressional mandate to provide low-income-individuals throughout america with real , meaningful-access to our nation 's justice-system .
