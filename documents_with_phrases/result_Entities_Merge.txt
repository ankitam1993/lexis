area legal-aid entities merge by analisa nazareno july 6 , 2002 the letterhead on correspondence still bears the bexar county legal-aid name , even though the organization is no longer . texas rural legal-aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial-advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal-needs of the indigent in southwest texas , including the one in bexar county . the new 68-county legal-aid-organization has yet to be named and stretches from el paso to corpus christi , harlingen to austin . the leader for the super-sized-law-firm has big-plans . `` i 'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious-problems of poverty than the number of cases we close , '' said david hall , the trla executive director . in the rio grande valley , hall 's attorneys set up separate-groups to assist small-business-owners and residents with low-interest-loans and legal-representation . they also operate a legal-arm that assists migrant-workers from texas to kentucky . now , hall said , he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law-students who will handle less complicated legal-matters , allowing licensed-attorneys to take more '' high impact '' cases to court . `` what we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can , leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time , '' hall said . his plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal-issues . he wants to expand the law-clinic it already has with st. mary's university law-school to involve students at the university of texas law-school . the law-students at st. mary 's interview potential-clients , assist them with filling out legal-documents and answer the telephones for the legal-hotline , freeing up trla lawyers to handle the complicated-cases , hall said . by the end of september , hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county-area will be placed on the same computer-network so they can pass cases to the best-available attorneys . last year , board members on the former legal-aid of central texas and bexar county legal-aid resisted the merger , saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members . they also argued that hall 's litigious-style hampered their ability to garner funds from congress . trla generated-controversy in 1996 , when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in val verde county elections by absentee-ballot after a former ku klux klan member won a county-commissioner-post . brendan gill , the former-executive-director of the bexar county group , said he has since come to see the merger as a positive-move for south texas . `` i always knew there were good-points to merging , just as i knew that there were bad-points , '' gill said . `` now i 'm hoping to accentuate the good-points and hope that will minimize the bad-points . '' gill now heads the newly merged-group 's elder law-team . some changes , including eliminating-pay-differences between attorneys as well as staff-support-members across the state and technology-training , could be two years in the making , hall said . another issue is whether to change the name of texas rural legal-aid so that it reflects the territory 's diverse-landscape . `` overall , i think the change will be good , '' said richard loza , a san antonio attorney and the local-coordinator for the bargaining unit of the national-organization of legal-services-workers . `` i think that the poor-population in the true rural areas will benefit from more attorneys with a wide-range of expertise . someone in natalia that may not otherwise have access to an attorney for counsel or advice will be able to have that . '' since last year , hall has been meeting with nonprofit-leaders and others who expressed-concern that a merger would mean less representation for the poor in their communities . `` i know change can be difficult , but i think we need to give it a chance , '' said joyce coleman , who as director of family-violence prevention services worked with bexar county legal-aid to provide legal-assistance to women in the battered-women 's shelter . `` i think it may actually be a good thing for texas , '' coleman said . `` larger is not always better , but sometimes it can be .
