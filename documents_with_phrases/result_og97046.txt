( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 the sec prepared an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis ( irfa ) in connection with the proposed-rule , which was summarized in the notice of proposed-rulemaking ( 61 fed . reg . 68480 , 68491-92 , december 27 , 1996 ) , and was available to the public in its entirety . one comment was received in response to the irfa . the preamble to the final-rule contains a summary of the final regulatory-flexibility-analysis , a complete-copy of which was submitted to our office and was available to the public . the analysis describes the reason for the final-rule and the legal-basis for it ; descriptions and estimates of the number of small-entities affected by the rule ; a discussion of the recordkeeping , reporting , and other compliance-requirements ; and the steps taken to minimize the burdens on small-entities . the sec estimated that of the 23,350 investment-advisers currently registered with the sec , 17,650 advisers would be considered small-entities . after july 8 , 1997 , gao/ogc-97-46 approximately 850 of those small-entities would remain eligible for registration with the sec . the comment received in response to the irfa concerned the impact of the proposed-rule on small-entities that manage funds regulated under erisa . erisa protects a plan 's named fiduciary from liability for the individual-decisions of an `` investment-manager '' appointed by the fiduciary to manage the plan 's assets . `` investment-manager '' is defined by erisa to include investment-advisers registered under the advisers act . although erisa has been amended to include stateregistered-investment-advisers as `` investment managers , '' the amendment expires 2 years after enactment . when this amendment expires , small-advisers effectively will not be able to manage erisa funds . while the sec found that it would be inconsistent with the coordination act to grant an exemption for the above-described small-entities , the commissioner has written to the congressional-committees concerned urging that the sunset-provision be eliminated and the erisa exemption be made permanent . also , in response to concerns expressed , the final-rule increases the threshold for commission registration from $ 25 to $ 30 million of assets under management .
