the los angeles times lockyer warns of firms posing as legal-aid-services jocelyn y. stewart friday july 5 , 2002 state atty . gen. bill lockyer is warning californians to beware of businesses that advertise `` legal-aid '' or `` legal-services , '' only to provide costly and shoddy-services that may hurt clients in court . the warning , in a recently released consumer-alert , is a reaction to businesses that prey on the public 's trust in legitimate legal-aid-organizations . `` the true nonprofit legal-services-organizations in california provide indispensable free legal-assistance to consumers who can't afford to hire an attorney but need help while facing dangerous domestic-violence-situations , evictions from their homes and other emergencies , '' lockyer said in the alert . legal-aid-services are nonprofit , publicly funded organizations that provide services to low-income-clients at no charge or for a minimal-fee . certain-court-forms refer the poor to legal-aid . but some businesses , staffed by people who are not attorneys , have adopted `` legal-aid '' or similar-names , leading some people to believe that they are nonprofits . in los angeles , many of the victims ended up at the office of the legal-aid foundation of los angeles , a legitimate-nonprofit organization . elena popp , executive director of the foundation , welcomed the attorney-general 's alert . `` it is actually very painful for us to see people come into this office having paid $ 400 , $ 500 , $ 600 to someone to prepare paperwork that is badly done , '' said popp . `` so they 've been ripped off once by having to pay this fee and then in court by losing their case . '' in may , the attorney-general 's office filed a friend of the court-brief in support of four shasta county residents who won a case against modesto-resident walter moore , who also used the name jeff simmons . the four plaintiffs , all of whom were facing-eviction , said they were deceived into calling moore by his use of the term `` legal-aid '' in advertising . `` here we have a profit-seeking-businessman who 's not a lawyer calling himself 'legal aid ' in the yellow pages and on the internet , '' said gary rhoades , litigation-director for the housing rights-center , and lead attorney on the case . moore operated a business offering several-types of legal-services through advertisements that appeared in cities throughout the state . during the trial , former moore employees said they had been trained to tell callers they were the same `` legal-aid '' mentioned in court-forms . moore 's business charged $ 85 to $ 400 to type simple forms , rhoades said . the jury found moore guilty of violating the unlawful-detainer assistance act and of practicing-law without a license and acting with fraud , malice , or oppression . the judge determined that moore had violated california 's unfair business-practices and false-advertising-laws . in february 2001 , the judge ordered moore to pay restitution and issued a statewide injunction prohibiting moore and his associates from using the term '' legal-aid '' and similar-names . the court ordered moore to advertise the verdict in newspapers in 22 cities . the case is on appeal . to verify that a legal-aid-organization is federally funded or to find a local nonprofit legal-aid-office , consumers may refer to the legal-services corp.
