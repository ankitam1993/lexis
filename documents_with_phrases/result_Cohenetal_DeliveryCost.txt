delivery-cost-heterogeneity and vulnerability to entry* stephane bernard la poste robert cohen postal-rate commission matthew robinson postal-rate commission bernard roy la poste joëlle toledano la poste john waller postal-rate commission spyros xenakis postal-rate commission 1 . introduction virtually every post in an industrialized-country delivers monopoly-products everywhere at a uniform-price in spite of large-differences in the cost of serving different geographic-areas . this raises the possibility of an entrant competing successfully even though it has higher costs than the incumbent . a simple-example illustrates this . suppose a post serves a country composed of two areas and its cost to deliver a piece of mail in one area is five cents and is 15 cents in the other . a breakeven-post with a uniform-tariff would charge its average-cost of 10 cents a piece for delivery throughout the country . if a less efficient-entrant 's cost for serving the low-cost-area were six cents a piece , it could charge less than 10 cents in that area and be profitable . each piece of mail that the entrant delivered would raise the average-cost of delivery in the country . ceteris-paribus , inefficient-entry means that the total-resources required to deliver mail increases . * the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of la poste or the postal-rate commission if in the above example the cost had been nine cents in the low-cost-area and 11 cents in the high cost-area , it would be much more difficult for inefficient-entry to occur . delivery-cost-heterogeneity is an essential-condition for inefficient-entry and the degree of the heterogeneity would play an important role in determining the vulnerability to inefficient entry.1 the delivery-function is the most important-source of inherent cost-differences between the geographic-areas served by a post and , indeed between posts themselves . this paper explores the reasons that underlie differences in delivery-costs among geographic-areas . we do this by comparing-delivery-costs in two diverse-countries : france and the u.s. we think that international-comparisons can lead to important-insights . we first present demographic and postal-delivery-characteristics for the two countries . this leads us to develop the concept of postal-density as a measure that reflects the impact of these characteristics on delivery-costs . we examine differences in postal-density for rural areas and for densely-populated areas to identify the effect of different-delivery-practices in each country . a comparison is then made of the heterogeneity in delivery-costs for france and the u.s. we proceed to explore the relative-roles of postal-density and volume as delivery-cost-drivers . finally , we compare the engineering and econometric-approaches used to estimate unit-delivery-costs for france and the u.s. , respectively , over reasonable-ranges of the delivery-cost-drivers . the data used for the analysis are described in the appendix . 2 . some basic-comparisons it would seem that the variation of delivery-costs within the u.s. would be greater than in france . population-density in the former-ranges from very high ( new york city ) to very low ( wyoming and montana ) . france , on the other hand , has densely-populated cities but no areas as sparsely settled as in the united states.2 surprisingly , however , we will find that france has a greater variation in delivery-costs . france has 109 persons per square-kilometer and the u.s. has 30 . a greater percentage of the french-population lives in cities , while a larger percentage of the u.s. population lives in suburbs . the distance between delivery-points in france is much smaller than in the u.s. and , consequently , the modes of delivery are very different , as can be seen in table 1 . 1 the conditions for competitive-entry depend on several other factors as well [ cohen et al . ( 2000 ) , cremer et al. , ( 2000 ) ] . 2 the population-density ( people per square-kilometer ) of the five least densely-populated states in the continental u.s. are wyoming 1.8 , montana 2.1 , south dakota 3.5 , north dakota 3.6 and nevada 4.2 . the population-density of the two least populated-departments of france , creuse and lozère , is 14 persons per square-kilometer . table 1 : comparison of mode of delivery by route in france and the u.s. arounds to less than one percent bpark and loop refers to a route where the carrier-parks his or her vehicle and serves a group of houses on foot , returns to the vehicle and drives to another location where the process is repeated . cautomobile includes small-trucks . the geographic-concentration of the french-population-permits much more efficient-delivery by foot or bicycle than in the u.s.3 in france only carriers serving rural areas use automobiles but in the u.s. it is the primary-means of delivery . the quality of delivery-service is also higher in france where all delivery is to a building . in the u.s. delivery is made to buildings and also to curbside-mailboxes ( in cities and suburbs ) and to rural-roadside mailboxes . this allows the carrier to place mail in the mailbox directly from the vehicle . in addition , in u.s. rural areas carriers serve principal-roads only and residents who do not live on the carrier 's line of travel must place their mailboxes on that road . this frequently results in roadside-boxes being clustered where the carrier 's line of travel-intersects with roads not on the line of travel . these boxes are less expensive to serve than if they were spread out along the intersecting-road . unlike france the u.s. also makes extensive-use of kiosks for delivery.4 they allow more efficient-delivery because the carrier makes only one stop to deliver to several-addresses ( commercial or residential ) . this requires recipients to walk some distance from their homes or offices to the kiosk to collect their mail . eight and a half million addresses or seven percent of the total addresses served have mail delivered to kiosks . 3 . postal-density the variable-cost of delivery depends on volume delivered , thus the comparison of variable-costs between france and the u.s. is straightforward . it might seem that population-density could be used to compare differences in the fixed-cost of delivery . we have seen , however , that population-density is not the only explanation for fixed-cost differences . the fixed-cost of 3 the smaller volume per capita for france ( 320 in 1999 ) in comparison to the u.s. ( 739 ) also contributes to efficient-delivery by foot or bicycle . 4 kiosks are free standing-structures containing locked mailboxes ( as few as three or four and as many as sixty or so ) . they are called `` neighborhood-delivery centralized-box-units . '' delivery ( called route-time in u.s. delivery-cost-analyses ) ,5 is accounted for by the need for the carrier to move from one stop6 to another whatever the mode of delivery . therefore we use `` postal-density '' as the driver of fixed-costs . postal-density is the number of delivery-points that can be visited by the carrier in one hour of time , excluding-loading-time and the variable-portion of access-time and the variable-portion of travel-time to and from the route . it renders endogenous all of the physical-characteristics of the route including the mode of delivery , the `` grouping-ratio '' ( addresses per stop ) , and the difficulty of accessing the buildings.7 this measure also makes comparison possible in spite of the differences in quality of delivery service.8 delivery to a multiple-address-building or to a multiple address kiosk means that the fixed-cost of traveling to that stop is spread among the several-addresses which receive mail there . the concept of postal-density conveniently expresses the cost-consequences of both multi-address-buildings and multi-address-kiosks . we will see below that the variations in postal-density are different from variations in population-density . postal-density is a measure that contains two dimensions : exogenous-cost-drivers such as geographic and demographic-characteristics of the areas served , and endogenous drivers reflecting the quality of delivery-service . on the endogenous-dimension , postal-density could in principle be `` tuned '' by the postal-operator by adjusting-quality of service . of course , an increase in postal-density would require a reduction in the quality of service that may not be compatible with the way universal-service-obligations are defined in a country.9 3.1 comparison of french and u.s . postal-densities table 2 compares french and u.s. postal-densities at various quantiles . the french postal-density is higher at every quantile , but the ratio is strikingly high at the 95th and 90th-quantiles where it exceeds 3 to 1 . on average the french postal-density exceeds the u.s. by a ratio of 2.5 to 1 . this is somewhat less than the ratio of population-density between france and the u.s. which is 3.6 to 1.10 5 see prc docket no . r2000-1 . 6 a stop can serve one or more addresses . 7 it also gives a better view of the parts of the country that are actually populated . totally deserted-areas are not reflected in this driver . 8 we mean by `` quality of delivery-service '' such things as door , curbside or roadside-line of travel-delivery . the term as used here is not meant to include frequency of delivery . 9 the ability of an operator to adjust quality of delivery-service can be affected by the applicable postal-law in each country . for example , french-law requires delivery to the door . this level of delivery-service , treated as a universal-service-obligation in france , is primarily defined by history and tradition . thus , delivery-quality ( and therefore postal-density ) can in theory be tuned by the operator but in practice may be constrained by law . 10 part of the reason that the u.s. postal-densities have such low-values with a narrow-range may be due to stale-data . the usps determines the amount of current-carrier-time based on the percentages of time spent in route and load activities calculated with data collected in 1985 . new data may show an increase in variable-load-time to reflect the increased use of kiosks and a decrease in route-time . this would produce higher postal-densities . table 2 : postal-density-comparison with routes ranked by postal-density 3.2 rural areas postal-densities in rural areas of france and the u.s. are very different-owing to the quality of service . we have found that the postal-density in france of the 10 percent of addressees with the lowest population-density is 46 while it is 89 in the equivalent-areas of the u.s . this is remarkable in light of the much lower population-densities in the u.s . addresses in the most rural areas of france are much closer together than in the equivalent-areas of the u.s. a french-carrier must , however , turn into the farmer's driveway and proceed to the dwelling . once there , he or she must alight from the vehicle and proceed to the mailbox , then return to the vehicle , turn it around and proceed to the road . in the u.s. the carrier remains on the road , stops at a roadside-mailbox and places mail in it without leaving the vehicle.11 this contributes to the affordability of postage in the u.s. each country has made a different cost/service tradeoff , which is reflected in each country 's concept of universal-service . within the u.s. it is surprising that the average postal-density of the bottom-quartile of routes ( ranked by cost ) is lower than the postal-density for the rural-routes serving the least densely settled 10 percent of the population ( 50 versus 89 ) . this is because rural-routes in the u.s. have a higher postal-density than most park and loop-city-routes and business-routes . this in turn indicates the greater efficiency of delivering-mail to roadside mailboxes compared to walking to the front-door of a detached dwelling or business . park and loop-routes serve cities and their inner-suburbs while curbline-routes serve the outer-suburbs . thus , the postal-density of carriers ' walking between nearby-stops is lower than that of carriers ' driving between greatly separated stops . the postal-density of 89 addresses per hour for the most rural-population corresponds to roadside mailboxes that are 280 meters apart ( on average ) . many detached-houses in cities are as close as 20 meters apart . in france , the bottom-decile of routes ranked by population-density-averages 46 . the average-distance between two stops is around 400 meters , and the delivery to the door increases time between two stops . 11 moreover , on many roads served by rural-carriers , mailboxes must be placed on only one designated side of the road . this relieves the carrier from the need to travel back down a road to serve curbside-boxes on the other side of the road . 3.3 densely-populated areas at the extreme , u.s. population-densities are as high as french-population densities . for example , table 3 shows that the inner area of new york has a higher population-density than that of paris . but on average u.s. population-densities are much lower as indicated in table 3 which shows that the urbanized-area of paris is much more densely-populated than that of new york . table 3 : population and population-density in new york and parisa adata source : demographia 2001 bville de paris for paris and the borough of manhattan for new york this is reflected in the ratio of multi-address stops to single-address stops in the two countries . figure 1 displays this relationship.12 it shows the ratio of delivery-points to stops ranked by cost . at the left-side of the graph where volume is least costly to deliver we find the most multiple-address-stops . as the ratio of points to stops decreases , mail gets more expensive to deliver . la poste has a much higher ratio of multiple-address-stops than the usps . figure 1 : ratio : delivery-points to stops 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 % 40 % 45 % 50 % 55 % 60 % 65 % 70 % 75 % 80 % 85 % 90 % 95 % 100 % semi-decile of volume ( routes ranked by increasing-delivery costs ) 12 figure 1 contains data for usps city-carriers only . 3.4 comparison of variation in postal-density and volume figure 2 displays the range of postal-density and annual-volume per address that encompass approximately 90 percent of the routes in france and the united states . it shows much greater variation in french postal-densities than for the u.s. and much smaller variation in volume per address in france than in the u.s . the area of overlap is quite-small relative to the ranges for each country . the greater variation in volume per address in the u.s. is probably due to the fact that mail-volume and income are highly-correlated and the fact that the u.s. has a much larger variation in income per household than france.13 the smaller variation in u.s. postal-densities is due to differences in the quality of delivery-service which dampen the impact of low-population-density on many routes . because france has a uniform-quality of delivery , its postal-density differences are much greater . figure 2 : range of postal-densities and volumes for france and usa 3500 3000 usa 2500 2000 1500 france 1000 500 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 postal-density ( possible-deliveries per hour ) 4 . heterogeneity and relative vulnerability to inefficient-entry figure 3 displays the distribution of normalized french and u.s. delivery-costs for each semi-decile of volume ( or traffic ) when routes are ranked from least to most costly . to protect commercially-sensitive data and to facilitate comparison we display normalized-costs and not actual unit costs.14 all unit-costs are displayed relative to the mean of the distribution of unit-costs . for purposes of this analysis we discard the first and last semi-deciles for each country because the observations upon which they are based contain data of questionable-accuracy . 13 see cohen , et al. , ( 2002 ) . 14-unit-costs refer to carrier-street-time measured in seconds per delivered piece . time is an international-currency and facilitates cost-comparisons . volume ( annual pieces per address ) figure 3 : comparison of unit-delivery-costs of la poste and usps 3.00 indexed unit-delivery-costs ( mean = 1.00 ) 2.50 2.00 1.50 1.00 0.50 0.00 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 % 40 % 45 % 50 % 55 % 60 % 65 % 70 % 75 % 80 % 85 % 90 % 95 % 100 % semi-decile of volume ( routes ranked by increasing-delivery costs ) we see that the range of the french-distribution is greater than the u.s. distribution . the former begins with a cost of 0.24 ( relative to the mean ) and ends with a cost of 2.57 ( relative to the mean ) . the u.s. , on the other hand , begins with a cost of 0.33 and ends with a cost of 1.93 . the standard-deviation of the normalized french-distribution is half again as large as the normalized u.s. distribution ( 0.67 vs. 0.44 ) . thus , the french-distribution is more heterogeneous than the u.s. distribution . vulnerability to inefficient-entry can be addressed using delivery-cost-heterogeneity . some indicators of vulnerability are : the percentage of the volume that has a unit-cost less than half the mean , the size of the area between actual-costs and the average-cost , and the average-slope of the cost-curve . these are based on the conjecture that an entrant would seek to compete where the unit-delivery cost was very low while using the uniform-tariff as an umbrella-price . these measures of vulnerability make sense , of course , only with a uniform-tariff-constraint , and more generally when geographical-cost oriented-tariffs are not applied . figure 3 reveals that in france 33 percent of the volume has a cost less than half the mean while in the u.s. only 20 percent of the volume is below this threshold . ceteris-paribus , france is more vulnerable to inefficient-entry . another relevant-factor would be the geographical-concentration of the low-cost-volume . we believe that the low-cost-volume is scattered over perhaps a hundred or more u.s. metropolitan areas while in france the volume is concentrated in relatively few cities . thus , it would be far easier for an entrant to market its alternative-service in france than in the u.s . in addition , france has about half the per capita-volume of the u.s. giving it less economies of scale . this means that the consequence of volume-erosion would be greater in france than in the u.s . there are , of course , other relevant-factors affecting entry such as wage-premium , efficiency of operation and classification efficiency.15 15 see cohen , et al. , ( 2002 ) . figure 4 compares french and u.s. traffic and french and u.s. postal-densities when routes are ranked by cost . we see that in both countries the volume for the least costly-areas is approximately twice that of the most costly-areas . thus , the volume range for both is about two to one . the range of postal-density is much greater for both countries . the maximum is eleven times the minimum for france and 4.5 times the minimum for the u.s . the greater variation in french postal-density leads to a greater variation in french-unit costs relative to the u.s. as discussed below , the lower french-volume magnifies the impact on unit-cost from the variations in postal-density . figure 4 : volume per delivery-point and postal-density 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 % 40 % 45 % 50 % 55 % 60 % 65 % 70 % 75 % 80 % 85 % 90 % 95 % semi-decile of volume ( routes ranked by increasing-delivery costs ) the different-ranges in postal-density and volume when routes are organized by cost rather than organized by postal-density or volume ( as displayed earlier in figure 2 ) demonstrate the interaction of postal-density , volume , and delivery-costs . in particular the actual-volume ranges shown in figure 2 are much greater than the two to one ratios observed in figure 4 . figure 4 displays an interesting-phenomena in that for the most costly 35 percent of the routes the postal-density in france is lower than in the u.s . this is due to the fact that in the u.s. the most sparsely-populated areas do not correspond to the highest cost-routes . this is partly explained by the line-of-travel requirement , which greatly reduces the cost of delivery in areas with low-population-density . moreover , in the u.s. the routes with the lowest postal-density are not the routes with the lowest traffic.16 in france , on the contrary , routes with the lowest postal-density have the lowest volumes . this also explains why there is greater heterogeneity in costs in france than in the u.s. 16 this is probably linked with a wealth-effect , as volumes are driven by the wealth of the recipient ( see kolin and davis ( 1999 ) , berthelemy and toledano ( 2000 ) ) . 5 . interaction of the cost-drivers in this section we examine the impact of changes in postal-density and volume per address on the average-cost in each country . french-average-costs are derived from an engineering-model mentioned in the appendix and described in detail in roy ( 1999 ) . the u.s. average-costs are derived from an econometrically estimated-translog-equation of street time.17 the equation relates street-time to volume per address , postal-density , and the number of addresses . the number of addresses is set as a `` control '' variable in the equation , allowing us to develop average-costs . table 4 presents la poste and usps normalized-street-delivery costs for each combination of quartiles of low , medium and high postal-densities and volumes per address . data for each country are presented , with the u.s. values immediately below the french values . postal-density in france is higher than in the u.s. in all quartiles and ranges from 78 addresses/hour at the low-quartile to 256 addresses/hour at the highest quartile . this range of postal-densities is much greater than the corresponding u.s. range of 67 to 140 addresses per hour . the annual-volume per address is higher in all quartiles , and its range is wider in the u.s. table 4 . 1999 la poste and usps index of average costs* low postal-density ( pd ) medium postal-density high postal-density % change la poste ( 78 addresses/hour ) ( 135 addresses/hour ) ( 256

st=β0+β1lnq+β2 ( lnq ) 2+β3lnd+β4 ( lnd ) 2+β5lnb+β6 ( lnb ) 2+β7 ( lnq ) ( lnd ) + β8 ( lnq ) ( lnb ) +β9 ( lnd ) ( lnb ) where : st = street-time q = volume ( pieces per address ) d = postal-density ( addresses per hour of fixed-time ) b = addresses the translog-equation was estimated using 1999 data from 39,737 rural-routes and a stratified-sample of 8,300 city-routes . table 4 shows that in both countries-volume is a more important-cost-driver at low postal-density than at high postal-density . this is because , ceteris-paribus , at low postal-density the fixed-costs are higher and the potential for scale-economies is therefore greater . conversely , at high postal-densities the fixed-costs are lower and thus the potential for scale-economies is not as great . similarly , postal-density is a more important-cost-driver in both countries at low-volume because at low-volume the savings in fixed-costs realized from increasing postal-density are spread to fewer pieces . conversely , postal-density is a less important-cost-driver at high volume because the savings from an increase in postal-density are spread across a greater number of 1300 pieces . 2200 44 it should be noted that the impact of postal-density on cost is greater in france than in the u.s. since france has a wider range of postal-densities and lower volumes . in contrast , the impact of volume is greater in the u.s. than in france because the u.s. has lower postal-densities and a greater variation in volumes . finally , postal-density appears to be a more important-driver of unit street-delivery-costs than volume over the actual-ranges in france and the u.s. 6 . unit-cost behavior the la poste simulation-model and the cost-function developed for the usps , described above , provide alternative-means of estimating average-unit-costs over a range of volumes per delivery-point and postal-densities . figure 5 displays average-costs generated with the la poste unit-delivery cosst ( sec/piece ) simulation-model and data for french postal-activities . figure 6 displays the average-unit-costs generated with the cost-function for the usps . figure 5 : unit-delivery-costs as a function of volume and postal-density derived from la poste delivery-cost simulation-model 90 60 30 yearly-volume per address possible-deliveries per hour ) figure 6 : unit-delivery-costs as a function of volume and postal-density derived from a translog-model with usps data the remarkably-similar shapes of the two surfaces demonstrate a convergence of simulation and regression-approaches to estimating the behavior of delivery-costs with postal-density and volume per address as cost-drivers . the difference in unit-delivery-costs values reflect different-input-prices in the two countries . the figures visually demonstrate the relationship between low postal-density and/or low-volume and high average-unit-costs ; and conversely the relationship between high postal-density and/or high volume and low average-unit-costs . also , the figures exhibit the rapid-change in unit-delivery-costs as either volume or density increase . however , once either high volume or high density is achieved , the opportunities for further reductions in average-unit-costs by increases in either volume or density are minimal . 7 . conclusions the analysis of delivery-costs for france and the u.s. demonstrates that street-delivery-costs are more heterogeneous in france than in the u.s. ceteris-paribus , france is more vulnerable to inefficient-entry than the u.s . the heterogeneity of delivery-costs is driven by differences in volume , geographical-characteristics and quality of delivery-service . the concept of postal-density captures the nonvolume factors in a single-measure . rationalizing street-delivery-cost by decreasing the quality of delivery-service can have a profound impact on the postal-density and consequently , on delivery-cost . due to this rationalization of delivery-cost in the u.s. , the postal-densities of the most sparsely-populated areas are higher than the densities of the most sparsely-populated areas of france . postal-density appears to be a more important-driver of unit street-delivery-costs than volume over the actual-ranges in france and the u.s . furthermore , high postal-densities reduce the impact of volume on unit street-delivery-costs , and high volume reduces the impact of postal-density . appendix : delivery-data france the delivery-data for la poste are obtained for each delivery-area . a delivery-area represents a postcode ( or several-postcodes in some cases ) . the territory is divided into nearly 6000 delivery-areas . each area-averages 12 routes ( with of course a very high deviation ) 18 . the unit-costs ( expressed in seconds and normalized as explained ) are estimated by an engineering model19 to allow for simulations over variations of traffic . they are obtained the following way : the information-system allows the description of each area with geographic-characteristics ( population , number of stops , number of delivery-points , surface , length of streets or roads ) and traffic . the delivery-model constructed by la poste uses hundred of parameters , and allows the calculation of the unit-costs of street-delivery with an error of less than three percent in each area . at this stage , one unit-cost is calculated for each area . it gives a quite aggregate-view of street-costs compared to the fineness of u.s. costs . in reality , each area is quite heterogeneous : it generally consists of a small-town and an outlying-area with different geographical-characteristics . to have a more precise-view of unit-costs ( and to have a better level of comparison with u.s. costs which are by route instead of by geographic-area ) , the costs are then divided into two groups per area . we finally obtain 12,000 unit-costs in 12,000 areas.20 the subareas are then ranked on the criteria of increasing-unit-costs . they are re-aggregated into increments of five percent of traffic : the first five percent of traffic delivered is reached with 23 areas , and the last five percent of traffic is obtained with 900 areas . u.s. u.s. delivery-data are from the city-carrier-cost system and the rural national mail count system.21 city-carriers make up 72 percent of the routes and rural-carriers make up the remainder.22 the city-carrier system contains a stratified-sample of 8,300 routes and the 1999 rural national mail count system provides data on 39,737 rural-routes . the data-elements used in this study are : the number of addresses served ; the number of stops ; ( for city-carriers only ) volume per address , and address per kilometer ( for rural-carriers only ) . city-carrier-time is derived from the usps cost-segments and components report for fy 1999 and the average-time is 18 paris has 20-delivery-areas and more than 1000 routes , and many delivery-areas , like in lozère only have one route . 19 see roy 1999 `` a technico-economic-analysis of the costs of outside-work in postal-delivery '' . this model is used in the cost-accounting system to determine costs by products . 20 these sub-areas represent an average of six routes per area . 21 see prc docket no . r2000-1 . 22 approximately 30 percent of rural-routes serve non-rural urban-suburbs . calculated and used for all city-carrier-routes . rural-carrier-time is included in the rural-mail count system . variable and fixed-costs we divide out-of-office-delivery-costs into their components using the method developed by the u.s . postal service.23 load-time is included in the variable-costs . for simplicity the variable-portion of access and travel to and from the beginning of the route are ignored . the remaining-time is fixed and includes the time between stops ( route-time and the fixed-portion of access ) and the fixed-portion of travel-time . 23 see prc docket no . r2000-1 .
