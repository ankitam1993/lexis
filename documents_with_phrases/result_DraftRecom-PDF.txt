discussion of draft-recommendations daniel hungerford opened the final-session of the conference by outlining the group 's ultimate-task-to create research-recommendations from conference-deliberations . before the conference , he and daniel pollock drafted-recommendations for the steering-committee to consider . during the conference , the steering-committee modified those recommendations , and they were distributed to attendees for general-discussion . hungerford stated that the goal of the conference was not to achieve unanimity regarding the recommendations , but to have significant and general-agreement . he indicated the process would be to discuss the recommendations one by one , identifying any gaps or omissions and offering general-comments . he emphasized that the sequence of the recommendations did not imply a priority-order . because the published recommendations will include supporting-text , he encouraged the group to consider any points of clarification that would be instructive . hungerford then opened the floor for discussion . recommendation # 1 research on screening and intervention should address the full-spectrum of alcohol-problems among ed patients . richard brown remarked that in many circles , `` intervention '' does not necessarily include referral , so he suggested that the first recommendation include `` referral . '' also , he said the phrase '' alcohol-problems '' does not always include risky-drinking and problem-drinking , so he suggested adding `` risky and problem-drinking '' to the recommendation . daniel hungerford noted that the supporting-text could provide detail on the spectrum of alcohol-problems . he suggested the main-point of the first recommendation was that research-efforts should include the whole-continuum of alcohol-problems , not just a portion of the continuum such as alcohol-dependent-drinkers . jean shope advocated that the definition of `` the full-spectrum of alcohol-problems '' include primary-prevention . she recommended this under-standing be made explicit in the final-document . gordon smith suggested that the recommendations should address the problems of poly-substance-abuse . carl soderstrom wondered whether `` alcohol-problems '' referred to the spectrum of drinking-problems or the medical-problems associated with drinking . herman diesenhaus pointed out that hazardous-drinking causes a complex-set of problems that include personal , social , and legal-problems in addition to medical-problems . the phrase `` alcohol-problems '' includes all those problems as well as the hazardous-drinking . he noted that different-pieces of the solution will lie in the medical-realm and in the social-welfare-realm . he expressed-concern about how to reflect this complexity in the recommendations . guohua li suggested changing the phrase `` among ed patients '' to '' in the emergency-setting '' because alcohol-problems are not limited to patients . perhaps the recommendations should address-alcohol-problems among providers and physicians . stephen hargarten thought that the term `` alcohol-related-problems '' would appeal to clinicians more than `` alcohol-problems '' because they see those problems in their practices . he said that including `` related '' in terms gives the sense of broadening them . richard ries said he did not believe that screening for alcohol neuropathy was intended to be part of the recommendation . he suggested that the recommendation be clear that it is addressing-alcohol use disorders or problems , not for medical care consequences . hungerford replied that screening for specific medical care consequences was not part of the recommendation , but that consequence-items may be used in the screening . he added that broad screening would identify people with medical-conditions as well . he found that screening with a low-cut-point on the audit identified more people with severe-alcohol-problems and alcohol-dependence than did not using a uniform-screening-method . he agreed that this issue needs clarification in this recommendation . richard longabaugh said that the term `` alcohol-problems '' implies that the patient 's problem is consumption . he favored '' alcohol-related-problems '' because consumption is not the problem . the problem is the consequences resulting from excessive-drinking . elinor walker endorsed the notion of using `` the emergency-care-setting '' rather than `` the ed '' particularly to include focus on the pre-hospital-care-setting . hungerford added that the trauma-care-setting should be included as well . li added his support to `` alcohol-related-problems , '' but suggested another alternative , `` problem-drinking , '' which is commonly used . edward bernstein pointed out that the recommendations would likely stand alone for readings and come without context . with that in mind , he suggested listing the full-spectrum of alcohol-problems , from risky-drinking to alcohol-abuse to alcohol dependency . he felt that it would be a mistake to open this set of research-recommendations with a recommendation that included screening for withdrawal or other conditions . another possibility would be to say , `` the full-spectrum of alcohol-misuse . '' recommendation # 2 screening-instruments under consideration for use in eds should be evaluated as a component of protocols that provide interventions for patients . robert woolard supported the recommendation and noted that most research on screening has involved an evaluation of screening , but not an intervention . trying to apply those findings to a clinical-setting , where there is the question of training and the link between the screening-instruments and the intervention , becomes problematic . enough research has been conducted on instruments alone , he said , and new research should link screens with interventions . linda degutis recommended amending the recommendation to read , '' screening , interventions , and methods under consideration . '' then in the supporting-text , she suggested addressing the different-people who might be doing the screening and the need to tie it to intervention . longabaugh wondered whether the intended-consumers of the document would include government officials , researchers , practitioners , and academicians . hungerford answered that the summary of the conference would be published in an emergency-medicine-journal and that readers would include these groups . daniel pollock added that the message of the recommendations could also be conveyed at professional-meetings . the goal was to influence-people who are in a position to make changes in the field . brown believed the recommendation was worded too strongly . to him , it was saying that work should not include screening-research in isolation . he noted that little is known about effective screening for certain-sub-populations , so screening-research still has its place . although he agreed that a total-research-portfolio should have a strong-emphasis on intervention and not just screening . diesenhaus described his use of a slogan and abbreviation for a treatment-strategy , `` screening , brief-intervention , and referral-sbir . '' research on the individual-components is important , but the strategy for the emergency-room-setting is as follows : screen , decide if a brief-intervention is called for , and if not , give a referral . emergency-setting personnel need to understand all three components and how they are linked . he was not sure if '' referral '' could be included every time , but acknowledged that it is a vital-part of the work . hungerford emphasized that research on screening is needed . however , he believed-research on screening-instruments that is not linked with an intervention leads to the easy-assumption that results will be generalizable to using that screening-instrument in a full-protocol . the second recommendation , therefore , is intended to point out that results from the screening-literature are not necessarily-generalizable to real-world settings in which screening would be paired with interventions . ries suggested that defining `` sbir '' upfront might help clinicians understand the recommendations better . if we do not , a clinician who is interested in seizures or pancreatitis could easily misread the wording of this recommendation . to avoid that , for this recommendation we would have to say something like , '' problematic alcohol-use screening-instruments under consideration for use in the ed should be evaluated as a component of protocols that provide alcohol-use-interventions for patients to decrease problems or use . '' hungerford said he understood . if we do not pre-define `` sbir , '' we have to define what we are talking about with each recommendation . if we do define `` sbir '' upfront , we make the reading more understandable and more efficient . gail d'onofrio noted that in this context , we use `` referral '' to mean sending a patient to a specialized-treatment-facility . however , in emergency-medicine , everyone gets a referral-to-primary care , a clinic-follow-up , or another health or social-service . the '' referral '' in sbir could include both meanings . hargarten 's initial-understanding of this recommendation was that screening-activities for alcohol-problems should be integrated with the screening and interventions the ed does for a whole-range of problems . he suggested that the recommendation be worded in such a manner that this effort does not seem to be a parallel activity . hungerford proposed that just as screening-research should be carried out in the context of protocols that include interventions , those protocols should be integrated with the whole-system of ed operations . christopher dunn thought the word `` evaluate '' made this recommendation vague . what would be evaluated-the-usefulness of a screen or the psychometric-properties of a screen ? he believed that the screen can have an interventive-effect , so he wanted-research on whether patients fare as well with a screen as they do with brief-advice or more sophisticated-techniques . david fiellin advocated eliminating the second recommendation . to him the statement implied that screening-instruments should be evaluated only as a component of protocols that provide interventions . he believed that the statement was dangerous because there are research-methodologies that are related to evaluating screening and separate-ones related to evaluating-interventions , and we may not want to obligate tying the two together . thomas babor supported technical-research on screening and the wording of this recommendation . however , he raised a larger issue-the moral-imperative of screening . he said that screening sets up the expectation that something has to follow . without screening , there can not be much-intervention . he noted that the recommendation could be seen as a way of driving widespread applications of interventions . if that is the goal , he thought we should be examining how to accomplish screening . there are large obstacles to screening , and practical-research on screening-implementation , incentives , efficiency , and its ability to reach large numbers of people at low-cost is necessary . he believed in a public-health-approach to screening which means we would not do it if the yield is low . he suggested that the technical-aspects of screening were not as fruitful-topics for research as how to screen the greatest number of patients at the lowest cost . bernstein suggested that the recommendation not be eliminated , but rewritten to reflect the discussion . pollock and hungerford concurred . hungerford added that the intent of the recommendation was not so much that integrating the screen with the intervention gave better estimates of the performance-characteristics of the screen , but that it would redress the imbalance between research emphasizing the performance-characteristics and research on operational and practical-characteristics . recommendation # 3 interventions that have shown promise in other clinical-settings should be adapted to and evaluated in emergency-departments . charles bombardier wondered whether the recommendation should limit evaluation only to interventions shown to be effective in other settings . there might be interventions developed specifically for the ed that would be worthwhile to test . walker thought the goal of this recommendation was to de-emphasize fine-grained , developmental-work and to emphasize pursuing-work using available-interventions . woolard noted that the effectiveness of screening , brief-interventions , and referrals has been proven outside the emergency-department , but not yet in the ed . therefore , he hoped that the supporting-text for this recommendation would include statements about the need for a large , multi-center-trial in eds . longabaugh noted that new and creative-interventions may be developed in the ed that the rest of the field will want to adapt and explore . walker made a plea not to adopt the abbreviation `` sbir '' because it is already used to designate small business innovation research grants by federal-agencies . it could be very confusing . she suggested `` sir '' instead . smith returned to the idea of linking-alcohol-interventions with the other interventions in the ed . if there were a package of interventions that providers could document and be reimbursed for , that would ease acceptance by practitioners and help institutionalize these new practices . documentation would also help ensure interventions would not be repeated unnecessarily . pollock pointed out that proving the cost-effectiveness of a specified , well-described-service in a clinical-setting is a critical-consideration in moving a new practice from a research endeavor to a reimbursable-service . whether the service emerges as an adaptation from primary-care or as an innovation from the ed is less important than whether it can be evaluated to the satisfaction of those who make key-decisions about whether it becomes part of standard-practice . larry gentilello asserted that effective-treatments already exist , not just treatments that `` hold-promise . '' the `` promise '' has to do with the intervention 's likelihood of success in the ed , not with its success in other settings . he suggested that the wording be made less tentative : for example , `` treatments that work should be made to work in the ed . '' catherine gordon proposed that the recommendations address the issue of financing and suggested the following-phrase , `` research should also identify the most effective and cost-effective interventions and delivery-mechanisms ( e.g. , provider-types or technologies ) . '' she said this type of information is absolutely critical for insurers . pollock asked gordon whether research on alcohol-interventions had to be done in a specific clinical-setting in order for interventions provided in that setting to qualify for reimbursement . he also asked how medicare distinguishes between prevention and treatment for the purposes of authorizing reimbursement . gordon explained that because medicare is prohibited by statute from covering preventive-services , it must draw a distinction between treatment and prevention . the kind of information-insurers require to cover these services includes necessary-frequency of treatment , types of providers best suited to provide treatment , an ironclad-case that the intervention is effective , a consensus in the professional-community around the intervention , and an ability to guard against the potential for fraud and abuse . pollock added the notion that demonstrations of effectiveness in primary-care-settings , in the eyes of policymakers and payers , are not tantamount to demonstrating-cost-effectiveness in emergency-departments , underscoring the importance of research in that setting . gordon agreed . recommendation # 4 research is needed to evaluate the effects of legal , privacy , confidentiality , regulatory , and human-subjects-issues on screening and interventions for alcohol-problems among ed patients . brown praised the recommendation for addressing a very important-issue . however , he thought the human-subjects-aspect might not belong , because human-subjects-issues will not affect screening and intervention on a daily basis in the clinical-setting . they only affect research-studies . bombardier suggested that in addition to evaluation , this research should develop ways to mitigate legal , privacy , and confidentiality-problems associated with screening and treatment . ann mahoney said the recommendation should be worded to focus on systems as well as individuals . for example , she indicated that the concerns institutional and professional-systems have about reimbursement or legal , privacy , and confidentiality-issues influence whether ed patients receive screening and interventions . hargarten commented that this area has the potential to cause consternation and divisiveness , so it will require a great deal of textual-commentary to tease out the important-issues that it addresses . he noted that alcohol-screening in the ed is currently being discussed on the `` ethics-circuit . '' he suggested that perhaps ethics should be added to the recommendation . recommendation # 5 research is needed on how demographic and cultural-attributes of ed patients , practitioners , and interventionists influence the success of screening and interventions for alcohol-problems . hargarten said there should be some reference in the recommendations to the high-risk-environment in which these people live and work and visit the ed . he wondered if this recommendation was the appropriate-place . marilyn sommers noted that different clinical-settings can profoundly influence how screening and intervention is delivered . she cited-differences between level i trauma-centers and community-hospitals . she suggested that the influence of setting be made explicit somewhere in the recommendations . alison moore indicated that these differences can also influence how researchers and clinicians-tailor interventions to apply to people with different cultural-attributes . li suggested that co-morbidity or patients ' medical characteristics could also have a large-impact on the success of interventions . recommendation # 6 research is needed to identify the factors that foster the organizational and practitioner-behavior-changes needed to institutionalize screening and intervention for alcohol-problems among ed patients . walker urged that this research not be confined to academic medical-centers , but be designed and carried out in partnerships with other stakeholders , particularly community-level-providers . she believed that this should be in the recommendation , not just supporting-text , because reviewers would want to know how screening and intervention can be implemented into clinical-practice when considering-grant-applications . robert lowe suggested a range of research-topics could come under this recommendation . who should do interventions in the ed ? how should ed interventions be linked to the primary-care and public-health-systems ? which services should be provided in the ed and which should be provided elsewhere ? how can referrals be effectively accomplished ? how can interventions be paid for ? he suggested-wording for the supporting-text for this recommendation . `` research in this category may address a broad-range of organizational-issues-from the structure of alcohol and screening treatment-services within the ed to the relationship of the ed to other sources of primary-care and the organizational and fiscal factors affecting that relationship . this research is crucial as the field progresses from evaluating-efficacy in research-settings to examining-effectiveness in the current , complex-health-care delivery-system . '' babor supported lowe 's revision and suggested adding the word '' implementation '' to the recommendation . research is needed on how to implement and institutionalize these programs . factors to be explored range from practitioner-behavior and practice-guidelines to policy-changes that are needed to facilitate implementation of screening and intervention in these settings . if this recommendation is too narrowly defined , we will encourage people to look at small-things like training-programs . however , no matter how strong a training-program is , if there are no incentives for practitioners to use the training or the legal-restrictions are insurmountable or the health-care-system is in total-chaos and you can not find who is in charge of the department because somebody has bought out the hospital , you will have difficulty implementing an intervention . peter rostenberg noted that most trauma-care is delivered in community-hospitals , and practitioners in that setting often do not relate to level i trauma-care research . therefore , he supported including-community-hospitals in research-efforts . he thought the biggest barrier was how to change the culture in the ed so that staff would ask screening-questions . ries thought that the recommendations should encourage studying outcomes that are important to medical-personnel , such as health care-outcomes and recidivism , rather than alcohol-use-outcomes . hargarten related that a recent-survey found that almost one-third of academic-eds have faculty in community-settings . he thought that encouraging this linkage in research-proposals could help increase this proportion . he also suggested that involving opinion-leaders in the field of emergency-medicine could help reduce the lag-time between academic-research showing the effectiveness of an intervention and broad-implementation in non-academic , clinical-settings . patricia perry believed that the recommendation was not yet comprehensive . hospital administrators merit-mention because they are key to wide-implementation . she thought-state and federal-policymakers should also be included in the statement . she observed that institutionalizing new practices was just the beginning of the task . once they are in place , the program-needs to be maintained . she wondered what factors influenced-maintenance . pat lenaghan suggested that clinicians need recommendations about what could be accomplished now . they need to know that screening-works and that the sooner screening is implemented the sooner-patients with alcohol-problems can receive help . she noted that collaboration with community-groups and public-health-agencies is appropriate for alcohol-problems because they are not just present in the ed . she said that such collaboration has contributed to the success of domestic-violence screening across the country . bombardier noted that barriers exist among departments within institutions as well as among institutions . he advocated developing-information systems that follow patients so that data collected in the ed can be used later . ronald maio suggested defining the unique-role of the emergency-department in the overall-picture of treating-alcohol-problems . what can the emergency-department do that can not be done in other settings ? soderstrom suggested that the term `` practitioner '' in this recommendation needs to be clarified because it can mean anyone who takes care of a patient , including rns , mds , therapists , and others . bernstein noted that alcohol-dependent-patients clearly need specialized-treatment and that some patients with hazardous-drinking need out-patient-counseling . he said if access to that counseling is not available , screening and interventions are less likely to happen in the ed . he called for research on barriers emergency-physicians face in getting further care for ed patients with alcohol-problems . hargarten wondered about supporting-text that calls for policy-relevant-research to institutionalize and to promote organizational-changes . he suggested that research on ways of paying for these services could be an important-factor in promoting and institutionalizing-changes . recommendation # 7 research is needed to explore and define the role of information technology in facilitating-screening and intervention for alcohol-problems among ed patients . brown asked whether other forms of technology should be included , such as audio-tape-headsets . janet williams suggested the phrase `` information and communication-technology . '' she said that these technologies can assist in follow-up and continuity of care . ries commented that educational-videos in waiting-rooms can be helpful . hargarten added that tele-medicine has a role in making the booster-intervention a reality . recommendation # 8 funding-agencies should support research on screening and interventions for alcohol-problems among ed patients and make the mechanisms of research-supportknown to potential applicants in emergency-medicine . longabaugh wanted the recommendation to include research training as an explicit-component . he said that it has been difficult to get good , physician-applicants for brown's post-doctoral-program in intervention and treatment-research . however , the program has produced a great deal of research . mechanisms to facilitate the training of good-researchers , particularly-ones from emergency-medicine , are needed and should be encouraged . hargarten added that training-mechanisms should not be limited to physicians . he suggested including-nurses and phds . diesenhaus noted that agencies are required to fund different types of research . samhsa funds applied-research , and their application-pro-gram is oversubscribed . brown felt that the recommendation placed too much responsibility on funding-agencies . he suggested the recommendation encourage the emergency-medicine academic-organization to help its members find other funding-opportunities . he thought there were many opportunities through other organizations that should be tapped . gentilello said he has long supported placing a priority on research in this area . however , funding-agencies can not be forced to accept this . he agreed with brown that professional-societies should be clear about funding-opportunities . at the same time , the data indicate many missed opportunities for treatment in the ed . for some patients , the ed visit is the only contact with the medical-care-system . it can be their only opportunity for intervention , and injuries are the most common-events that bring people into contact with the emergency-department . we can present a strong-case that work in the ed should be a high priority . pollock suggested that ed visits are crucial-opportunities , and the supporting-text for this recommendation can make that clear . it is possible to emphasize this topic without stating that it should take precedence over other issues or have a certain-amount of resources devoted to it . hungerford thought that work in the ed needed a higher priority and more resources if the field is to move forward . pollock asked for a more specific-definition of '' prioritization . '' it is unfortunate , but in the eyes of funders , it is perceived as a zero-sum-game . bernstein suggested that the supporting-text for this recommendation would have to explain the need for political commitment to changing the health and social-outcomes resulting from alcohol-problems . hargarten suggested that we do not have to ask federal-agencies to make research on alcohol-problems in the ed a high priority . instead , we could recommend that , compared with other settings , the prevalence of alcohol-problems among ed patients makes it worthy of careful-consideration . we can also recommend that research-efforts should include an ed focus and that emergency-medicine-experts should be included in the grant-review-process . this strategy would attempt to broaden the focus of current-research-activities to include the ed . longabaugh commented that an niaaa effort to conduct research on spirituality and addiction came about by setting-aside-funds specifically for this topic . he said the way to accomplish this is to find and work with agency-staff interested in the topic . he believed that data on the prevalence and severity of alcohol-problems in eds can have a major-impact . ries agreed and suggested that this recommendation should promote ed-based-research by emphasizing the large number of ed patients affected by alcohol-problems and the significant-health care-impact of those problems . fiellin suggested the recommendation should ask for a level of support that is commensurate with the burden of illness . gentilello pointed out that the literature includes 40 randomized-trials on brief-interventions in family and general-practice settings . three ( one in press ) are in emergency-medicine . the emergency-department at harborview probably sees 50 times as many patients with alcohol-problems as the psychiatry or family-medicine departments . if we were to choose one place to set up a screening-system to find people who need interventions , it should be the emergency-department . he said there needs to be a shift in priorities . mary dufour described how niaaa sets research-priorities . to secure some funding for this conference , she had to `` compete '' with other conferences , which indicates that this issue is high on the niaaa list of priorities . niaaa has a national advisory council with a subcommittee that helps to set research-priorities . interacting with the council is an important way to influence research-priorities , she said . every three to five years , niaaa reviews its whole-research-portfolio ; it identifies gaps , which become research-priorities . alcohol and injury , as well as brief-interventions , are on the list . niaaa is a small-institution with more priorities than money . brown suggested that the recommendation remain as is , but that the supporting-text list ways that priorities could be changed . because drug-use is also an important-issue among ed patients , he thought combining-alcohol and drug-research in eds could lead to more research-dollars . he noted a growing-understanding of the importance of screening for alcohol and other drugs together . to appeal to nida , he said , the referral-aspect of the research should be strong because of their focus on treatment . diesenhaus agreed that both support from staff in an agency and the `` burden of illness '' argument could be influential . he said that demand for research in eds from outside an agency would also be important . he suggested that conference-participants needed to interact with individuals and groups that influence policy . gentilello acknowledged that there is a demand-problem . the goal is to help trauma-surgeons and emergency-physicians realize that dealing with alcohol-problems is an integral part of their job . research on alcohol-problems is as important as research on sepsis and cpr . at the nih web site , he found no information on alcohol-related-research in the surgery-section . it was all in the alcohol-section , which surgeons do not explore . if we want surgeons to become interested , it should be repeated in the surgery-section . longabaugh remarked that nih is increasingly trying to individualize the routing of grant-applications so that study-section members are a matter of public-record . if a study-section does not include a relevant-expert , then a cover-letter with the grant-application can request such an expert . li suggested that adding a reference to the healthy-people 2010 objective to reduce alcohol-related-injury and ed visits by 15 % might enhance the rationale for more research . general-comments about the recommendations after participants had given extensive-feedback on specific proposed recommendations , hungerford asked if they had general-comments about the recommendations overall . fiellin reflected on increasing-information about the biological basis for addictive-disorders , the increasing-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy , and the fact that we are trying-look at these disorders the same way we look at chronic medical-conditions like hypertension and diabetes . he asked whether we might initiate pharmocotherapy for patients with alcohol-related-problems in the ed , much like we initiate use of oral-hypoglycemics and anti-hypertensives with some type of follow-up .
