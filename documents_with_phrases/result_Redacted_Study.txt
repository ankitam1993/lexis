( in column 1 , compare line 2 and line 5 ) . the balance of outbound and inbound-accounts would change from - $ 44.7 million to - $ 153.9 million , implying an increase of $ 109.2 million in international-mail expenses ( see column 1 , lines 3 , 6 , and 7 ) . and combined would account for percent of the increase in the ic terminal-dues net-balance . would account for $ million and would account for $ million . this is due partly to the relatively high domestic-rates for these two countries compared to u.s. domestic-rates and partly to the disparity in the mail-volumes exchanged between the u.s. and these two countries . and are among the three largest recipients of u.s. outbound-mail , the third being . u.s. outbound-mail to and exceeds the inbound-mail from each of those countries by about a -to-one ratio . thus , the imbalance in the volume of mail exchanged magnifies the effect of the relatively higher rates in these countries . actually sent more mail to the u.s. than it received . basing-terminal-dues on domestic-postage would have the opposite effect on the exchange of mail with developing countries . table 1 shows that the u.s . postal-service 's payments to dcs would increase from $ million to $ million ( in column 2 , compare line 1 to line 4 ) , while dc payments to the u.s . postal-service would increase from $ million to $ million ( in column 2 , compare line 2 to line 5 ) . thus , the expenses associated with the exchange of international-mail to and from dcs would decrease by about $ 50.2 million under a domestic-postage-based terminal-dues-system ( see column 2 , line 7 ) . overall , considering both the negative-effect on expenses associated with the exchange of mail to the ics and the positive effect on expenses associated with the exchange of mail to dcs , the implication of this analysis is that a switch from the terminal-dues-system in effect in fy 2000 to a domestic-postage-based-system would have a negative-effect on the postal-service of about $ 59.1 million ( column 3 , line 7 ) . this amount represents 7.4 percent of the revenues raised from international-postage-rates applicable to lc and ao mail dispatched to foreign postal-administrations ( excluding canada ) . this result is valid to the extent that the assumptions concerning the weight-profile of the mail , and the applicability of first-class-rates to such mail , are valid . in addition it should be noted that the terminal-dues changed on january 1 , 2001 . the terminal-dues that the u.s . postal-service paid to ics and collected from ics during fy 2000 essentially-equal the terminal-dues in effect on january 1 , 2001 . however , the terminal-dues between ics will increase gradually over a three-year-period , implying different-results for subsequent-periods . another change beginning on january 1 , 2001 is a new 7.5 percent surcharge on payments to dcs by ics . the monies generated by the surcharge flow into a common-pool to be parceled out to dcs by the upu for quality of service-improvements . the commission chose the actual fy 2000 results as a convenient-benchmark for measuring the effect of a domestic-postage-based terminal-dues-system . for this reason , fy 2000 actual results were not restated to reflect the effect of the surcharge . however , the effect is relatively-easy to calculate . the 7.5 percent surcharge would have added $ million to the fy 2000 terminal-dues cost ( 7.5 % x $ million ) in table 1 , line 1 , column 2 and column 3 . this would also increase line 3 , columns 2 and 3 by $ million . thus , the u.s . postal-service 's fy 2000 net-terminal-dues shown at line 3 , column 3 would increase by $ million from $ to $ . since the surcharge would not apply in the `` domestic-postage '' scenario , none of the figures in lines 5 to 7 would change . table 1 , line 7 , column 3 shows the difference between the u.s . postal-service 's actual net-terminal-dues in fy 2000 ( - $ 113.8 million ) and if the terminal-dues in fy 2000 had been based on domestic-postage ( - $ 172.9 million ) . the difference is - $ 59.1 million . since the 7.5 percent surcharge on dc payments would have decreased the fy 2000 net-terminal-dues to - $ , this also would reduce the net-balance under a domestic-postage-based-system from - $ 59.1 million ( - $ 172.9 minus - $ 113.8 ) to - $ million ( - $ 172.9 minus - $ ) . effect on cost-coverage and institutional-cost contribution . table 2 below displays the revenue , attributable-cost , contribution to institutional-cost , and cost-coverage for ( 1 ) actual fy 2000 and ( 2 ) fy 2000 adjusted to reflect a domestic-postage-based-payment system for the exchange of mail among countries . it should be noted that table 2 includes the revenues and attributable-costs for the volume of mail exchanged between the u.s . postal-service and canada even though this study did not consider a change in terminal-dues rates with canada , and canada is the largest market for u.s. international-mail . table 2 effect of replacing terminal-dues with domestic-postage on international-mail 's contribution to institutional-cost and

line 3 shows that in fy 2000 , outbound-mail had a contribution to institutional-costs of $ 456 million . the corresponding-amount for inbound-mail was a negative $ 31 million . it should be noted that this raises an important-policy-issue . inbound-mail could be viewed as a subclass of mail . by law , subclasses of domestic-mail must produce revenues equal to or exceeding attributable-costs . international-mail as a whole produced a contribution of $ 375 million . lines 5 through 8 show the effect of changing the method of payment for the exchange of lc/ao mail between the u.s. and all other fpas . changing the terminal-dues-system affects the u.s . postal-service 's inbound-revenues and its outbound-attributable costs . thus comparing-line 1 , column 2 to line 5 , column 6 , shows that inbound-revenues increased from $ 291 million to $ million , while comparing-line 2 , column 1 to line 6 , column 5 shows that attributable-costs increased from $ 1,030 million to $ million . the net-effect on the u.s . postal-service 's international-mail-finances is to reduce the contribution to institutional-costs from $ 375 million to $ 316 million , a reduction of $ 59 million . this amount reflects the net-increase in the terminal-dues net-balance that the u.s . postal-service would experience under a domestic-postage-based-system , as expected ( see table 1 , column 3 , line 7 ) . it should be noted that had the 7.5 percent surcharge on dc terminal-dues been in effect in fy 2000 , the contribution under the current-terminal-dues system would have been $ million lower and the reduction in contribution from shifting to a domestic-postage-based-system would be $ million compared to $ 59 million above . the cost-coverage for u.s. outbound-mail , without considering the 7.5 percent surcharge , would be reduced from 144.3 percent to percent and the cost-coverage for inbound-mail would increase from 90.4 percent to percent . combining-outbound and inbound-mail , and including incremental-costs would result in an overall-cost coverage of 119.8 percent compared to the fy 2000-cost-coverage of 126.7 percent . if the u.s . postal-service wanted to recover the $ 59 million in lost contribution , it could increase the rates on outbound lc/ao mail , excluding-outbound-rates to canada , by 7.5 percent . alternatively , if it wanted to maintain the fy 2000 overall-cost coverage of 126.7 percent , the u.s . postal-service could increase those same rates by at least 13.9 percent . there are , of course , other contribution or cost-coverage-goals that could be selected . reliability of the analysis . there are four critical-inputs to this analysis : ( 1 ) the distribution of outbound-mail by weight-interval , ( 2 ) the distribution of inbound-mail by weight-interval , ( 3 ) u.s . postal-service domestic-postage-rates , and ( 4 ) fpa domestic-postage-rates . the distribution of outbound-mail by weight-interval . like the rates of the u.s . postal-service , the domestic-postage-rates of fpas vary by weight-interval . thus , the analysis requires a distribution of outbound-mail by weight-interval . as part of its annual-submission of data and workpapers to the commission to support the commission 's report to congress on international-mail , the postal-service provided the fy 2000 billing determinant data for outbound-mail . this data include volumes by the weight-intervals associated with the u.s . postal-service 's rates for outbound international-mail . because the data are not maintained by individual-country , except for canada and mexico , it was not possible to develop a weight-interval-distribution for outbound-mail unique to each destination fpa . the commission , therefore , assumed that the weight-interval-distribution for all outbound-mail sent to all fpas , excluding canada , was a reasonable-proxy for the weight-interval-distribution for mail sent to each fpa . this distribution is applied to the actual-number of pieces sent to each country in fy 2000 . thus , distortion could enter the analysis of u.s. outbound-mail if there are differences between the proxy-distribution and the actual-distribution . the commission believes it unlikely that this would have a meaningful-impact on the calculation of terminal-dues based on fpa domestic-rates . the distribution of inbound mailby weight-interval . the analysis also requires a distribution of piece-volumes by weight-interval for inbound-mail . the commission , by a letter to the postmaster general , requested this distribution from the postal-service . the postal-service responded that the information does not exist . however the postal-service did provide as much-detail as is collected a volume-distribution by transportation-mode and shape for sixty individual-countries . in the absence of data showing the weight-distribution of inbound-mail , the commission employed , as a proxy-distribution , data developed by european postal-administrations in the course of preparing a new terminal-dues-system . the european-system , called reims ii , relates terminal-dues to domestic-postage . this distribution represents the aggregate-distribution for the reims ii countries . the reims ii countries are all industrial-countries , so the distribution is likely a reasonable-approximation for mail received by the u.s . postal-service from industrial-countries . developing a distribution for inbound-mail from dcs is more problematic . the commission was not able to obtain any data on developing countries . generally , lc mail is lighter than ao mail . further , studies by the universal postal union indicate that the average-weight for each shape ( envelope , flat , packet ) of mail sent from dcs to ics is 10 to 30 percent less than the average-weight of mail from ics to ics . hence , it appears likely that the proportion of lc to ao mail is less for inbound-mail than for outbound . in the absence of specific-data , however , the commission assumed that the reims ii data would be a reasonable-proxy for dcs also . this assumption seems likely to result in an overstatement of the domestic-postage that would be collected on inbound-mail . the magnitude of the overstatement can not be estimated with confidence . as noted , the reims ii data was separated by shape : letters , flats , and small-packets . because the u.s . postal service's available-inbound lc/ao volume-data is reported separately for surface and air , the commission applied two separate reims ii distributions . for air lc/ao mail , the distribution for all shapes was used because inbound-air lc/ao contains all shapes . for surface lc/ao mail , the distribution for flats and small-packets combined was used for two reasons . first , the volume of inbound-surface letters is negligible . second , the average-weight per piece was 6.9 ounces in fy 2000 . this implies that the surface-mailstream is composed of flats and small-packets . these distribution-keys appear to reasonably reflect the distribution of inbound of mail , subject to the caveats above . the reims ii data did not identify the volume of cards . because there are inbound-cards , the commission assumed that the relationship between u.s. outbound-cards and the total-volume of outbound air lc/ao mail applies to inbound-mail-air lc/ao . the reasonableness of the assumption is unknown . the selection of u.s. postalservice domestic-rates . based on field-observations and some discussions with u.s . postal-service field-personnel , the commission determined that no inbound-mail would be likely to meet the eligibility-requirements for domestic bulk-business-rates . thus any inbound-mail-piece would pay the first-class-rate , or the priority mail rate for items weighing more than 13 ounces . although inbound-books and records might be eligible for the media mail-rates , the amount of this mail is minimal . for these reasons , the commission has applied the u.s . postal-service 's domestic-rates for first-class and priority mail to the inbound-mail-distribution described above . of course , if the u.s . postal-service made available domestic bulk-business-rates to fpas , fpas might prepare inbound-mail so that it would meet the eligibility-requirements . the commission 's analysis does not take into account this possibility . however , because the discounts for bulk-mail are cost based , any lost-revenues should be offset by corresponding reduced-costs . the selection of fpa domestic-rates . to obtain fpa domestic-rates , the commission used the available fpa web sites . the commission identified 21 sites with rates for industrial-countries and eight sites with rates for developing countries . because u.s . postal-service first-class/priority rates were applied to inbound-mail , the commission tried to identify the corresponding-rates for the fpas . identifying these rates was problematic because many countries do not have first-class-rates for heavy-mail . u.s. outbound lc/ao mail weighs up to 22 pounds . to fill the gap in missing fpa rates , the commission calculated an extra-ounce-rate between the two highest weight-intervals for which there were rates . ( the difference between the rates divided by the number of grams in the weight-interval ) . the proportion of volume covered by this extrapolation-procedure ranges from 0.1 percent to seven percent . although this approach seems reasonable , there is a potential for substantial-overstatement or understatement because the amount of estimated domestic-postage-based terminal-dues calculated under this procedure represents 4 percent of total ic-payments to fpas and 14 percent of total dc payments . the potential distortion is unquantifiable at this time . the commission also assumed that the average-revenue per piece for the 21 industrial-countries whose rates were available applied to the remaining 5 ics whose rates were not available . similarly , the commission assumed that the average-revenue per piece for the 8 developing countries with available-rates applied to the remaining 203 dcs without available-rates . the latter-assumption is probably weak , but there is currently no way to improve upon it . potential-improvements to the study . in this study , the commission has sought to provide its best estimates within the time provided . the analysis so far suggests the following-possibilities for further study : industrialized-countries . first , it would be to desirable to develop a separate-estimate of the international-mail-revenues associated with outbound ic mail . this would allow an estimate of the effect on international-postage-rates of shifting to domestic-postage-based terminal-dues in the exchange of mail between industrialized-countries . the use of domestic-postage-based terminal-dues appears most feasible among industrialized-countries . second , it would be informative to divide the ic mail-exchange into lc and ao components . lc mail is the most profitable-mail and the mail to which first-class domestic-postage-rates are most likely to be applicable in the future . it seems likely that u.s. and foreign-mailers would prepare ao mail so that it would qualify for lower domestic-rates applicable to printed matter and/or lower priority-delivery . hence , a separate-estimate of the financial effects of shifting from terminal-dues to domestic-postage-rates for lc mail is likely to identify the most significant , persistent , and predicable-effects of a shift to domestic postagebased-terminal dues . to divide ic mail into lc and ao components , we need further data from the postal-service or to make additional-assumptions . third , our estimate of the revenue from inbound ic mail could be improved by a specific-study of the weight-distribution of inbound-mail received from ic fpas , by class of mail . our use of reims ii data as a proxy for this distribution appears plausible , but no more . fourth , we need to obtain the domestic-postage-rates for new zealand and israel , the only significant-outbound ic mail-flows omitted from this analysis . developing countries . the first improvement needed in regard to dc mail is a specific-study providing the weight-distribution of inbound-mail received from dc fpas , by class of mail . this would allow a plausible-estimate of the revenue the postal-service would receive by applying domestic-postage-rates to such mail . our use of reims ii data as a proxy for this distribution was necessary , but not realistic . second , further work would likely allow us to develop , for a higher percentage of outbound dc mail , ( 1 ) estimates of the domestic-postage-costs that would be incurred if the postal-service paid domestic-postage instead of terminal-dues and , ( 2 ) the outbound-mail-revenues associated with such mail-flows . in this effort , we would anticipate focusing on the most significant postal destinations among the dcs rather than trying to analyze each and every destinating dc . the commission is attaching a disk with the electronic-spreadsheets and a hard-copy-explanation of the procedures used . the u.s . postal-service considers the terminal-dues amounts contained in table 1 commercially-sensitive . the u.s . postal-service also considers the data in the electronic-spreadsheets commercially-sensitive because they contain country-specific-data . if you have any questions , please contact bob cohen ( 202-789-6850 ) or charles robinson ( 202-789-6854 ) . with best wishes , sincerely , george omas vice chairman
