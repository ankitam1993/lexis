legal-aid in civil-matters is important florida lawmakers are quickly moving through legislation to provide legal-aid for needy-families dealing with civil-litigation . when indigent-citizens get in criminal-trouble , public-defenders are made available by law . but civil-issues involving-family-law , domestic-violence , immigration , financial or housing-problems can undermine a person 's employment and destabilize a family in short-order . so it is not just compassionate to ensure that legal-services of this type are available ; it is also in the broader interest of communities and society . and an exemption -- - that the money would n't be used to fight dui charges -- - is completely appropriate . though some $ 10 million a year would probably fill the bill for civil legal-aid in florida , just $ 500,000 is in the state's strained-budget at this time . prior to the welfare-reform-legislation , some federal-resources were available for civil legal-aid -- - that and the vast-amount of pro-bono-work by private-attorneys . that 's about $ 170 million a year from florida lawyers alone . it had been hoped to use surplus federal-funds earmarked for transitional-welfare-programs as part of the welfare-reform movement , said florida bar president terry russell of fort lauderdale . but those funds wound up set aside for other uses at the same time as florida faces a budget-crisis . florida is one of just 11 states that provide no such funding whatever , so it 's to lawmakers ' credit that hb 491/sb 512 have unanimously passed out of every house and senate committee to date . naples republicans dudley goodlette in the house and burt saunders in the senate , both attorneys , are being supported by our area reps. bev kilmer , curtis richardson and will kendrick and by sens . al lawson and richard mitchell . the legislation is restricted at this point to , most likely , pilot-programs with the department of community affairs contracting with groups such as the florida bar-foundation to distribute the money most effectively . and much depends upon the availability of funds at the march 8 revenue estimating-conference , which will give lawmakers the latest figures on how much they can spend in the 2002-03 budget . where there is a will , there is a way , however , and lawmakers have made the vital first step of declaring their determination to extend to the indigent the availability of legal-representation in civil-matters .
