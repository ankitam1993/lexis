( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 , and 609 epa has certified that the final-rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities because , using the size-standard of fewer than 750 employees , only four firms would be considered small-entities . the cost of the clean-water act portion of the rule for these entities only exceeded 1 percent of revenues for one of the facilities and in no case did it exceed 3 percent . epa gao/ogc-98-45 estimates that the impact of the clean-air act maximum achievable-control-technology portion of the rule in combination with the clean-water act portion is that one facility owned by one of the four small-entities may close as a result of the combined impact . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 epa has determined that the final-rule , while not imposing a federal-mandate that will result in the expenditure of $ 100 million or more in any one year , will impose such a mandate on the private sector . therefore , in compliance with section 202 of the unfunded-mandates reform act , epa prepared a written-statement , including a cost-benefit-analysis , assessing the impact of the rule , which is summarized in the preamble to the final-rule . a complete-copy of the statement was furnished to our office as part of the economic-analysis . while epa determined that the rule will not significantly or uniquely affect any state , local or tribal-governments , epa consulted with state and local-air and water-pollution-control officials primarily regarding-implementation-issues . section 205 of the act requires agencies to identify and consider a reasonable-number of regulatory-alternatives and to adopt the least costly , most cost-effective , or least burdensome-alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule . the preamble discusses the alternatives considered and why epa believes that the alternative selected is the least costly and least burdensome consistent with the requirements of the clean-water act and the clean-air act . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the final-rule was issued-pursuant to the notice and comment procedures contained in 5 u.s.c . § 553 . on december 17 , 1993 , epa published a notice of proposed-rulemaking on the integrated-air and water-rules in the federal register . 58 fed . reg . 66078 . on february 10 , 1994 , epa held a public-hearing so interested parties could present their views on the proposed-rule . on march 8 , 1996 , a notice of proposed-rulemaking was published concerning the air portions of the rule . all during this process , epa issued many notices of data-availability and held other meetings with numerous industry stakeholders , trade-associations , environmental-groups , states , and other interested parties . in the preamble to the final-rule , there is extensive-discussion of the comments submitted and the actions and changes to the proposed-rule that epa made as a result of its consideration of the comments . page 2 gao/ogc-98-45 paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the final-rule contains collections of information which are subject to approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) under the paperwork reduction act . the preamble to the final-rule contains the required-information regarding the collections , including the legal-basis and reason for the collections , the number of respondents , and an estimate of the annual-burden-hours . epa estimates that there are approximately 490 respondents that are affected by the air-emission-rules and must submit an initial applicability-notification . of these 490 respondents , an estimated 155 respondents would be required to perform additional information-collection . this results in an estimated-burden of 320 hours over the first 3 years after promulgation at a 3-year cost of $ 29,600 per respondent . the collections have been sent to omb for approval and the requirement is not effective until approved by omb and a control-number is issued . statutory-authorization for the rule the final-rule was issued-pursuant to the authority of sections 301 , 304 , 306 , 307 , 308 , 402 , and 501 of the clean-water act , 33 u.s.c . §§ 1311 , 1314 , 1316 , 1317 , 1318 , 1342 , and 1361 , and sections 112 , 114 , and 301 of the clean-air act , 42 u.s.c . §§ 7412 , 7414 , and 7601 . executive-order no . 12866 the final-rule was determined to be an `` economically-significant '' regulatory-action by the office of management and budget . it was reviewed by omb and approved as meeting the requirements of the order . page 3 gao/ogc-98-45
