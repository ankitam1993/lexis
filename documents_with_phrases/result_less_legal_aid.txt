cuts in federal , private-funds mean less legal-aid wednesday , august 28 , 2002 by susan skiles luke illinois ' poor will have less access to free-lawyers-thanks to a recent-one-two-punch : a cut in federal-funding for the state's biggest free-law-clinics and a drop in a statewide-fund that pays for legal-aid . the three groups that deliver most of the legal-aid to the poor in illinois will lose about $ 920,000 in congressional-funding annually , said eric kleiman , a spokesman for legal-services corp. , the washington-based-agency that distributes federal-money for legal-aid . the lsc allocates money to states based on the number of poor counted in the last-census . the 2000 census showed illinois with about 35,000 fewer people who are eligible for lsc services because of low-income , about $ 22,000 a year for a family of four , kleiman said . the three agencies are the legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago , rockford-based prairie state legal-services and alton-based land of lincoln legal-services . the cuts will take the biggest bite out of land of lincoln , a network of eight offices and 40 lawyers who help clients in southern illinois with problems like eviction , access to social-security and obtaining-orders of protection from abusive-spouses . the agency , which gets more than half of its $ 5 million budget from the lsc , will lose $ 525,000 , said executive director joseph bartylak . some lawyers will likely be laid off , and agency-officials will meet this week to discuss whether to cut services , bartylak said . land of lincoln helped tasha johnson of marion get social-security-benefits to support her four children after the 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with non-hodgkin 's lymphoma , a type of cancer , she said . her application had been rejected three times . `` they 're known for helping-people , '' she said . although the three groups deliver most legal-aid in illinois , dozens of other programs offer similar-services and all will feel the pain when the lawyers trust-fund of illinois doles out grants for 2003 . the fund , created by the illinois supreme court in 1983 , gets interest from escrow-accounts and other money-lawyers often keep for their clients and spends it on legal-aid . this year , the fund will likely award just half of the $ 3.5 million it usually gives some 34 groups statewide , said ruth ann schmitt , the trust-fund 's executive director . the illinois general assembly has appropriated about $ 500,000 annually for legal-aid in recent years , an amount-bartylak said has not been much reduced . still , of the nation 's 10 most populace-states , illinois ranks last in the amount of money-legislators appropriate for legal-aid , lsc president john erlenborn said earlier this year . sheldon roodman , executive director of the legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago , said the work these groups do is critical . `` ( they take ) cases like preserving an elderly-person 's home being foreclosed because of a predatory-loan , '' roodman said , `` or an illegal-eviction of a person who will become homeless . if people do n't have access to the courts , somebody who has the upper-hand takes advantage .
