office of the general counsel b-274798 october 17 , 1996 the honorable john h. chafee chairman the honorable max baucus ranking minority member committee on environment and public works united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : environmental-protection agency : control of air-pollution : final-rule for new gasoline spark-ignition marine-engines ; exemptions for new nonroad-compression-ignition-engines at or above 37 kilowatts and new nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by environmental-protection agency , entitled `` control of air-pollution : final-rule for new gasoline spark-ignition marine-engines ; exemptions for new nonroad-compression-ignition-engines at or above 37 kilowatts and new nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts '' ( rin : 2060-ae54 ) . we received the rule on september 10 , 1996 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on october 4 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 52087 . the rule regulates exhaust-emissions from new spark-ignition ( si ) gasoline marine-engines including outboard-engines , personal-watercraft engines and jet-boat-engines beginning with the 1998 model-year and the rule is fully phased-in by the 2006-model-year . the regulation of these emissions became necessary under section 213 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the clean-air act , as amended , when epa found that these nonroad-engines were significant-contributors to ozone or carbon-monoxide-concentrations in more than one nonattainment-area . a nonattainment-area is a gao/ogc-96-45 specified area that has failed to attain the applicable national-ambient-air quality-standard for a given pollutant . in addition , the rule exempts new nonroad-compression-ignition-engines at or above 37 kilowatts and new nonroad-sparkignition-engines at or below 19 kilowatts . enclosed is our assessment of the environmental-protection agency 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by sections 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the environmental-protection agency complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact james vickers , senior-attorney , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the environmental-protection agency is peter guerrero , director , environmental-protection issues . mr. guerrero can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-6111 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : mr. thomas e. kelly , director office of regulatory management and information environmental-protection agency page 2 gao/ogc-96-45 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . §§ 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the environmental-protection agency entitled `` control of air-pollution : final-rule for new gasoline spark-ignition marine-engines ; exemptions for new nonroad-compression-ignition-engines at or above 37 kilowatts and new nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts '' ( rin : 2060-ae54 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis epa has prepared an analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule which is contained in the regulatory-impact-analysis . the analysis explains the methodologies and the reasons behind their use in arriving at the cost and benefits of the rule . in achieving the rule 's goal of a 75-percent-reduction in hydrocarbon-emissions by the year 2025 , such a reduction will also contribute to the reduction of volatile organic-compounds and ozone in ozone attainment-areas . the epa finds that the benefits of a 590,254 tons of hydrocarbons reduced per year by the rule more than offsets the increase in oxides of nitrogen of 25,440 tons per year which will result . the annualized-costs associated with the rule in 2006 will exceed $ 370 million , which is 7 percent of the projected expenditure on these engines in that year . the average-increase in cost for the engines would be 10-15 percent or $ 700 per engine . the analysis contains tables which show the annual-cost from 1998 , the effective-date of the rule , until the year 2051 , by which the epa expects the entire existing-fleet of these engines to have been replaced , to be $ 15.5 million to $ 336.2 million , respectively . the cost-effectiveness of the rule has been calculated by epa to be approximately $ 1,000 per ton of hydrocarbons reduced . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 in the preamble to the notice of proposed-rulemaking ( 59 fed . reg . 55966 ) , epa concluded that the rule would have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities , especially in view of epa 's implementation of the act , which considers any impact a significant impact . gao/ogc-96-45 however , in the preamble to the final-rule , epa has now determined that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . this change is due to the deletion from the rule of the regulation of stern-drive and inboard engines , which are mainly manufactured by small-entities . epa believes that , at most , there are only two firms which manufacture outboard or personal-watercraft and jetboat-engines that qualify as small-entities . epa notes in the preamble to the final-rule that it has reduced the burdens where possible on these small-entities following consideration of the comments received . epa states that it has taken into consideration the potential competitive-impact on these firms and has eased the burden by permitting averaging-emissions across product lines , reduced production-line testing , reduced in-use-testing , simplified certification-procedures and allowing manufacturers to purchase emission-credits from the market place as an alternative to employing-control-technologies to meet the standard . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 based on the cost-benefit-analysis performed by epa , the rule will not impose an intergovernmental-mandate because there are no enforceable-duties on state , local or tribal-governments . however , the rule will impose a mandate on the private sector in excess of $ 100 million in any one year . epa has prepared both a qualitative and quantitative-assessment of the benefits and costs of the rule in the regulatory-impact-analysis . epa has considered numerous regulatory-alternatives to the final provisions of the rule , which are discussed in the summary and analysis of comments , but has determined that the requirements expressed in the final-rule constitute the most cost-effective and least burdensome-alternative that would meet the mandate of section 213 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the clean-air act . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . instead of the notice and comment procedures in the administrative procedure act , the epa promulgated this rule using the procedures , which have similar-notice and comment-requirements , contained in section 307 ( d ) of the clean-air act , as amended . ( 42 u.s.c . § 7607 ( d ) ) . the use of these procedures regarding-rules pertaining to nonroad-engines or vehicles is mandated by section 307 ( d ) ( 1 ) ( r ) of the clean-air act . page 2 gao/ogc-96-45 epa published a notice of proposed-rulemaking on november 9 , 1994 ( 59 fed . reg . 55930 ) requesting-comments on the proposed-rule . on february 7 , 1996 , epa published a supplemental-notice of proposed-rulemaking ( 61 fed . reg . 4600 ) to refine some of the proposals made in the prior-notice and to respond to comments which had been received . in the preamble to the final-rule ( 61 fed . reg . 52090 ) , epa discusses the changes made in the proposed-rule in finalizing the rule and advises that the significant-comments received and epa 's responses-thereto are available to the public in a summary and analysis of comments-document . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule contains information-collection-requirements which are subject to the paperwork reduction act . epa originally submitted eight information-collection requests ( icrs ) to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for approval under the act in connection with the notice of proposed-rulemaking . omb originally denied all eight requests but subsequently approved two of the requests . epa has resubmitted all eight requests based on reduced reporting and recordkeeping-requirements resulting from changed-requirements in the final-rule . epa notes that it has taken steps to reduce the administrative-burden as much as possible and in the final-rule estimates that the burden for the collection of information under all eight icrs would average 6,900 hours annually for a typical-manufacturer . the icrs contain the information required by the act including the reasons for the collection of the information , the type of information and an estimate of the burden imposed on respondents . epa has solicited-comments on the proposed information-collection-requirements to be sent to both epa and omb for consideration during the approval-process . the information-collection-requirements of the rule will not be effective until omb-approval is obtained . statutory-authorization for the rule the epa has cited sections 202 , 203 , 204 , 205 , 206 , 207 , 208 , 209 , 213 , 215 , 216 , and 301 ( a ) of the clean-air act , as amended , ( 42 u.s.c . §§ 7521 , 7522 , 7523 , 7524 , 7525 , 7541 , 7542 , 7543 , 7547 , 7549 , 7550 and 7601 ( a ) ) . in particular , section 213 of the act ( 42 u.s.c . § 7547 ) requires the administrator of epa to regulate emissions from nonroad-engines and vehicles and to issue-regulations containing-standards applicable to emissions from these categories of new nonroad-engines and vehicles . executive-order no . 12866 omb reviewed the rule under executive-order no . 12866 as a '' significant regulatory-action . '' the office of information and regulatory affairs of omb approved the page 3 gao/ogc-96-45 final-rule as complying with the requirements of the order based on the information supplied by epa , including a planned regulatory-action-document describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary-impact of the rule . page 4 gao/ogc-96-45
