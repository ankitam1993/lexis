rural-delivery and the universal-service-obligation : a quantitative-investigation robert h. cohen william w. ferguson spyros s. xenakis postal-rate commission office of technical analysis and planning july 31 , 1992 1 . introduction 1.1 . scope and purpose it is widely believed that it costs more to provide rural areas with postal-service than urban-areas . this belief is based primarily on the perception of a cost-differential between rural and city delivery.1 this perception is one of the bases for the argument that a universal-service-requirement is necessary to assure the continuation of rural-delivery or at least the level of service currently accorded rural areas.2 the purpose of this paper is to analyze rural-delivery-costs and compare them with city-delivery-costs . using routine-cost-data submitted in the course of postal-rate-proceedings , section 2 of this paper compares the cost of rural and urban-delivery , section 3 shows the relationship of rural-delivery-cost to population-density , section 4 analyzes the `` profitability '' ( viz. , contribution to overhead ) of serving rural areas , and section 5 presents some concluding-remarks and a brief-summary . before turning to section 2 , some background-information on rural-delivery and city-delivery is offered . the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of the postal-rate commission . 1 according to the 1991 comprehensive-statement on postal-operations ( p. 66 ) , usps delivery-costs represent 30 percent of total-costs ; window-service and mail-processing , 32 percent ; transportation , 7 percent ; and administrative , building-occupancy , and all other , 31 percent . 2 this paper focuses on the detailed-comparison of delivery-costs , between rural and urban-areas . it does not purport to show the bearing , if any , this cost-analysis might have on questions regarding the complex-issue of the postal-monopoly , which encompasses many issues beyond the scope of this paper . 1.2 . relation of rural-routes to demographically designated rural areas the postal-service has about three times as many city-delivery-letter routes as rural-routes . city-delivery-routes serve geographic-locations within the boundaries of a post-office , while rural-routes generally serve areas falling outside these boundaries.3 city and rural-carriers are in separate-labor-unions , and their compensation is determined separately based on different factors . the united states census-bureau ( 1990 data ) reports that slightly under 25 percent of the 250 million people living in the united states live in rural areas.4 the remainder live in urban locations.5,6,7 in 1991 , the united states postal-system provided service to 102 million-delivery-points . city-routes served 78.5 million and rural-routes ( including-contract-routes ) served 23.4 million delivery points.8,9 a total of 95 million-delivery-points 3 united states cities and the areas served by their post-offices often expand to absorb surrounding-areas served by rural-routes . it takes a great deal of time to administratively convert a rural-route to a city-delivery-route . thus , some rural-routes will serve areas annexed by cities and their post-offices . 4 bureau of the census press release , cb91-334 , dec. 18 , 1991 . 5 as defined for the 1980 census , urban-areas include : ( a ) places of 2,500 or more inhabitants incorporated as cities , villages , boroughs ( except alaska and new york ) and towns ( except in the new england states , new york and wisconsin ) , but excludes those persons living in the rural-portions of extended-cities ; ( b ) census designated places of 2,500 or more inhabitants ; and ( c ) other areas , incorporated or unincorporated , included in urbanized areas . all non-urban-areas are rural . 6 the census-bureau reports that in 1980 there were 6,619 incorporated places with more than 2,500 inhabitants . in 1991 , the united states postal-service provided-city-delivery to 6,625 post-offices , but not all were in incorporated areas . 7 the united nations has estimated that 27.5 percent of the population in the more developed-nations would live in rural areas in 1990 . see world population trends and policies , 1987 monitoring report , the united nations , department of international economic and social affairs , population division , page 176 . 8 comprehensive-statement on postal-operations , 1991 , p. 49 . 9 highway-contract-routes ( star-routes ) are similar to rural-routes . the difference is that the carrier is a contractor to the postal-service , not an employee . contract-routes serve 1.4 million-delivery-points . are residences ; the remainder are businesses . thus , rural ( and highway-contract ) routes serve slightly less than 25 percent of total residential-delivery-points ; this is the same as the percentage of the population living in rural areas . 1.3 . description of rural and city-delivery all rural-routes use-vehicles to deliver to a box placed along the roadside , and virtually all provide six-day-a-week-delivery . a rural-route is defined in terms of the roads it traverses . homes or businesses not located on one of these roads must place a mail-receptacle along the route traveled . for this reason , boxes will frequently be clustered where a rural-route intersects roads not on the route . in this sense , rural-service is inferior to city-delivery where service is provided to ( or in close-proximity to ) each building served . most city-delivery-routes are `` park-and-loop '' routes . the carrier on these routes uses a vehicle to drive to various-points along the route where the carrier-dismounts and delivers to a portion of the route on foot . some city-delivery-routes , called '' curb line-routes , '' use-vehicles to provide curbside-delivery to a mail-receptacle along the curb as is done by rural-routes . a third type of city-delivery-route is the `` foot-route . '' city-routes are further categorized as `` business , '' '' residential , '' and `` mixed '' ( business and residential ) routes . business-routes ( consisting of at least 70-percent-business deliveries ) , which account for less than one percent of all possible city deliveries,10 are five-day-per-week-routes . mail on all other city-routes is delivered six days a week . very few routes service-businesses or residences exclusively . for example , on residential-routes ( which account for 94 percent of all possible-city-deliveries ) , businesses account for five percent of possible-deliveries . the percentage of possible-deliveries on rural-routes that are businesses is not known . although the activities of city and rural-carriers are similar , some minor-differences exist : -rural carriers spend about three percent of their total-time providing retail-services 10 '' possible-delivery '' is used to describe a household or business address ( including-apartments and suites ) to which mail might be delivered by city-carriers . `` box '' is used to describe the receptacles each family or business sets up on a rural-route to which mail might be delivered . the two terms stand for similar concepts and for purposes of this paper are used interchangeably . ( e.g. , selling-postage-stamps , rating and receiving-parcels , etc . ) ; -city carriers provide no retail-services ; -rural carriers transport mail to and from small-post-offices along their route ; and -city carriers sweep more collection-boxes along their routes than do rural-carriers . 2 . comparison of the cost of city and rural-delivery 2.1 . comparison of carrier-time required to serve city and rural areas table 1 shows that the average-time per day per possible-delivery is 1.04 minutes for city delivery11 and 1.07 minutes for rural-delivery . ( this small-difference would be further reduced if retail-activities of rural-carriers were not counted . ) the virtual equality of the average-carrier-time to serve urban and rural-customers is a major-finding of this paper . part of the explanation for this finding can be inferred from table 1- businesses require considerably more time per possible-city-delivery than do residences . the average possible-delivery on business-routes requires five times as much-carrier-time as the average possible-delivery on residential-routes . there are several-reasons for this large difference in carrier-time : -businesses receive almost three times as many pieces per possible-delivery as do residences . the statistics shown in table 1 ( row 2 ) reflect both in-office and out-of-office delivery time.12 in-office-time is closely related to volume . -in business-areas , carriers travel by foot , and many deliver in large-office-buildings to individual-suites . 11 this analysis includes only city-delivery-letter routes . it excludes parcel-post and support-routes which primarily serve business-districts in larger cities . 12 city and rural-carriers typically spend between three and four hours in the office preparing for delivery . table 1 selected statisticsa for city-delivery and rural-delivery-routes ( 1989 ) city item residential park & foot curb loop city residential , business all businessb and mixed rural park & total all foot curb loop total 1 . possible deliveries11.5 15.1 46.9 73.4 0.6 12.6 15.7 49.7 78.1 20.5 ( millions ) 2 . minutes per day per possible-delivery 1.00 0.83 1.01 0.97 5.55 1.21 0.85 1.06 1.04 1.07 ( in-office and out-of-office ) 3 . seconds per piece13.24 9.54 12.93 12.22 21.44 14.78 9.69 12.98 12.50 14.94 ( in-office and out-of-office ) 4 . pieces per day per possible-delivery 4.53 5.21 4.70 4.78 15.52 4.89 5.28 4.92 5.01 4.30 a see appendix a for source . b reflects the fact that business-routes receive service only 5 days per week . -there are no curb-delivery-routes in business-areas . curb-routes are suitable only for residential-areas . table 1 ( row 2 ) shows that they require less time than either foot or park-and-loop routes . on the other hand , a direct-comparison of rural to city residential-delivery reveals that rural-carrier-time per possible-delivery is only ten percent greater than city residential-route delivery-time . ( seven percent higher if retail-service-costs are eliminated from rural . ) there are at least three major-reasons for rural-route-time per possible-delivery being so close to the corresponding-time for city residential-routes : -rural routes are the functional-equivalent of curbline-city delivery , the most efficient-form of city residential-delivery . curbline-routes , however , account for only 21 percent of city residential possible-deliveries . -rural routes have only 4.3 pieces per possible-delivery , while city residential-routes have 4.8 . thus they incur less in-office costs.13 -as described earlier , rural-customers who do not live along the rural-route must place a mail-receptacle along the rural-route . thus , rural-mail-boxes tend to cluster where roads ( not on the route ) intersect with the carrier 's route . a rural-carrier can serve a cluster of boxes much faster than if the individual-boxes were spread out along the route where the carrier would have to slow down , stop , and accelerate for each one . thus far , we have examined carrier-time per possible-delivery or per box . we now turn to the carrier-time per piece delivered . table 1 ( row 3 ) shows that carrier-time per piece delivered is 12.5 seconds per piece for all city and 12.2 seconds for residential city . this contrasts with 14.9 seconds per piece for rural-routes . thus , on a delivered piece-basis , rural-routes use 20 percent more carrier-time than do all city-routes , and 22 percent more than city residential-routes . the major-explanation for this is fewer average-pieces per possible-delivery per day for rural-routes ( row 4 ) . 13 part of the reason for the difference in pieces per possible-delivery may be due to the fact that five percent of possible residential-deliveries are businesses , and it is thought , but not known , that a lesser percentage of possible-deliveries on rural-routes are businesses . 2.2 . labor-cost the previous-section compared city and rural-delivery on the basis of time . this section estimates postal labor delivery-cost that corresponds to units of time in order to convert time into money in subsequent-sections . the postal-service uses both full-time regular-carriers and casual-employees ( less than full-time or temporary ) on its city and rural-routes . casual-employees are paid lower wages and have fewer fringe-benefits . consequently , their cost to the postal-service is far less than for full-time-employees . full-time rural-carriers ' compensation is slightly lower than full-time-city-carriers . they incur less overtime and the rural-carrier work-force has a higher proportion of casual-employees . as a result , rural-carrier labor-cost to the postal-service in 1989 averaged $ 20.60 per work-hour , or 34.3¢ per minute.14,15 in contrast , in 1989 city-carrier labor-cost the postal-service $ 24.49 per work-hour , or 40.8¢ per minute.16 the difference in labor costs for rural and city-carriers has its roots in the development of the two crafts . in another postal-system there might be no differences in the compensation of city and rural-carriers or it might be much larger . in the united states , rural-wages are generally lower than urban-wages . for purposes of city and rural-delivery-cost analysis , we present ( 1 ) a comparison using the actual-labor-costs of the two crafts , and ( 2 ) a comparison using the average-labor-costs of all postal-service collective-bargaining-employees . this will allow both an actual-cost-analysis and a resource-comparison of city and rural-routes . the average-labor-cost per bargaining-unit-employee in 1989 was $ 24.09 per work-hour or 40.2¢ per minute.17 this is very close to the average city-carrier-cost . 14 highway-contract-carriers have compensation much lower than rural-carriers . because they are not postal-employees , we do not include them in postal-labor-costs . 15 see appendix b for derivation . includes wages , premium-payments ( e.g. , 17 see footnote 15 . 2.3 . delivery-vehicle-cost rural-carriers furnish their own vehicles and provide all maintenance , repairs , and fuel , for which they are paid an allowance.18 in 1989 , rural-carriers received an average of 34 cents per mile as a motor-vehicle-allowance . the average-length of a rural-route is 55 miles . the average annual-cost per rural-route is shown in table 2 . those city-delivery-carriers who make use of a vehicle are furnished with one by the postal-service which also provides all maintenance , repairs , and fuel . city-carriers drive an estimated 15 miles per day . analyzing postal-service accounts for depreciation , fuel , and maintenance for city-delivery-carriers , we have estimated the average-city-delivery vehicle-cost per route.19 this is also shown in table 2 . rural-vehicle-cost per box or possible-delivery is twice the average city-carrier vehicle-cost per possible-delivery . rural-vehicle-cost per delivered piece is two and a half-times-city carrier-cost per delivered piece . it should be borne in mind that , though the `` city '' column divides total-city vehicle-cost by 18 in 1989 , the rural-carrier vehicle allowance was 31 cents per mile or a minimum of $ 12.40 per day , whichever was greater . 19 see appendix c. the total number of city-routes ( including-foot-routes ) , only 84 percent of possible-city-deliveries are made by city-carriers using vehicles . 2.4 . comparison of direct-labor plus vehicle-cost to serve city and rural areas table 3 combines labor-cost with vehicle-cost for city and rural-carriers . it shows that when vehicle-costs are added , the difference in cost per box per day between city and rural-carriers depends heavily on which labor-cost is used . using actual-labor-costs , the city-cost per box per day is 7.5 percent higher . using the average-bargaining labor-cost , city-delivery is 8 percent lower . on a cost-per-piece-basis , city-costs are 8 percent lower using actual-labor-costs and 21 percent lower using the average-bargaining labor costs . 3 . relation of rural-delivery-cost to population-density a priori , population-density should have an important-effect on rural-delivery-cost . we have no data available which directly relate rural-delivery-cost to population-density , but it seems very likely that boxes per mile is highly-correlated with population-density . in order to examine the impact of density on cost , rural-routes have been divided into quintiles based on boxes per mile . table 4 displays the relevant-data . it can be seen that there is wide-variation between the quintiles . in the extreme , the average-number of boxes per route differs by a factor of two . the average-number of miles differs by a factor of 4.5 . average-boxes per mile differ by a factor of nine . moreover , with the exception of daily evaluated time and daily-pieces delivered per box , the average-values of all variables change monotonically . thus , they are correlated with boxes per mile . table 4 distribution of rural-routes by density ( boxes per mile ) selective-averagesa ( 1989 ) a see appendix a for source . the first or least densely-populated quintile stands out from the remaining four . its time per box is half again larger than the mean for all rural-routes and it is nearly two standard-deviations greater than the mean for all rural-routes . the other four quintiles are less than one standard-deviation from the mean . moreover , the first quintile stands apart in that its seconds per piece is also nearly two standard-deviations greater than the mean , while the other four are all less than one standard-deviation from the mean.20 thus , the two measures of cost for the first quintile are substantially greater than for the other four quintiles . this will be seen clearly in section 4 , where the profitability of rural-delivery is calculated for each quintile . it would not be surprising to find that the percentage of boxes which are businesses increases as population-density-increases . if this is true , it could at least partially explain why the number of pieces delivered per box is so much larger for the fourth and fifth quintile than it is for the other three . finally , the variability ( or elasticity ) of time with respect to volume for the five quintiles differs greatly : all 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th-routes .29 .37 .44 .53 .57 .44 thus , for example , if the volume in the first quintile were to double , total-cost would increase by 29 percent . the variation between quintiles can be explained by greater fixed-costs in the less densely-populated quintiles than in the more populated quintiles . the time required to drive the route is fixed , and driving-time represents a greater proportion of total-cost in the less densely-populated quintiles . figure 1 displays the minutes per box per day as a function of density . it can be seen that time per box drops off sharply at the low-end of the density-spectrum and then it flattens . 20 the daily evaluated time per box for all routes ( 1.07 minutes ) has a standard-deviation of 0.30 minutes . the daily evaluated time per piece for all routes ( 14.94 seconds ) has a standard-deviation of 4.64 seconds . 2.400000 2.200000 2.000000 1.800000 1.600000 1.400000 1.200000 1.000000 0.800000 0.600000 0 5 1015202530354045 in order to isolate the effect of density on time per box , the elasticity of time per box with respect to density has been calculated using the route-evaluation-factors ( which are used to determine rural-carrier-pay ) . holding constant the pieces per rural-box and route-miles , a one percent-increase in density reduces out-of-office-time per box by 0.44 percent and total-time per box by 0.27 percent.21 21 the relation between time per box and boxes per mile ( density ) is exponential , or linear in logarithms . the pearson correlation coefficient between the logarithmic-values of the two variables is -78.60 percent . the econometrically estimated constant-elasticity coefficient of a simple log- linear-model with time per box as the dependent-variable and boxes per mile as the explanatory-variable is -27.45 percent with a t-value of -266.22 . 4 . `` profitability '' of serving rural areas22 this section addresses the question : does the united states postal-service find it remunerative to serve rural areas ? a revenue/cost model of rural-delivery has been constructed to determine the profitability23,24 of rural-delivery by quintile . its simple-structure is presented below : model for calculating-profit ( loss ) per box 22 '' profit '' here means contribution to fixed overhead-costs over and above paying the fixed overhead of rural-delivery . 23 the model presented here is valid only for an unsubsidized postal-system such as the postal-service . 24 the simplifying-assumption is made that there is no cost-difference between city and rural-mail with respect to mail-processing , transportation , and retail-service . line 1-the revenue per rural-box per day is calculated by multiplying average postal-service revenue per piece ( from the revenue , pieces and weight report for 1989 ) times the average-number of pieces per box per day ( from table 4 ) . line 2-rural delivery-cost per box per day consists of ( 1 ) labor-cost , ( 2 ) vehicle-cost , and ( 3 ) indirect costs.25 labor-cost per box is obtained by multiplying-labor-cost per minute ( from section 2.1 ) by the average-number of minutes per box ( from table 4 ) . vehicle-cost per box per day are from table 2.26 because there are two labor costs per minute , one actual and the other theoretical , the model is used separately for each labor-cost and provides two annual-profit ( loss ) computations . line 3-here the model takes into account the cost of getting mail to the point of delivery ( e.g. , processing , transportation , administrative , retail , etc. ) . this is done by bifurcating the average attributable cost27 per piece into delivery-attributable cost28 and nondelivery-attributable cost.29 rural-carrier-cost and the nondelivery-attributable cost are then subtracted to arrive at a profit ( loss ) per box per day . observers familiar with postal-rate commission costing procedures will recognize that rural-delivery-cost per box includes the attributable and institutional-costs associated with that function . the commission found in the most recent omnibus-rate-case ( docket r90-1 ) , that 39 percent of rural-delivery-costs are attributable ( i.e. , vary with volume ) and 61 percent are 25 appendix d presents indirect-costs in more detail and shows how they are calculated . 26 dr. john haldi has brought to our attention that the daily-vehicle-cost per box is not the same for all quintiles , as was assumed in an early-version of the paper , but decreases with population-density . the estimated daily-vehicle-cost per box in the revenue/cost model now recognizes the density-differences among the five quintiles : 27 attributable-costs are the postal-costs causally-traceable to mail . they consist predominantly of volume-variable costs . the remaining-costs are called institutional-costs , and they can be treated as fixed . in the united states , the rate commission determines the attributable-cost for each class and subclass of mail . its most recent-analysis is contained in the docket r90-1 opinion and recommended-decision . 28 these are the attributable ( direct and indirect ) costs arising from the delivery-function . we have estimated them for purposes of this analysis . 29 these are total attributable-costs minus delivery-attributable costs . institutional ( i.e. , nonvariable ) .30 because such a large-percentage of the costs are fixed , the profitability-calculation is sensitive to both the average-revenue per piece and the average-pieces per box . if the postal-system operated at a lower scale , revenue per piece would need to be higher to maintain the same revenue-cost balance . it is not clear , without further analysis , what would happen to profitability if the system operated at a lower scale.31 the average-revenue per piece for the entire postal-service is used to estimate the average-revenue per box . we have no independent-estimate of the average-revenue for mail delivered by rural-carriers . if mail delivered by rural-carriers has a different composition compared to the system as a whole , profitability conclusions would vary . in that case , the nondelivery-attributable costs would vary in the same direction as revenue , but not by enough to offset the revenue-change . table 5 provides both the input and output for the profitability calculations for all rural-routes in 1989 . it can be seen that by serving all rural-routes and using actual-labor-costs , the postal-service realized an average-profit of 10.8 cents per box per day , or a total annual-profit for all rural-routes of $ 669 million . to put this figure in perspective , the total accrued-expenditures for the postal-service in 1989 were $ 39 billion.32 table 5 shows that , using the average-labor-cost for all bargaining-employees , the profit drops to $ 283 million . the profit from serving all rural-routes is obviously highly-sensitive to the labor-cost of rural-carriers . however , using either labor-cost figure , rural-delivery was profitable for the postal-service . if , in 1989 , the postal-service 's overall-surplus had been much larger , the profit from rural-delivery would no doubt have been greater . conversely , if the year had been one in which the service had a sizeable-deficit , rural-delivery would have been less profitable . fortunately for purposes of this analysis , the service essentially broke even in 1989 and so the profit from 30 in docket r90-1 , the variability or elasticity of evaluated rural-route-costs with respect to volume was estimated at 44 percent by the postal-service . 31 it does seem clear that the ratio of mail delivered to rural boxes to mail delivered to city-addresses is an important-factor in determining-profitability . 32 the postal-service surplus for 1989 was under $ 100 million . rural-delivery need not be interpreted based on the postal-service 's overall financial results . table 6 displays the profitability of all five quintiles of rural-routes ( based on population-density ) using both actual compensation and average-bargaining-compensation . it can be seen that the profit per box differs substantially from the first ( or least densely-populated ) quintile of rural-routes to the fifth ( or most densely-populated ) quintile . using actual-labor-cost only , the first quintile was unprofitable , while , using average-bargaining labor-cost , the first two quintiles were unprofitable . because the most densely-populated quintiles of routes serve more boxes , their total-profit is disproportionate to their per- box-profit . using either labor-cost , the third , fourth , and fifth quintiles were profitable . given the assumptions discussed above , rural-delivery is remunerative and it is unlikely that it would be abandoned if the universal-service-requirement were eliminated . some observers , however , might expect the postal-service to either drop or reduce the level of service to the boxes in the first or second quintiles of rural-routes . the first quintile comprises only 2.5 percent of all addresses served by rural and city-carriers combined . the second serves 3.9 percent . 5 . concluding-remarks and summary 5.1 . concluding-remarks while the boxes served by the quintile of routes serving the least densely-populated areas are unprofitable , we believe that it is unlikely that the postal-service would discontinue service to them ( or try to decrease their level of service ) if the universal-service-requirement were eliminated . -the total-loss on those boxes is small-relative to total-costs of the postal-service . -because these routes are scattered all over the country , boxes on these routes are not easily-identifiable without consulting an extensive-list . consequently , it would be costly for firms to separate-mail addressed to these boxes from their remaining-mail . -the transaction-costs involved in putting-pieces addressed to boxes in the first quintile of rural-routes in the hands of another delivery-firm , which would serve these addresses , would also be high . -if these addresses were dropped from the delivery-network , it would likely reduce the volume of mail sent by these addresses to the remaining-portions of the delivery-network . thus , profitable volume would be lost . perhaps the above four points are simply underlying-reasons for the truism that for common-carriers serving the general-population , larger service-networks ( be they mail , package , overnight , or telephone ) are more valuable to customers and providers than smaller service-networks . it is no accident that , within the united states , united parcel-service provides ubiquitous-service for parcels.33 federal express and other overnight-carriers do the same for overnight-delivery . moreover , the major long distance-telephone carriers also provide ubiquitous-service . quite possibly , all of these common-carriers find that sparsely settled-portions of the country are unprofitable to serve . that these organizations provide universal-service suggests that rural areas would receive postal-service even absent a universal-service-requirement . 5.2 . summary -in the united states postal-system , there is no real-difference in the carrier-time required to serve city and rural-addresses . -the average-city-delivery cost reflects the higher cost of serving-businesses compared to residences . -rural delivery-cost reflects a lower level of service than city-delivery . 33 ups does not provide parcel-service at the ordinary-rate to the alaska bush where there are no roads and service must be provided by air . -because fewer pieces are delivered per box on rural-routes than per possible-delivery on city-routes , the per piece-delivery-cost is higher for rural-routes than for city-routes . -the cost of delivery per box for the least densely-populated quintile of rural-routes is much higher than the average for all rural-routes . -the revenue from mail delivered to rural areas as a whole exceeds the cost of handling and delivering that mail . -there is a loss on serving the least densely-populated quintile of rural-routes . -it is likely that if the universal-service-requirement were eliminated , even the most sparsely-populated rural areas would receive service . appendix a . major data-sources a.1 . city-delivery-carrier data the 1989 city-delivery-carrier data used in this paper are based on information from several postal-service data-systems . total-city delivery carrier work hoursa come from payroll-hours-accounting systems-data made available in the most recent-rate-proceeding . these work-hours are apportioned among city-delivery-carrier route-types on the basis of cost-allocations from the in-office-cost system , b an ongoing-work sampling system that is used to allocate costs for certain-labor-crafts among different-activities and rate categories for ratemaking-purposes . information concerning the total number of possible-deliveries is taken from the 1989 city-delivery national totals report . carrier-cost system ( ccs ) data are used to allocate total possible-deliveries among different-route-types and to determine the average-pieces per possible-delivery for different-delivery and route-types on letter-routes . the ccs is used in rate-cases to determine attributable-costs and associated distribution-keys for certain city-carrier-activities . ccs data are collected throughout the year from over 500 thousand sampled stops on city-delivery-letter routes . a.2 . rural-delivery carrier data most rural-routes are evaluated routes . evaluated routes are those routes for which the rural-carrier 's annual-salary is calculated using a set of standard-time-allowances . time-standards are applied to workload-elements ( e.g. , mileage , delivery-boxes , quantity of mail by shape , etc . ) to calculate the total evaluated time required to serve a rural-route , and thus the salary of the carrier serving that route . to measure the workload-elements needed to calculate the evaluated time , a national mail count for most rural-routes is conducted periodically in accordance with the labor-agreement between the united states postal-service and the union of rural-carriers . the statistics on rural-routes presented in this paper are based on the 1989 national mail count data.c a docket r90-1 , usps-lr-f-342 . b docket r90-1 , usps-t-13 , w/s 7.0.7 , p. 1. c the postal-service used a sample of the 1989 national mail count data to measure the elasticity ( variability ) of rural-carrier-costs with respect to mail-volume . docket r90-1 , usps-t-13 , appendix f. the 1989 national mail count was conducted for 24-delivery-days from september 5 to october 2 , 1989 , and included 44,775 rural-routes out of a total of 46,197 . data for a
