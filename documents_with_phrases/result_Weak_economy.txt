the baltimore sun weak-economy , court-challenge threaten legal services' funding advocates turning to state for financial-assistance andrea f. siegel saturday , january 11 , 2003 the main-funding-source for maryland 's legal-services to the poor has fallen on hard-times , and advocates are preparing to seek unprecedented-state financial-help - even as they keep an eye on a legal-challenge that threatens to cut off a main-source of funding for such services nationwide . the maryland legal-services corp. - which supports 28 organizations providing legal-help to those with cases involving domestic-abuse , landlord-tenant-disputes and other issues - faces a $ 1 million-budget-shortfall because of slack-interest on the accounts that help fund it . the state 's chief-judge is seeking a $ 1.2 million subsidy to close the gap in the organization 's $ 7 million annual-budget , and advocates are planning a strong-push in the general assembly . `` you can bet we will be doing every kind of lobbying we can do for our funding , '' said wilhelm h. joseph jr. , executive director of the maryland legal-aid bureau , the largest provider of legal-help to the poor . the bureau receives $ 3.4 million of its $ 15 million budget from the maryland legal-services corp. , which was established by the general assembly in 1982 . chief-judge robert m. bell said his budget-request is intended '' to maintain the same level of services that we have had in the last-several years in terms of access to justice '' for the needy . the timing is awful , advocates concede , as the state-legislature weighs what to do about an expected $ 1.2 billion-state-budget shortfall . complicating the picture is a case pending before the u.s. supreme court from washington state that challenges the mechanism every state uses as a mainstay of legalservices-funding . at issue is an arrangement that skims-interest from short-term trust-accounts that lawyers hold on behalf of their clients and funnels it to legal-services groups . by law , the interest must be too small to be worthwhile for banks to process for individual-account-holders . iolta challenged until interest rates plummeted , this mechanism ( known as iolta , or interest on lawyer trust-accounts ) pumped up to $ 4 million a year into maryland legal-services and about $ 160 million into such services nationwide . but last month , the high court heard a constitutional-challenge claiming that the government takes the interest without just compensation to clients . a ruling is expected by june . even if the funding-mechanism is upheld , legal-services groups will be hard-pressed to meet their needs because of low-interest-rates , according to the american bar-association . in the fiscal year that ended in june , iolta revenue in maryland was $ 3.8 million - down from $ 4.2 million two years ago and $ 5.2 million in the heyday of high interest rates . that led to cuts this year of up to 20 percent to 18-legal-services-groups , despite emergency-infusions of cash . `` under the best-case-scenario - if iolta is upheld - we are projecting a $ 1.2 million shortfall , '' said robert j. rhudy , executive director of the mlsc . `` the critical need for legal-aid has gone up because of the recession . '' he said that without more state-help , the mlsc will cut grants by up to 25 percent next year . that would force groups to drop some advocacy-work and thus serve fewer people . as it is , advocates say the 110,000 marylanders they reach probably are no more than 20 percent of those in need . the $ 65,000 going to the women 's law center , for example , funds two days a week of a statewide hot-line , counseling 2,600 needy women last year -so many that callers say it can be hard to get through . callers include those who have been abandoned without access to family-money , those not receiving court-ordered-child-support and those who want to leave their husbands but are unsure about their legal-rights . in the event of a funding-cut , `` there is no way we would be able to pick it up , '' said l. tracy brown , executive director of the center . j. peter sabonis jr. , executive director of the homeless persons representation project in baltimore , which took a 10-percent-cut last year , will reduce outreach if more funds disappear . `` that means , for us , we wo n't have a presence out in front of a welfare-office , we wo n't be out there on the day-laborers ' line at 4:30 in the morning , we wo n't have a lawyer at a soup-kitchen , '' sabonis said . shelly norman , 30 , got her legal-aid from sabonis ' group . after a drug-conviction kept her out of subsidized-housing , the group intervened and got her housing - along with a court-hearing that changed her conviction to a misdemeanor with probation before judgment . she is about to return to court for a hearing to clear her record . meantime , she has graduated from coppin state college , works as a drug and alcohol-counselor , left subsidized-housing and plans to start work on a master 's degree this year . `` they 've helped me so much , my life has truly turned around , '' she said . other programs focus on battered-women and children , the disabled , day-laborers , community-improvement-groups and crime-victims . lobbying-campaign to help ensure that such services continue , the maryland state-bar-association and other advocates are lobbying-legislators to explain how legal-services help constituents in every district . for the first time , and at the judiciary 's request , rhudy has sent every new legislator an orientation-package about legal-help for the poor . though optimistic , advocates know that getting $ 1.2 million from the state is an uphill-fight . `` everyone else ... is looking for more funding in a year when there is a $ 1 billion shortfall , '' said house speaker michael e. busch , an anne arundel county democrat . `` everybody has taken a big-hit , '' said senate president thomas v. mike miller , a prince george 's county democrat . `` i do believe the legislators will look askance at new issues . '' a spokesman for gov.-elect robert l. ehrlich jr. said the incoming-administration could make no funding promises . advocates are looking at other ways to generate money . a letter-writing-campaign asks every lawyer in maryland to donate `` at least the dollar-value of one billable-hour '' - typically a couple of hundred dollars - to the legal-aid bureau . check , in lieu of work starting next month , lawyers must report to the courts how much free or low-fee legal-work they do for the poor and charities , with a goal of 50 hours a year . though many lawyers provide such services , they are also being urged to write a check to a legal-services-organization in lieu of the hours . advocates also might borrow ideas from other states . tennessee has a surcharge on speeding-tickets , ohio assesses an annual-lawyer registration-fee , and texas uses dollars from its crime-victims compensation-fund for such programs . maryland has a surcharge on court-filing-fees that goes to legal-services for the needy .
