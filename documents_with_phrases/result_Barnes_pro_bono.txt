barnes to work pro-bono pro duane d. stanford wednesday , december 18 , 2002 steven gottlieb thought it was a joke when he checked his voicemail and heard gov . roy barnes saying he wanted to come to work for the atlanta legal-aid society . `` how would you like to have a lawyer for six months ? '' barnes asked the executive director . at least , it sounded like barnes . gottlieb , who was vacationing in new zealand , asked his secretary to check it out . she confirmed the unbelievable -- - it was barnes , and the offer was legit . `` i 've never heard of a former-governor going to work for a legal-aid-program , '' said gottlieb . `` i take that as an incredible compliment . '' two days after the news leaked out , barnes confirmed tuesday he will go to work for the nonprofit-group for six months , donating his time to handle cases on behalf of lowincome-georgians . barnes , speaking at a press conference attended by gottlieb , said his first priority has always been to look out for georgians ' interests . `` holding elective-office is not the only way to help others , '' said barnes , an attorney who helped found a high-profile-law-firm in marietta before winning the governor 's race in 1998 . the move could also help barnes clean up the `` king roy '' image that dogged him during his re-election-campaign and contributed to his surprise-loss to sonny perdue on nov. 5 . asked about his legacy tuesday , barnes was cautious : `` i 'm not a big one on legacy ; that's up to others to determine . '' political consultant rick dent said it is unlikely that barnes is attempting to remake his image , especially since it could be construed as a negative by those who believe barnes is liberal . `` i think it 's refreshing to see someone leave public-office and not cash in , and do something he really does care about , '' said dent , who served as spokesman for democratic gov . zell miller in the 1990s . legal-aid 's volunteer-lawyers work on behalf of low-income-clients who often do n't have access to the legal-system . the group 's lawyers handle only civil-cases . barnes first got to know the organization while working to protect borrowers from socalled `` predatory-lenders .
