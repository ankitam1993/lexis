office of the general counsel b-277149 june 12 , 1997 the honorable richard g. lugar chairman the honorable tom harkin ranking minority member committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry united states senate the honorable bob smith chairman the honorable charles w. stenholm ranking minority member committee on agriculture house of representatives subject : department of agriculture , commodity credit corporation : environmental-quality incentives program pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the department of agriculture , commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) , entitled '' environmental-quality incentives program '' ( rin : 0578-aa19 ) . we received the rule on may 29 , 1997 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on may 22 , 1997 . 62 fed . reg . 28258 . although this rule was promulgated by the commodity credit corporation ( the organization that funds the environmental-quality incentives program ) , it was filed with us by the natural-resources conservation service ( the organization whose personnel administer the program ) . the environmental-quality incentives program ( eqip ) is a new conservation-program , reflecting the functions of four previous programs -- the agricultural conservation-program , the great plains conservation-program , the water-quality incentives program , and the colorado river basin salinity control program . those programs were repealed as of april 4 , 1996 . however , an interim-program was instituted between april 4 and october 4 , 1996 , to maintain a basic program until eqip could begin . 16 u.s.c . § 3839aa-8 . gao/ogc-97-50 according to the natural-resources conservation service , this single , voluntary-program will provide flexible technical , financial , and educational-assistance to farmers and ranchers who face serious-threats to soil , water , and related natural-resources on agricultural and other lands , including-grazing-lands , wetlands , forest-lands , and wildlife-habitats . enclosed is our assessment of the ccc 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that , except for ignoring the 60-day delay in the effective-date of a major-rule required by the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996 ( sbrefa ) , the ccc complied with the applicable-requirements . the preamble to the final-rule-states that the rule is effective on the date of publication in the federal register , may 22 , 1997 , because ccc has determined that it is impracticable , unnecessary , and contrary to the public-interest to delay the effective-date of the rule . the immediate effective-date , according to the preamble , will permit the ccc to offer the public timely , reliable-information about funding for conservation-practices as early as possible before the start of the spring 1997-planting-season because it may influence planting-decisions . failure to provide the information in a timely manner may mean another year-delay in the conservation-benefits . finally , it stated that the expiration on april 4 , 1996 , of the four former-conservation-programs and the end of the 180-day authority to administer an interim-conservation program on october 4 , 1996 , mean there is no program to provide technical , financial , and educational-assistance to farmers and ranchers . sbrefa provides that where an agency for `` good-cause '' finds that notice and public-procedures are impracticable , unnecessary , or contrary to the public-interest , the delay-provisions of section 801 do not apply . 5 u.s.c . § 808 ( 2 ) . here , ccc did not make such a finding but published the proposed-rule on october 11 , 1996 , in accordance with the administrative procedure act . it received and considered comments on the proposed-rule . as discussed in our report on a major-rule issued by the health care financing administration concerning medicare ( b-275549 , b-275552 , december 9 , 1996 ) , the `` good-cause '' exception to the 60-day delay provision found at section 808 ( 2 ) is not available when notice and comment procedures have been used . moreover , we note that an effective-date of may 22 , 1997 , is in all probability too late to influence spring planting-decisions . also , the fact that the four former-programs expired over a year ago and the temporary-authority expired 8 months previously seems to make a further delay of 60 days of small-consequence . page 2 gao/ogc-97-50 if you have any questions about this report , please contact kathleen wannisky , associate general counsel for operations ,

agriculture page 3 gao/ogc-97-50 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the department of agriculture , commodity credit corporation entitled `` environmental-quality incentives program '' ( rin : 0578-aa19 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis because the office of management and budget ( omb ) determined that this was an `` economically-significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order 12866 , the natural-resources conservation service ( nrcs ) conducted an economic-analysis of the potential-impacts associated with this program . nrcs submitted that analysis to the general-accounting-office on may 29 , 1997 , along with a copy of its final-rule . the analysis-estimates that the environmental-quality incentives program ( eqip ) will have a beneficial-impact on the adoption of conservation-practices and , when installed or applied to technical-standards , will increase net-farm-income . the analysis also estimates that society will benefit from the program in terms of longterm-productivity , maintenance of the resource-base , non-point source pollution damage reductions , and wildlife-enhancements . nrcs states that , because eqip is a voluntary-program , it will not impose any obligations or burdens on agricultural-producers who choose not to participate . nrcs states that the program was authorized at $ 1.3 billion for the period fy 1996 through fy 2002 , with annual-amounts of $ 200 million after the initial interim-year of $ 130 million . in the analysis the agency discusses the three alternatives considered in implementing the program -- i.e. , targeting all the funds to priority-areas , targeting the majority of the funds to priority-areas , and targeting the majority of the funds to non-priority-areas . the analysis discusses the beneficial-effects and the adverse-effects of each alternative and concludes that the second alternative offered the greatest environmental-return for the federal-dollars spent , provided program-managers and participants the greatest flexibility in program-administration , gave effective-conservation-coverage across the land , and involved a large number of participants . gao/ogc-97-50 ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 the preamble to the final-rule ( 62 fed . reg . 28258 ) states that the regulatory-flexibility-act is not applicable to this rule because the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) , which funds this program and has issued this rule , is not required by 5 u.s.c . § 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed-rulemaking with respect to the subject-matter of this rule . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 according to the preamble , the rule does not compel the expenditure of $ 100 million or more by any state , local , or tribal-government or the private sector and , therefore , a statement under section 202 of the unfunded-mandates act of 1995 is not required . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . according to ccc , this rule is not covered by section 553 of the administrative procedure act because ccc is not required to publish a notice of proposed-rulemaking by that section or any other provision of law . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 ccc states that no substantive-changes have been made in this final-rule which affect the recordkeeping-requirements and estimated-burdens previously reviewed and approved under omb control-number 0560-0174 . executive-order l2866 omb determined that this rule was an economically-significant regulatory-action under executive-order 12866 because it could result in an annual-effect on the economy of $ 100 million or more . pursuant to the order , nrcs conducted an economic-analysis , as discussed above . the nrcs economic-analysis is discussed in the preamble to the final-rule ( 62 fed . reg . 28258 ) ; nrcs provided a full-copy of the analysis to us when it filed its copy of the final-rule on may 29 , 1997 . executive-order 12998 the agency reviewed this rule under executive-order 12998 , civil-justice-reform , and determined that the provisions of the final-rule are not retroactive and that they page 2 gao/ogc-97-50 preempt-state and local-laws to the extent such laws are inconsistent with this rule . before any legal action is brought against this rule in federal court , the administrative-appeal rights set forth at 7 c.f.r . parts 11 and 614 must be exhausted . federal crop-insurance reform and department of agriculture reorganization-act of 1994 ( pub . l. no . 103-354 ) the department of agriculture classified this rule as a major-rule pursuant to section 304 of the federal crop-insurance reform and department of agriculture reorganization-act of 1994 since it had an annual economic-impact on the economy of at least $ 100 million and it also affected human-health and safety or the environment . because of this classification , nrcs staff , in cooperation with agriculture 's office of risk-assessment and cost-benefit-analysis , prepared an environmental-risk-assessment for eqip . the major-conclusion of this assessment is that agricultural-production activities , in the absence of conservation-techniques and practices , can have serious environmental-impacts . the assessment concluded that the best solutions to address risks to environmentally stressed-resources are conservation-measures applied in concerted , concentrated-efforts in priority-areas , with smaller scale-efforts going to sectors outside priority-areas . national environmental policy act of 1969 , 42 u.s.c . §§ 4321 et seq . in compliance with the national environmental policy act of 1969 , as amended , nrcs staff developed an environmental-assessment of this rule to determine if implementation would have a significant impact on the human-environment . nrcs concluded that it would not and the chief of nrcs issued a finding of no significant impact on may 20 , 1997 . nrcs provided us with a complete-copy of the environmental-assessment and the finding of no significant impact . statutory-authorization for the rule ccc cites as authority for this rule 15 u.s.c . §§ 714b and 714c ; 16 u.s.c . §§ 3839aa-3839aa-8 . page 3 gao/ogc-97-50
