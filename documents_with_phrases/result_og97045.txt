office of the general counsel b-277027 june 20 , 1997 the honorable john h. chafee chairman the honorable max baucus ranking minority member committee on environment and public works united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : environmental-protection agency : new motor-vehicles and new motor-vehicle engines air-pollution-control : voluntary standards for light-duty-vehicles ; final-rule pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the environmental-protection agency ( epa ) , entitled `` new motor-vehicles and new motor-vehicle engines air-pollution-control : voluntary standards for light-duty-vehicles ; final-rule '' ( rin : 2060-af75 ) . we received the rule on may 14 , 1997 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on june 6 , 1997 . 62 fed . reg . 31192 . the rule provides the main regulatory-framework for the national low-emission vehicle-program and creates the means whereby automobile and light-duty-truck-manufacturers can volunteer to comply with tailpipe-standards that are more strict than epa can mandate at this time . the rule is the result of the ozone-transport commission ( otc ) recommendation that epa mandate a low-emission vehicle-program based on the california program . the otc consists of the governor ( or gao/ogc-97-45 designee ) of each state in the ozone-transport region ( otr ) ,1 the epa administrator ( or designee ) , the regional epa administrator ( or designee ) , and an air-pollution-control official representing each state . without a national-program , each of the otc states would adopt a state-by-state-program , mostly based on the california program , unless a state could show it could meet the clean-air act requirements by some other means . the remaining 37 states would be subject to the requirements of the current clean-air act standards at least until model-year 2004 . according to epa , these regulations and other actions taken by epa substantially harmonize federal and california motor-vehicle standards , and once a manufacturer opts into the program , enforcement would be the same as any other federal-motor-vehicle pollution-control-program . the quid pro quo for manufacturers opting into the program and subjecting themselves to the mandates of the regulation is regulatory-stability and the need to meet only one set of nationwide-standards to which vehicles can be designed , manufactured , and tested . although the rule is made effective on august 5 , 1997 , because it is voluntary it can not be implemented until the otc and the manufacturers reach final-agreement on certain remaining-issues . enclosed is our assessment of the epa 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the epa complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact alan zuckerman , assistant general counsel , at ( 202 ) 512-4586 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the environmental-protection agency is peter guerrero , director , environmental-protection issues . mr. guerrero can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-6111 . sincerely yours , robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : thomas e. kelly director , office of regulatory management and information environmental-protection agency 1the otr is made up of northeastern-states : maine , vermont , new hampshire , massachusetts , rhode island , connecticut , new york , new jersey , pennsylvania , delaware , maryland , the northern-portion of virginia , and the district of columbia . page 2 gao/ogc-97-45 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the environmental-protection agency entitled `` new motor-vehicles and new motor-vehicle engines air-pollution-control : voluntary standards for light-duty-vehicles ; final-rule '' ( rin : 2060-af75 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the epa included an analysis of the costs and benefits of a national low-emission vehicle-program with its submission to this office . that analysis shows an annual estimated-cost ( vehicle-price increases ) of the national-program for states other than california of $ 950 million , as opposed to the $ 350 million annual-cost for the otc program alone . although the national-program and the otc program would appear to achieve the same pollution-reduction in the otr , it would do so at a lower per-vehicle cost ( $ 76 per-vehicle ) based on national-sales-volumes as opposed to the $ 84 per-vehicle cost for the sales-volumes in the otr . because the epa has no authority to change the current clean-air act standards before model-year 2004 , implementation of the voluntary-program will result in substantially reduced exhaust-pollutants nationwide earlier than could otherwise be achieved because of the more stringent-standards of this rule . the benefits of these reductions do not appear to have been monetized in the analysis . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 epa has concluded that it was not necessary to prepare a regulatory-flexibility-analysis because the rule only affects motor-vehicle manufacturers , a group that is not comprised of a substantial-number of small businesses . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 although the rule qualifies as a covered rule within the meaning of the unfunded-mandates reform act ( act ) , it appears not to qualify as either a federal intergovernmental-mandate or a federal private-sector-mandate because it results in `` a duty arising from participation in a voluntary federal-program '' ( section 421 ( 5 ) ( a ) ( i ) ( ii ) and ( 7 ) ( a ) ( ii ) of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 as added by pub . l. 104-4 § 101 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( 1995 ) ) . gao/ogc-97-45 as a consequence , epa did not prepare the statements required by the act . epa did , however , prepare a regulatory-impact-analysis which it furnished to this office . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule was promulgated using the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . a notice of proposed-rulemaking was published on october 10 , 1995 , 60 fed . reg . 52734 , and comments were requested . the preamble-states that numerous-comments were received and a widely attended public-hearing was held on november 1 , 1995 . epa avers that it fully considered all of the timely received public-comments and its responses to significant-comments are either contained in the preamble or included in the public-docket . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule contains information-collection-requirements which are subject to the paperwork reduction act . epa submitted the information-collection-request to omb , which has not yet approved it . statutory-authorization for the rule the agency cites the clean-air act , 42 u.s.c . §§ 7521-7525 , 7541 , 7542 , and 7601 . executive-order no . 12866 the epa submitted the rule to omb for review under executive-order 12866 as a `` significant regulatory-action . '' the agency reports that any changes made in response to omb suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public-record . page 2 gao/ogc-97-45
