office of the general counsel b-272425.1 july 16 , 1996 the honorable john h. chafee chairman the honorable max baucus ranking minority member committee on environment and public works united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : regulation of fuels and fuel-additives : certification-standards for deposit control gasoline-additives pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the environmental-protection agency , entitled `` regulation of fuels and fuel-additives : certification-standards for deposit control gasoline-additives '' ( rin : 2060-ag06 ; frl # 5528-5 ) . we received the rule on june 28 , 1996 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on july 5 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 35309 . this rule establishes a certification-program for detergent-additives used to control the formation of deposits in gasoline engines . this certification-program requires the use of detergents in most gasolines used in the united states as mandated by the clean-air act amendments of 1990 and replaces an interim-program which began on january 1 , 1995 . the final-rule contains standardized-test-procedures and performance-standards to ensure that detergent gasolines provide an effective-level of protection against certain-engine-deposits . enclosed is our assessment of the environmental-protection agency 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by sections 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 gao/ogc-96-27 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the environmental-protection agency complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact james vickers , senior-attorney , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the environmental-protection agency is peter guerrero , director , environmental-protection issues . mr. guerrero can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-6111 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : thomas e. kelly , director office of regulatory management and information environmental-protection agency page 2 gao/ogc-96-27 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the environmental-protection agency entitled `` regulation of fuels and fuel-additives : certification-standards for deposit control gasoline-additives '' ( rin : 2060-ag06 ; frl # 5528-5 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis as discussed below , the environmental-protection agency ( epa ) determined that this final-rule was a `` significant regulatory-action '' based on an annual economic-impact of $ 100 million or more under executive-order 12866 and submitted to the office of management and budget the required regulatory-impact-analysis which contains an analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule . the total-producer-costs estimated by epa including the costs of certification , addization of the detergents , recordkeeping and enforcement through the year 2000 is almost $ 704 million . the cost to the average-consumer , if all the cost of the detergent is passed along to the consumer anew , even by those producers who already sell fully additized-gasoline , would be $ 6.00 per year . the benefits to be gained in air-quality were calculated by epa for the first six years ( including the interim-program ) to be reductions of 125,000 tons of hydrocarbons , 2,388,000 tons of carbon-monoxide and 450,000 tons of nitrogen-oxide . increased fuel-economy achieved by a reduction of engine-deposits is estimated to be over $ 295 million for the same time period . while epa anticipates there will also be vehicle-maintenance-benefits , sufficient-data was not available to quantify the benefits . this analysis was revised when it was determined that the interim-program , which began on january 1 , 1995 , would last 30 months rather than 18 months and there were changes in the estimated-cost of deposit-control-testing and the addition , in the final-rule , of a required deposit demonstration test to qualify test-fuels for certification-testing-purposes . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 the impact of this rule on small-entities was considered in a regulatory-flexibility-analysis under section 603 that was summarized in the preamble of the interim-program ( 59 fed . reg . 54705 ) and the entire-analysis , which was included in the regulatory-impact-analysis , was available for review in epa's public-docket . the gao/ogc-96-27 preamble to the final-rule addresses changes made to the regulatory-impact-analysis , as discussed under the cost-benefit-analysis section above , and the impact on small-entities . following this analysis , epa has concluded and certified that the rule will not have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . the analysis states that the industry affected by the rule includes numerous-business-entities in the chain of gasoline-production and the business-size considered to be a small-entity varies from 100 to 1500 employees under the sic codes and size-standards of the small business-administration . therefore , the impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution . however , the overall-impact is expected to be modest , even for those industries most heavily impacted , and for small additive and additive injection equipment-manufacturers , the rule could result in additional economic-opportunities through increased sales . the analysis also discusses alternative-approaches which were considered by epa but were found lacking because they did not either significantly reduce the burden on small-entities or would have jeopardized the program 's projected air-quality-benefits . according to an official at epa , publication of the certifications in the federal register in connection with the interim-program and the final-rule was treated as providing-notice under section 605 ( b ) to the small business-administration 's ( sba ) chief-counsel for advocacy . the sba has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice without objection from the sba . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 according to the epa , the final-rule will not impose any federal-mandates , as defined in title ii of the act , on state , local or tribal-governments nor any enforceable-duties on those governmental-entities . therefore , sections 203 and 204 of the act are not applicable . however , the rule does contain federal-mandates that will result in the expenditure of $ 100 million or more in any one year for the private sector . the epa , in the preamble to the final-rule , states that the certification-program represents the least costly , most cost-effective-approach to achieving the air-quality-goals by relying on the cost-benefit-analysis performed in connection with executive-order no . 12866 , as permitted by section 202 ( b ) and ( c ) of the act . 61 fed . reg . 35355 . page 2 gao/ogc-96-27 ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule complied with the notice and comment-rulemaking procedures of the act , 5 u.s.c . § 553 . this is the fourth rulemaking-action which epa has undertaken to implement the requirement contained in section 211 ( l ) of the clean-air act amendments of 1990 . on december 6 , 1993 , a notice of proposed-rulemaking was published . 58 fed . reg . 64213 . subsequently , on october 14 , 1994 , the rule for the interim detergent-program was published . 59 fed . reg . 54678 . in order to obtain more comments regarding the possible requirement for control of combustion-chamber-deposits in the final-rule and to seek more public-input in other areas involving the certification-testing and various-implementation and enforcement-provisions , a notice of reopening of the comment-period was published on december 28 , 1994 . the epa received 80 written comments and six oral-presentations were made at a public-hearing held by epa . the epa 's response to the comments received are summarized in the preamble to the final-rule and a detailed-presentation and evaluation of the comments received are contained in a separate `` summary and analysis of comments . '' epa docket item v-b-02 . comments regarding-enforcement issues and questions raised by the regulated industry were addressed by epa in four `` detergent rule-question and answer documents . '' epa docket nos . iv-c-08 , iv-c-09 , iv-c-10 , iv-c-11 . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule contains information-collection-requirements which will allow epa to determine that detergent-additives which are effective in controlling-deposits are used and that emission-control-goals are realized . the information to be submitted is of various-types and complexities depending upon the role of the submitter ( additive manufacturers , refiners , terminals , truckers or retailers ) in the manufacturing and distribution-process . the preamble to the final-rule-sets forth the reasons for collecting the information and the burden-estimates for the various-parties . the epa has certified under section 3506 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the act and submitted the information-collection-requirement to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for approval as required by the paperwork reduction act and has solicited-comments regarding the proposed collection-requirements to be submitted to both epa and omb . the collection-requirement will not be effective until omb-approval is obtained . therefore , the information-collection-requirements contained in the page 3 gao/ogc-96-27 interim-program ( already approved by omb ) will continue to be effective until replaced by the requirements contained in the final-rule . statutory-authorization for the rule section 211 ( l ) of the clean-air act amendments of 1990 ( pub . l. 101-549 ) provided that the administrator of epa shall promulgate a rule establishing-specifications for detergent-additives to implement the requirement , also contained in section 211 ( l ) , that , effective january 1 , 1995 , no gasoline may be sold or dispensed which does not contain additives to prevent the accumulation of deposits in engines or fuel-systems . executive-order no . 12866 based on its economic-impact , the rule was determined to be a '' significant regulatory-action '' within the meaning of executive-order no . 12866 . consistent with the executive-order , the rule was initiated through an advance-notice of proposed-rulemaking and a regulatory-impact-analysis was included in the interim-program notice in the federal register . the analysis was forwarded to the office of management and budget , office of information and regulatory affairs ( oira ) for its consideration and comments as contemplated by the order . oira suggested no changes in the rule but oira had epa supply more elaboration in the preamble to the final-rule concerning the deposit control test standards and the retention of a 5 percent flow loss performance-standard rather than the industry supported 10 percent flow loss . epa did not identify any other statutes or executive-orders imposing-requirements relevant to the rule . page 4 gao/ogc-96-27
