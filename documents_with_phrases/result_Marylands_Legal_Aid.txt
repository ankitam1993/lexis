maryland 's legal-aid bureau : a national-leader . saturday , january 4 , 2003 when it comes to nationally ranked institutions in maryland , several come to mind : the terps , the johns hopkins university and the baltimore symphony , just to name a few . here 's another one to add to the list co the legal-aid bureau , founded in 1911 and today recognized nationally for its leadership in providing civil legal-services to the poor . `` in terms of delivery of service , innovation , and diversity in leadership , the legal-aid bureau is in the forefront of programs around the country that promote access to justice , '' said martha bergmark , senior-vice-president for projects at the national legal-aid and defender association in washington , d.c. '' maryland has a lot to trumpet , '' bergmark added . `` the legal-aid bureau has become a lead-player in the justice-community by building-partnerships with other organizations , the courts and the mediacoall critical-components to make justice available to all in maryland . '' john a. tull , a private-consultant in colorado who has worked with legal-services-organizations for more than 30 years and is a former-vice-president of the national legal-services corp. , said legal-aid `` really stands out for its remarkable-sense of commitment to make a difference in the lives of its clients . '' that 's particularly-noteworthy because of the tenor of the times for legal-services , tull added , noting that funding-concerns and congressional-restrictions could dampen zealous and creative advocacy . for academic-recognition , you do n't have to go far . `` legal-aid now offers some of the most creative-services for legal-aid found across the country , '' said michael a. millemann , a law-professor at the university of maryland and a former-deputy director of the multnomah county , ore. , legal-aid service . `` it has state-of-the-art-intake and has recruited some excellent-lawyers to its staff . '' a private , nonprofit-law-firm with 13 offices around maryland , the legal-aid bureau boasts a $ 15 million annual-budget , nearly 300 employees ( more than 140 are lawyers ) and handles more than 50,000 cases a year . the bureau , headquartered in baltimore , is the cornerstone of civil legal-services in the state . the person responsible for propelling the bureau into the front rank of legal-service-providers nationally was executive director charles h. dorsey jr. , who led the organization from 1974 until his death in 1995 . under dorsey co who grew up in segregated baltimore , was the first black-graduate of loyola college and the first black-attorney to serve on the state board of law-examiners co the bureau expanded into a statewide-law-firm that reached out to the rural as well as urban poor . dorsey was also a driving-force behind legal-aid 's downtown baltimore headquarters , the first in the u.s. specifically designed and built to house a legal-services-operation . building on the foundation established by dorsey is wilhelm h. joseph jr. , who became executive director in 1996 . millemann , who worked at legal-aid for three years beginning in the late-1960s , said joseph `` has exceeded my expectations of what's possible by 500 percent . he 's attracted good-people , generated enthusiasm , and gained the respect of the bar and the law-schools . '' one indication of that success is funding . to raise money from the private-bar , joseph created the equal-justice council , spearheaded today by retired piper rudnick managing partner decatur h. miller . the result ? since 1996 legal-aid has increased its annual revenue by $ 6 million , renovated all of its offices and increased staff-salaries co which helps explain why 7 out of 13 chief ( or managing ) attorneys around the state are former legal-aid-lawyers who returned after stints in private or government-practice . the beneficiaries of the improvements are legal-aid 's clients , who include residents of subsidized and public-housing , the elderly , migrant-farm-workers , and neglected and abused-children . examples of this bread-and-butter-work include highly-contentious custody-disputes , cases involving sub-standard-housing and loss of shelter , and the loss of disability and other health-benefits , to name a few . the bureau 's major-objectives are to increase economic-stability of its clients , preserve affordable-housing , and stabilize families and communities . yet the bureau 's efforts go beyond helping individual-clients . those objectives include making-changes in systems that affect the poor . for example , one ongoing-project ( funded by the abell foundation ) works to decrease employment-barriers to 45,000 non-custodial-fathers in baltimore whose child-support-obligations ( especially-money owed to the state ) exceed their ability to pay . `` current child-support policies are driving many of them out of the above-ground-economy , '' said hannah e. m. lieberman , the bureau 's director of advocacy . `` without change , we 're consigning another generation to entrenched-poverty . '' another example : housing preservation . under a three-year , $ 450,000 grant from the u.s. department of housing and urban development , legal-aid is helping-thousands of low-income-marylanders living in properties where federal-subsidies are about to run out . in annapolis , the bureau 's 20-year representation of the bloomsbury public-housing-project resulted in a victory that will result in the relocation of residents co many of them elderly and disabled co to new waterfront-housing that will keep the last black neighborhood in the city intact . `` instead of moving to a remote-area far from jobs , shopping , schools and public-transportation , the residents will move a block to new housing that will conform to historic-area building standards on a former-parking-lot on college creek , '' said janet labella , chief-attorney of the bureau 's anne arundel county-office . while legal-aid 's efforts historically have been aimed at helping the poorest of the poor co because of funding-limitations , only about 20 percent of eligible potential-clients are served co some recent technological-innovations will also help meet the civil legal-needs of both low- and moderate-income-folks . in partnership with the maryland legal-assistance network , a project of the maryland legal-services corp. , the bureau is developing a centralized-intake and referral-system for all legal-service-providers around the state co in other words , a legal-hotline with onestop-shopping . the effort , now in the final-months of a $ 1 million grant received by mlsc three years ago from george soros ' open society institute to create a national-demonstration-project , is the largest foundation-grant ever to a state legal-services-organization . other mlan projects include a web site for the general-public called the peoples law-library ( www.peoples-law.org ) that increases public-access to legal-information and legal pro se assistance for a variety of common legal-problems . another web site , www.mdjustice.org , assists legal-services and private pro-bono lawyers to better serve low- and moderate-income-clients . the bottom line ? it 's legal-aid 's commitment to justice . `` we at the bureau have the most exciting and satisfying-jobs in the world , '' said joseph , the bureau 's executive director . `` in a society that stresses individual achievement co where you pull yourself up by your bootstraps co the legal-aid bureau helps those without boots . `` by providing-access to justice to tens of thousands of marylanders each year , legal-aid-attorneys and support-staff bring equity and stability to society .
