texas lawyer grant provides funding to connect legal-aid call centers mary alice robbins september 9 , 2002 a $ 100,000 technology grant awarded to texas rural legal-aid will fund an austin call-center and connect it with centers in san antonio and corpus christi to assist the poor with legal-problems in a 68-county area of southwest texas . washington , d.c.-based legal-services corp. , which oversees federally funded legal-aid , awarded the grant to trla , which serves an area extending from austin south to the rio grande valley and west to el paso . the award was announced at a news conference on aug. 30 at the university of texas school of law , which is participating in the project . according to lsc , only 20 percent of the low-income texans who have a civil legal-problem are able to obtain attorneys to represent them . `` it 's a serious-problem when four out of five low-income-people in texas arrive at the courthouse-door and essentially discover they can not afford the price of admission , '' says mauricio-vivero , lsc vice-president . `` while this grant can not ensure justice for all in southwest texas , this new legal-advice-line will mean thousands more families can access critical legal-advice when they need it the most . '' trla executive director david hall says the call-in-service is more than a hotline for legal-advice . ut-law-students will staff the center and conduct the initial-interviews with clients to find out what their legal-problems are and how they can be helped . `` it provides the front-end for the lawyers in dealing with the clients , '' hall says . the idea , hall says , is to keep attorneys off the phones so that they can spend their time handling-cases . hall says that the students will do eligibility-screening to determine whether callers qualify for legal-assistance from trla . if a caller meets trla 's eligibility-requirements , a comprehensive-case-work-up will be done by a student , who may have to call a courthouse to get records on the case , he says . `` what you normally think of a hotline doing is spending about 15 minutes on the phone with somebody , giving them some quick legal-advice , hanging up the phone and going to the next-light blinking on the panel , '' hall says . `` the way we try to approach it is to identify every legal-problem that a client has . '' all the information and records that a student-obtains are filed in a computer-system accessible by trla 's attorneys throughout its service-area , hall says . this wo n't be the first time that trla has used law-students to take calls from indigents . the austin center will expand services provided by the telephone-access to justice call-center in san antonio , where st. mary 's university school of law-students man the phones . hall says the san antonio center -- opened as an experiment about five years ago -- has made `` a tremendous-difference in our ability to reach out '' to clients , whether they are in rural or urban-areas . trla also operates a small-call-in-center in corpus christi , where paralegals take the calls , he says . with funding from the grant , the three centers will be tied together in an integrated phone-system , he adds . mary christine reed , taj attorney and director , says the san antonio center opened about 5,000 client files stemming from calls received in 2001 . the goal of the austin center , which is expected to open by january 2003 , is to double the number of people served , hall says . law-students who work at the san antonio center are given an opportunity to use their legal-skills . depending on the amount of training they have , students can dispense preliminary legal-advice to clients but must document what advice they gave , reed says . reed says students also are called to assist clients in rural areas with pro se divorces for cases that she determines can be handled in that manner . the students talk to the clients on the phone to get the information on divorce-cases and prepare the pleadings , which are reviewed by attorneys before being given to clients to take to court , she says . `` we follow that client through to filing it , to getting the final-hearing , to preparing the final-decree , to making sure she gets divorced , '' reed says . reed says privilege attaches when the law-students take calls . `` they 're working basically as a paralegal or legal-assistant , '' she says . `` it 's the same as calling and speaking to a lawyer . '' reed says the san antonio center-fields calls on a number of legal-problems . about 20 percent of the callers are victims of domestic-violence who are given information about shelters where they can find help , she says . calls also come from people who have been denied food-stamps or have problems with their landlords , she says . hall says that about 20 ut-law-students will be needed to answer calls at the new center in austin . the indigents served by the center wo n't be the only ones to benefit . william powers , ut law-school-dean , says the project will benefit the students who participate , teaching them early in their careers about the need for pro-bono-service . says powers , `` this grant will help provide our students with valuable-professional experience that will help them in whatever areas they go into , but will also help them understand and have the ideals of providing legal-services to every citizen of the state .
