new york times law-schools urge graduates to start small and think local by greg winter monday , december 16 , 2002 life for the partners of cates , katalinic & lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law . instead of lunches at lut√®ce , they caucus at the palace diner in queens . wooing-clients means passing out fliers on street-corners , not securing-box-seats at madison square garden . to make ends meet , one partner-stacks-pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse . another handles urine-samples in a hospital-lab . a sign of failure , of a feeble-economy , perhaps ? hardly . they are heeding the call of a growing-pool of law-schools , which are for the first time pointing-graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there . forget the lure of large-firms , the security of a government-post . here is how to grapple `` in the service of justice , '' as many of the schools put it , instead . convinced that corporate-largess and government-programs barely dent the nation 's legal-needs , the law-schools are urging-graduates to buck tradition , pass up big-salaries and ignore mushrooming student-debt to join tiny-neighborhood-practices or simply start their own , all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford . this is not pro-bono legal-work ; it is `` low-bono , '' a term the schools coined to define the atypical-kind of law-career they are training-students for . while its practitioners do charge for their services , they are also dead-set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible . `` when you go into this kind of social-justice-law , it 's really brutal and you 're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there 's a light at the end of the tunnel , '' said fred rooney , director of the community legal resource network at city university of new york school of law , from which the lawyers of the newly formed cates , katalinic & lund graduated last may . `` but if our graduates do n't do it , the millions of people who can not access-justice in this country will continue to soar . '' the movement , primly called the consortium , started four years ago by cuny , northeastern university , the university of maryland and st. mary 's law-school in texas . ( st. mary 's later dropped out . ) since then , it has drawn seven additional-law-schools to its ranks : the university of michigan , rutgers and syracuse law-schools , new york law-school , university of new mexico school of law , thomas m. cooley law-school and touro law-school . it has elicited at least initial-interest from 19 more . mixing-foundation-money with their own to go beyond the standard-curriculum , the schools are teaching the nuts and bolts of running a business , setting up client referral-networks for fledgling-practitioners and holding-seminars to tackle the mundane-cha-llenges of going it alone that are often considered superfluous to the study of law . as further encouragement for the 200 or so followers they have picked up already , the consortium-schools have given their graduates palm organizers , paid for companies to help with their billing , and offered free legal-research and even yoga and meditation-classes , almost-anything to help make life a little easier for those trying to hang out their shingles . `` we 're talking about training real-community-lawyers , '' said stua rt l. deutsch , dean of the rutgers school of law in newark . `` the perception is that the solo-practitioners are the ones who got c 's , the second string who did n't excel enough to get to the big-firms . we 're trying to say that solo-practice can be among the highest forms of public-service , and is the only channel possible to serving-low-income people . '' true or not , there is little-debate that most low-income-clients , and many in the middle class , find lawyers well outside their financial-reach . even at the smallest of firms , the median hourly-rate starts at roughly $ 130 an hour and passes $ 180 , according to a 2002 survey by altman weil , a legal-consulting company . for firms with more than 150 lawyers in tow , the range is from $ 200 to more than $ 320 an hour , the survey found , not counting the dinners , taxi-rides and other extras that are often tacked onto the bill . at those rates , perhaps it should come as no surprise that 71 percent of low-income-people and 61 percent of moderate-income people with civil-troub les end up without representation , according to the american bar-association . for the truly-poor , meaning they earn no more than $ 11,075 a year , there are government-financed legal-aid-agencies to turn to , 172 in all , but these offices are so overwhelmed that only one in five people who qualify for help actually gets any . by contrast , big-law-firms are slowly stepping up their commitment to free-services , after 10 years of pulling back . yet their lawyers still spend less than 42 hours a year doing pro-bono-work , far-short of the profession 's guidelines to perform at least 50-volunteer-hours each year . even during more charitable-times , the bar-association says , most of the free or less costly-work is handled by small-firms and solo-practitioners , making the m a natural-target for the consortium 's sights . `` a lot of students still go to law-school because of their ideals , and they 're willing to bite the bullet , drive old cars , not buy a home and keep living a student 's life for a few more years until they get settled , '' said lovely dhillon , the former san francisco assistant-district-attorney who heads the consortium . `` it 's incumbent on us to help them . '' the consortium certainly has a lot to overcome , most notably the pull of big-law-firms . twenty years ago , three times as many law-school-graduates went into solo or tiny-practices as went to firms with more than 100 lawyers , according to the national association for law placement . by last year , the two poles had flip-flopped , with the biggest firms attracting 30 percent more graduates than the smallest , and given the difference in pay it is not hard to see why . joining a firm with fewer than 10 lawyers means starting at $ 43,000 a year , the association says . the bigger a practice gets , though , the higher its starting-salaries-climb , topping out around $ 125,000 a year at the largest firms . considering that law-school-tuitions have roughly doubled in the last decade , pushing the median-student-debt past $ 84,000 , it is understandable why some question how far the consortium can spread . `` it 's a great-idea , but the pressure of academic-debt really leads people to big-firms in big-cities , '' said theresa j. bryant , executive director of the career-development-office at yale law-school , which is not part of the consortium . `` when you 're standing $ 90,000 in debt , going small may present a bit of a challenge . '' fair enough , the consortium says . not all graduates will be able to scrounge for the years it may take to build a clientele , nor should they . but since as many as 30 percent to 40 percent of the graduates at schools like cuny go into small or solo-practices within a few years of graduating , the deans argue , it seems folly not to teach them how to stay afloat financially and take on low-income-clients at the same time . how do you advertise ? how do you bill-clients and , perhaps even trickier , get them to pay ? how can you remain affordable and still pay your rent ? what kind of office-software will you need ? how about malpractice-insurance ? such are the sobering-questions , rarely highbrow enough to find their way into legal-pedagogy , that the consortium seeks to help their graduates tackle . `` important as they are , these issues are low on the academic pecking-order , and not what get most faculty recognized , '' said deborah l. rhode , former-president of the association of american law-schools and a professor of law at stanford university , also outside the consortium . `` the truth is , legal-education is partially responsible for the disconnect between what ordinary americans need and what educated lawyers can supply . '' even for the most intrepid and socially-conscious of graduates , starting a practice requires a giant-leap of faith , and more than a little-guesswork . charging sliding-scale-fees means coming up with a new wage for almost every case one takes , and seldom can practitioners rely on anything more solid than their own judgment . `` how much will we charge ? '' tristan da cunha , one of the new graduates starting-cates , katalinic & lund asked with a shrug , furrowing his brow as if the question had never come up . `` i think it 's fair to say we 'll be heavily discounted .
