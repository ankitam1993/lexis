free legal-service on the wane budget-cut by $ 50,000 , but attorney vows central illinois poor will not be left in lurch christopher williams friday , august 30 , 2002 peoria - prairie state legal-services inc. of peoria managing-attorney lisa y. wilson vows that poor central illinoisans will continue to have free-lawyers to assist them , despite funding-cuts . `` there has been a decrease in funding to this prairie state legal-office by about $ 50,000 , '' wilson said thursday . `` that means that we will lose money to supply one attorney , but we should be able to continue to manage . it 's not having the impact as it is having in chicago '' and at other agencies statewide . wilson 's office , at 331 fulton st. , suite 600 , serves poor residents in the counties of peoria , tazewell , woodford , marshall and stark . wilson learned from eric kleiman , a spokesman for legal-services corp. - the washington , d.c.-based agency that distributes federal-money for free legal-aid-programs in illinois - that lsc will lose about $ 920,000 in congressional-funding annually . besides prairie state , lsc also funds the legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago , and alton-based land of lincoln legal-services . the cuts will take the biggest bite out of land of lincoln , a network of eight offices and 40 lawyers who help clients in southern illinois with problems such as eviction , access to social-security and obtaining-orders of protection from abusive-spouses , kleiman said . the lsc allocates money to states based on the number of poor counted in the last-census . the 2000 census showed illinois with about 35,000 fewer people who are eligible for lsc services . although the three groups deliver most of the legal-aid in illinois , dozens of other programs offer similar-services , and all will feel the pain when the lawyers trust-fund of illinois doles out grants for 2003 . the fund , created by the illinois supreme court in 1983 , gets interest from escrow-accounts and other money-lawyers often keep for their clients and spends it on legal-aid . this year , the fund will likely award just half of the $ 3.5 million it usually gives some 34 groups statewide , said ruth ann schmitt , the trust-funds executive director . the illinois general assembly has appropriated about $ 500,000 annually for legal-aid in recent years , an amount-bartylak said has not been much reduced . still , of the nation 's 10 most populated states , illinois ranks last in the amount of money-legislators appropriate for legal-aid , lsc president john erlenborn said earlier this year . peoria county state 's attorney kevin lyons said all the budget-cuts will not affect poor-criminals because the state-court appoints public-defenders .
