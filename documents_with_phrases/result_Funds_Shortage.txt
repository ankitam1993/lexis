chicago daily law bulletin coping with funds shortage is topic for legal-aid meeting daniel c. vock july 25 , 2002 springfield -- about 225 attorneys and paralegals from across illinois who provide legal-services to the poor will gather in chicago early-next week for the first time in 13 years to swap ideas and offer each other encouragement . but they 're also in for some bad news . john n. erlenborn , president of the legal-services corp. , the entity that doles out federal-money for legal-aid , will announce at the conference that illinois will suffer `` seven-figure-funding cuts '' next year because of newly released census-figures . under federal law , money for legal-aid is distributed to the states based on the number of indigent-residents . erlenborn , a former-member of the u.s. house of representatives from the chicago area , did not disclose how big the state 's hit would be but issued a statement thursday pointing out that only four states would lose more federal-money than illinois in 2003 . last year , the lsc gave illinois nearly $ 12 million -- or a third of the money going to the state 's legal-aid-programs -- to fund the legal-assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago , prairie state legal-services and land of lincoln legal-assistance foundation . legal-aid-providers in the state are already scrounging for funding as interest rates fall through the floor , because one of their primary-sources of support comes from the interest generated on client-assets held in trust by lawyers in illinois . illinois supreme court justice thomas l. kilbride will deliver the keynote-speech to the legal-aid-providers on monday and will discuss the high court 's plan to hike attorney-registration-fees by $ 42 to cover the shortfall in the interest income . the high court floated a plan during the spring-legislative session to raise those fees , which would bring in roughly $ 2.4 million and raise the base-fee for active-attorneys from $ 180 to $ 222 . that proposal languished , but many observers noted that the high court could raise the fees without legislative-approval . organizers of the conference acknowledged that much of the discussion at the event will center on how to use-resources most effectively on a shoestring-budget . in fact , all of the hotel-rooms and conference-facilities were donated to the group after another organization announced at the end of june that it was calling off its convention , leaving the facilities open , said linda zazove , deputy director of land of lincoln and a member of the conference 's planning-committee . a core-group of legal-aid-attorneys hatched the idea of a conference after visiting with representatives of similar-programs in other states who regularly hold such meetings , she said . originally , the organizers hoped for a fall-convention but they sprang at the opportunity when the rooms opened up . `` this is a unique-opportunity for people who are in the trenches delivering-services to get together , meet each other and share ideas , '' zazove said . the providers will attend sessions on car-related-consumer-law , bankruptcy , immigration , welfare , assisting pro se clients , recruiting private-attorneys and internet-resources for both advocates and clients . ruth ann schmitt , executive director of the lawyers trust-fund , which is covering some of the costs of the gathering , acknowledged that the legal-aid-community faces many problems but said the meeting could give attorneys a morale-boost . `` it 's not often that the rank and file get together to talk about their problems ... . it 's usually the leadership , '' she said . this year 's gathering is limited to lawyers and paralegals working for legal-aid-organizations . according to the lawyers trust-fund , which distributes the interest income , there are about 250 illinois lawyers working-full-time in the state 's 20 programs receiving ltf funds . another 100 attorneys work part-time for those programs . the organizers hope to expand the event in the future to include judges and private-attorneys and cover more topics in an access to justice-conference , zazove said .
