united states general-accounting-office testimony gao before the national commission on the public-service gao-02-940t chairman volcker and members of the national commission on the public-service : i am pleased to be here today to discuss the essential-actions that the federal government needs to take in order to manage its most important-asset-its-people , or human-capital . an organization 's people define its culture , drive its performance , embody its knowledge-base , and are the key to successful-merger and transformation-efforts . as such , strategic-human capital-management is the critical-element to maximizing-government 's performance and assuring its accountability for the benefit of the american people . the early-years of the 21st century are proving to be a period of profound-transition for our world , our country , and our government . this transition is being driven by a number of key-trends including : global-interdependence ; diverse , diffuse , and asymmetrical-security-threats ; rapidly evolving-science and technology ; dramatic-shifts in the age and composition of the population ; important-quality of life-issues ; the changing-nature of our economy ; and evolving-government-structures and concepts . these trends present a range of challenges that have no boundaries . these trends also contribute to a huge , longer-range fiscal and budgetary-challenge facing the united states . given these trends and longrange fiscal-challenges , the federal government needs to engage in a comprehensive-review , reassessment , and reprioritization of what the government does , how it does business , and who does the government 's business . we must re-examine a range of government-policies , programs , and operations . the status quo is simply-unacceptable . the long-range-numbers do not add up . we must re-examine the base , including our current human-capital-policies and practices . this re-examination will in turn require federal-agencies to transform their cultures and shift their overall orientation from : • processes to results , • stovepipes to matrixes , • hierarchical to flatter and more horizontal structures , • an inward-focus to an external ( citizen , customer , and stakeholder ) focus , • management-control to employee-empowerment , • reactive-behavior to proactive-approaches , • avoiding new technologies to embracing and leveraging them , • hoarding-knowledge to sharing-knowledge , • avoiding-risk to managing-risk , and • protecting-turf to forming-partnerships . leading-public organizations here in the united states and abroad have found that strategic-human capital-management must be the centerpiece of any serious change-management initiative and efforts to transform the cultures of government agencies . unfortunately , as the commission has made clear , the federal government is not well positioned to make the needed transformation . gao designated strategic-human capital-management as a governmentwide-high-risk-area in january 2001 because of a long-standing-lack of a consistent strategic-approach to marshaling , managing , and maintaining the human-capital needed for government to deliver on its promises.1 we reported then and still find today that serious human-capital-shortfalls are eroding the capacity of many agencies , and threatening the ability of others , to economically , efficiently , and effectively perform their missions.2 the federal government 's human-capital-weaknesses did not emerge overnight and will not be quickly or easily addressed . the enormous human-capital and other transformation-challenges that need to be addressed to transform the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) and create a successful department of homeland-security are instructive of the critical and difficult-task ahead.3 committed , sustained , highly-qualified , and inspired leadership , and persistent-attention by all key-parties will be essential if lasting-changes are to be made and the challenges we face across the federal government successfully addressed . fortunately , we are now seeing increased-attention to strategic-human capital-management and a real and growing-momentum for change is now evident since we placed strategic-human capital-management on our high-risk-list . • in august 2001 , president bush placed human-capital at the top of his management-agenda . u.s. general-accounting-office , high-risk series : an update , gao-01-263 ( washington , d.c. : january 2001 ) . u.s. general-accounting-office ,

management-scorecard and mid-point-review process . • as one of its many efforts to help agencies with these issues , the office of personnel-management ( opm ) released a human-capital scorecard last december to assist-agencies in responding to the omb scorecard . • finally , congress has underscored the consequences of human-capital-weaknesses in federal-agencies and pinpointed solutions through the oversight-process and a wide-range of hearings held over the last few years . 1 2 3 therefore , the key-question-today is how do we best seize the opportunity and build on the current-momentum ? i have often noted that the first step toward meeting the government 's human-capital-challenges is for agency-leaders to identify and make use of all the appropriate administrative-authorities available to them to manage their people for results both effectively and equitably . much of the authority-agency-leaders need to manage human-capital strategically is already-available under current-laws and regulations . agency-leaders should not wait for comprehensive-human capital legislative-reforms to happen . the use of these authorities often needs to be undertaken as part of , and consistent with , proven change-management-practices . the second step is for policymakers to pursue incremental legislative-reforms to give agencies additional-tools and flexibilities to hire , manage , and retain the human-capital they need , particularly in critical-occupations . key-provisions of legislative-proposals under consideration in congress represent an important-step to helping-agencies address their human-capital-management challenges . many of the provisions contained in the bills are consistent with authorities we have been urging for other federal agencies.4 the third-step toward meeting the federal government 's human-capital-challenges is for all interested parties to work together to identify the kinds of comprehensive-legislative reforms in the human-capital-area that should be enacted over time . these reforms should place greater emphasis on knowledge , skills , and performance in connection with federal-employment , promotion , and compensation decisions , rather than on the passage of time , the rate of inflation , or geographic-location , as is often the case-today . shockingly , over 80 u.s. general-accounting-office ,

help transform agencies percent of the cost associated with the annual-increases in federal-salaries is due to cost-of-living and locality-pay adjustment . this must change . today , i will discuss three broad human-capital-reform opportunities that are instrumental to agency-transformation efforts and that the commission may want to consider as its work moves forward . these broad-opportunities include : first , aligning individual and organizational-performance ; second and directly related to that , implementing resultsoriented-pay-reform ; and third , sustaining agency-transformation efforts . i will conclude with some comments on how we in gao are playing a constructive-role in helping the government address its human-capital-challenges , including our efforts to `` lead by example '' in this critically-important area . leading-organizations use their performance-management-systems as a key-tool for aligning institutional , unit , and employee-performance ; achieving-results ; accelerating-change ; managing the organization on a day-to-day-basis ; and facilitating-communication throughout the year so that discussions about individual and organizational-performance are integrated and ongoing.5 performance-management-systems in these leading-organizations typically seek to achieve three key-objectives . first , they strive to provide candid and constructive-feedback to help individual-employees maximize their potential in understanding and realizing the goals and objectives of the agency . second , they seek to provide management with the objective and fact-based-information it needs to reward top-performers . third , performance-management-systems provide the necessary-information and documentation to deal with poor-performers . most federal-performance management-systems fail to achieve these objectives . in addition , many federal-agencies are just beginning to recognize that their performance-management-systems can be strategic-tools to achieve success . in my opinion , modernizing agency-performance appraisal and management-systems and linking them to agency strategic-plans and desired-outcomes should be a top priority . results-oriented-performance-agreements are one mechanism in a performance-management-system that creates a `` line of sight '' showing 5 u.s. general-accounting-office , human-capital : key-principles from nine private-sector-organizations , gao/ggd-00-28 ( washington , d.c. : jan. 31 , 2000 ) . page 4 gao-02-940t how individual-employees can contribute to overall-organizational goals . 6 agencies that effectively implement such systems must first align agency-leaders ' performance-expectations with organizational-goals and then cascade-performance-expectations to other organizational-levels . these employees are then held accountable for their contributions to achieve desired results . our work has shown that agencies have benefited from their use of results-oriented-performance-agreements for political and senior-career-executives . the performance-agreements • strengthened alignment of results-oriented-goals with daily-operations , • fostered collaboration across organizational-boundaries , • enhanced-opportunities to discuss and routinely use-performance information to make program-improvements , • provided a results-oriented-basis for individual accountability , and • maintained continuity of program-goals during leadership transitions . governmentwide , agencies need to place increased emphasis on holding senior executives accountable for organizational-goals . opm amended-regulations that change the way agencies evaluate the members of the senior-executive service ( ses ) . while agencies will need to tailor their performance-management-systems to their unique organizational-requirements and climates , they nonetheless are to : hold-executives accountable for results ; appraise-executive-performance on those results balanced against other dimensions , including-customer-satisfaction and employee-perspective ; and use those results as the basis for performance-awards and other personnel-decisions . agencies were to implement the new policies for the ses appraisal-cycles that began in 2001 . ultimately , an effective-performance-management system must link-pay and incentive-programs to individual-knowledge , skills , and contributions to achieving organizational-results . the affect of poor-performers on agencies ' performance and morale can far exceed their small-numbers . still , while important , dealing with poor-performers is only part of the challenge ; agencies need to create additional-incentives and rewards for valuable and high-performing employees who represent the vast majority of the federal-workforce . congress and the administration have repeatedly expressed a commitment to more fully link resources to results . the american people expect and deserve this linkage as well . however , we u.s. general-accounting-office , managing for results : emerging-benefits from selected-agencies ' use of performance-agreements , gao-01-115 ( washington , d.c. : oct. 30 , 2000 ) . page 5 gao-02-940t will never achieve this linkage without modern and effective-performance-management strategies . additional information on the performance-management-programs in use in agencies and the relative strengths and weaknesses of those programs , along with best practice-information , would prove very helpful as agencies seek to link-pay to individual-knowledge , skills , and performance . efforts to link federal-pay to knowledge , skills , and performance should be part of a broader effort to align resource-decisions to results . as i noted , fostered in part by the government-performance and results act ( gpra ) , there has been an increasing-interest within the executive-branch and the congress in linking-performance and results to resource-allocation and other decisions . consistent with that view , we need to continue efforts to shift agency accountability-with appropriate-safeguards and oversight- to budgeted-resources and results and away from other inputs and processes . the work of the recently completed commercial activities panel , which i had the privilege of chairing , is illustrative in this regard.7 one of the sourcing-principles adopted by the panel was that the federal government 's sourcing policy should avoid arbitrary-full-time-equivalent ( fte ) or other numerical-goals . the principle is based on the unarguable-point that the success of government-programs should be measured by the results achieved in terms of providing-value to the taxpayer , not the size of the in-house or contractor-workforce . i believe that the panel 's principle should also apply to resource-allocation generally . we need to continue- and even augment-efforts to shift the focus of management , resource-allocation , and decisionmaking from inputs and process to a greater focus on results and outcomes and to provide management reasonable-flexibility while incorporating appropriate-safeguards to prevent abuse . in this regard , holding-managers accountable for results based on a specific-dollar-allocation versus fte caps would be a major-step in the right-direction . as you know , i believe that a greater emphasis should be placed on knowledge , skills , and performance in connection with federal oriented-approach to employment-promotion and compensation decisions at all levels , rather than the passage of time , the rate of inflation , or geographic-location , as so often is the case-today . in recent years , widespread-concern has been 7 commercial activities panel , improving the sourcing-decisions of the government : final-report ( washington , d.c. : april 2002 ) . page 6 gao-02-940t ensuring leadership and accountability for agencies ' transformation-efforts expressed about the methodology and results of the procedures to determine the federal-pay-gap . these concerns are among the reasons that the pay-gap has never been fully addressed . i believe that careful-study is needed to develop more realistic and workable methodologies and solutions to federal-pay-issues . part of that assessment should focus on options for moving away from a compensation-system that contains governmentwide-pay-increases with locality-adjustments , and toward a system that is based to a greater degree on the knowledge , skills , and performance of the individuals involved . i fully appreciate that much-work may be needed before agencies' respective performance-management-systems are able to support a more direct-link between pay and individual-knowledge , skills , and performance . opm certainly has a continuing and vital-role to play in connection with these issues . opm 's recently released white-paper on federal-pay provides a good-foundation for the results-oriented pay reform discussion that must now take place.8 the greater-use of `` broadbanding '' is one of the options that deserves to be discussed . in the short term , congress may wish to explore the benefits of ( 1 ) providing opm with additional-flexibility that would enable it to grant governmentwide-authority for all agencies ( i.e. , class-exemptions ) to use broadbanding for certain critical-occupations and/or ( 2 ) allowing-agencies to apply to opm ( i.e. , case-exemptions ) for broadbanding-authority for their specific critical-occupations . however , agencies should be required to demonstrate to opm 's satisfaction that they have modern , effective , and validated performance-management-systems before they are allowed to use broadbanding . the nature and scope of the cultural-transformation that needs to take place in many agencies across the federal government will take years to accomplish-easily outrunning the tenures of most political-appointees . at the same time , gao 's work over the years , most prominently in our high-risk and performance and accountability series , has amply documented that many agencies suffer from a range of long-standing-management-challenges and a lack of attention to basic-stewardship-responsibilities , 8 office of personnel-management , a white-paper : a fresh start for federal-pay : the case for modernization ( washington , d.c. : april 2002 ) . page 7 gao-02-940t requiring concerted-action and sustained top-level-attention if they are to be addressed.9 one option for addressing the issues-agencies face is to create a chief-operating-officer ( coo ) position for selected-agencies that would provide the sustained-management-attention essential for addressing-key stewardship-responsibilities in an integrated manner while helping to facilitate the transformation-process within an agency.10 these long-term-responsibilities are professional and nonpartisan in nature . they cover a range of `` good-government '' responsibilities that are fundamental to effectively executing any administration 's program-agenda . statutory-coos would differ from-but hopefully complement-the-roles often assumed by the current deputy secretaries in assisting the secretaries in executing the administration 's policy and program-agenda and achieving an agency 's mission . the good-government-responsibilities that could be led by a coo include : • strategic-planning , • organizational-alignment , • core-values-stewardship , • human-capital-strategy , • performance-management ( aligning institutional , unit , and individual-measurement and reward systems to achieve overall-organizational goals ) , • communications and information-technology-management , • financial-management , • acquisition-management , • risk management , • knowledge-management , • matrix-management , and • change-management . 9 for example , see u.s. general-accounting-office , energy markets : concerted-actions needed by ferc to confront challenges that impede effective-oversight , gao-02-656 ( washington , d.c. : june 14 , 2002 ) ; hud management : progress made on management-reforms , but challenges remain , gao-02-45 ( washington , d.c. : oct. 31 , 2001 ) ; major-management-challenges and program-risks : department of energy ,

, 2000 ) . 10 see u.s. general-accounting-office , architect of the capitol : management and accountability framework needed to lead and execute change , gao-02-632t ( washington , d.c. : apr . 17 , 2002 ) ; and gao-02-528t . while various-models for structuring such a position could be used , one option would be to have a coo who is appointed , subject to senate confirmation , to a term of 5 to 7 years ( generally considered to be the minimum-time needed for major-change-initiatives to provide meaningful and sustainable-results ) . the coo should be at an organizational-level-equivalent to the current deputies in major-departments and agencies in order to help assure the effectiveness of this position . a term-appointment would help to provide continuity that spans the tenure of the political-leadership to ensure that long-term-stewardship-issues are addressed and change-management-initiatives are successfully completed . the individual would be selected without regard to political-affiliation based on ( 1 ) demonstrated-leadership-skills in managing large and complex-organizations , and ( 2 ) experience achieving-results in connection with a number of the above responsibilities . to further clarify-accountability , the coo could be subject to a clearly defined , results-oriented-performance contract with appropriate-incentive , reward , and accountability-mechanisms . if congress and the executive-branch decide to move forward with the coo approach , it may make sense to use a pilot in a select number of agencies using a value and risk-based-approach . for example , an agency that is experiencing particularly-significant challenges in integrating disparate organizational-cultures ( such as the proposed department of homeland-security ) may be an especially-appropriate first phase-candidate . agencies engaged in major-transformation-efforts , like the fbi , the internal revenue service ( irs ) , and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) could also benefit from such an approach . similarly , a `` challenged agency '' -one that has longstanding management-weaknesses and high-risk-operations or functions , such as the department of defense ( dod ) -may also be a good first phase candidate.11 the point would be for the congress , executive-branch leadership in omb and opm , agencies , and others to gain experience with the coo approach before deciding how and where it should be applied across the government . more generally , we need to comprehensively examine opportunities for better using the federal government 's career ses leadership . this examination should focus on a number of issues that have been suggested u.s general-accounting-office , dod financial-management : integrated-approach , accountability , transparency , and incentives are keys to effective-reform , gao-02-497t ( washington , d.c. : mar . 6 , 2002 ) . page 9 gao-02-940t gao 's constructive-efforts to help agencies address their human-capital-challenges to strengthen the ses and thereby improve federal-performance and foster transformation-efforts . these issues include , for example , concerns over ses compensation and pay compression . i believe that the issue of whether and how much to increase ses pay must be discussed within the context of how to make any pay increases variable and performance-based rather than across-the-board and fixed . we also must carefully examine the composition of the ses . it seems to me that , in general , current members of the ses fill three broad-roles : executive-leadership , program-management , and senior technical and specialists-positions . we need to look at the implications that these differing-roles have for a range of issues , such as ses core-competencies , performance-standards , recruitment-sources , mobility , and training and development-programs . we also need to look at whether the number of levels within the ses ( i.e . es 1 through 6 ) are necessary and appropriate . as the federal government 's leading-accountability-organization , we have made a concerted-effort to identify and encourage the implementation of human-capital-practices that improve the efficiency , effectiveness , and accountability of the federal government . over the last few years , we have issued numerous reports with practical-recommendations on the steps individual-agencies can take to address their specific human-capital challenges.12 in addition , we have reported on governmentwide trends and lessons learned by successful organizations.13 we also understand that we have a responsibility to `` lead by example '' and '' practice what we preach '' in all key-management-areas , including strategic-human capital-management . 12 for example , see u.s. general-accounting-office , human-capital : practices that empowered and involved-employees , gao-01-1070 ( washington , d.c. : sept. 14 , 2001 ) ;

gao/ggd-00-113br ( washington , d.c. : may 12 , 2000 ) . on march 15 , 2002 , we released a model of strategic-human capital-management , the latest in a series of tools designed to assist agency-leaders in effectively managing their people.14 our model is designed to help agency-leaders effectively-lead and manage their people and integrate human-capital-considerations into daily-decision-making and the program-results they seek to achieve . in so doing , the model highlights the importance of a sustained-commitment by agency-leaders to maximize the value of their agencies ' human-capital and to manage related-risks . accordingly , it raises the bar for all of us-those in positions of leadership , federal-managers , employees , unions , and human-capital-executives and their teams . consistent with opm 's and omb 's views , our model of strategic-human capital-management embodies an approach that is fact-based , focused on strategic-results , and incorporates merit-principles and other national-goals . as such , the model reflects two principles central to the human-capital-idea : • people are assets whose value can be enhanced through investment . as with any investment , the goal is to maximize value while managing-risk . • an organization 's human-capital-approaches should be designed , implemented , and assessed by the standard of how well they help the organization pursue its mission and achieve desired results or outcomes . the model highlights the kinds of thinking that agencies should apply , as well as some of the steps they can take , to make progress in managing human-capital strategically . the concepts presented in the model are arranged around eight critical-success-factors , which are organized in pairs to correspond with four cornerstones of effective strategic-human capital-management . ( see fig . 1 . ) u.s. general-accounting-office , a model of strategic-human capital-management , gao-02-373sp ( washington , d.c. : mar . 15 , 2002 ) . page 11 gao-02-940t figure 1 : critical-success-factors organized by human-capital cornerstones 4 human-capital cornerstones 8 critical-success-factors as i noted before , opm and omb also have developed tools that are being used to assess human-capital-management efforts . we provided-drafts of our human-capital-model to opm and omb for their review prior to publication to help ensure that the three efforts are conceptually-consistent . we hope that the perspective and information provided in our page 12 gao-02-940t gao 's efforts to lead by example model will help inform agencies ' efforts to respond to the administration 's management-initiatives , such as `` getting to green '' on omb 's management-scorecard and using the tools developed by opm . while we remain sensitive of the need to maintain our institutional independence , we are working constructively with opm , omb , and others to explore opportunities to develop a more fully integrated set of guidance and tools for agencies to address their human-capital challenges.15 in addition to providing-tools to help agencies help themselves , we believe it is our responsibility to lead by example . we are in the vanguard of the federal government 's efforts to modernize existing human-capital-strategies and we are committed to staying in this position . our people are our most valuable-asset and it is only through their combined efforts that we can effectively serve our clients and our country . by managing our workforce strategically and focusing on results , we are helping to maximize our own performance and ensure our own accountability . by doing so , we also hope to demonstrate to other federal-agencies that they can make similar-improvements in the way they manage their people . we have identified and made use of a variety of tools and flexibilities , some of which were made available to us through the gao personnel act of 1980 and our 2000 legislation , but most of which are available to federal-agencies . the most prominent-change in human-capital-management that we implemented as a result of the gao personnel act of 1980 was a broadbanded-pay-for-performance-system . the primary-goal of this system is to base employee-compensation primarily on the knowledge , skills , and performance of individual-employees . it provides managers-flexibility to assign employees in a manner that is more suitable to multi-tasking and the full-use of staff . under our current broadbanded-system , analyst and analyst-related-staff in grades 7 through 15 were placed in three bands . we expect to modify our banded-system in the future based on our experience to date . 15 u.s. general-accounting-office , managing for results : next-steps to improve the federal government 's management and performance , gao-02-439t ( washington , d.c. : feb. 15 , 2002 ) . page 13 gao-02-940t in january 2002 , we implemented a new competency-based performance-management-system that is intended to create a clear linkage between employee-performance and our strategic-plan and core-values . it includes 12 competencies that our employees overwhelmingly validated as the keys to meaningful-performance at gao . ( see fig . 2 . ) figure 2 : gao 's competency-based model our october 2000 legislation gave us additional-tools to : realign our workforce in light of mission-needs and overall budgetary-constraints ; correct-skills-imbalances ; and reduce high-grade , managerial , or supervisory-positions without reducing the overall-number of gao employees . this legislation allowed us to create a technical and scientific-career-track at a compensation level consistent to the ses . it also allowed us to give greater consideration to performance and employee-skills and knowledge in any reduction-in-force-actions . we believe that other agencies could benefit from these additional-authorities . since the legislation was enacted , we have established agency regulations and conducted and completed our first offering of voluntary early-retirement-opportunities . once employees registered their interest in participating in the program , we considered a number of factors including : employee-knowledge , skills , performance , and competencies ; the organizational-unit or subunit in which an employee worked ; an employee 's occupational-series , grade , or band-level , as appropriate ; and the geographic-location of the employee . as authorized by the 2000 legislation , employee-performance was just one of many factors we considered when deciding which employees would be allowed to receive the incentives . however , let me assure you , we did not use-performance to target certain-individuals . we are also using many recruiting-flexibilities that are available to most agencies , including an extensive-campaign to increase our competitiveness on college-campuses and extending offers of employment during the fall-semester to prospective employees who will come on board the following-spring and summer . we are also using our internship-program in a strategic-fashion and we often offer permanent-positions to gao interns with at least 10 weeks of highly-successful work-experience . moreover , we are building and maintaining a strong-presence of both senior executives and recent-graduates on targeted-college-campuses . we have also taken steps to streamline and expedite our hiring process . in this regard , the current-length of time that it takes to hire a person in most other federal-agencies is much too long and must be addressed . even after we hire good-people , we need to take steps to retain them . we have taken a number of steps to empower and invest in our employees . for example , we have active-employee-feedback and suggestion-programs . in addition , we are in the midst of implementing our first student loan-repayment-assistance program for about 200 employees who have indicated interest and are willing to make a three-year-commitment to staying with the agency . overall , we have implemented the following-initiatives and targeted-investments , some of which are relatively-recent and some of which are longstanding:16 • prepared a human-capital-profile and needs assessment to understand employee-demographics and distribution . • conducted an employee-survey in 1999 and 2002 to understand the status and progress of the agency and the areas in which we need to improve . • completed a knowledge and skills-inventory for all employees . • conducted an employee-preference-survey so that employees could be given the opportunity to work in the areas that interest and energize them in light of our institutional-needs . • implemented an executive candidate development-program to prepare candidates for assignments in the ses . • initiated a professional-development program for newly hired gao analysts to help them transition and progress . • initiated a redesign of our training-curriculum to directly link and support our validated core-competencies . • established an employee advisory council to facilitate open-communication and direct-input from line-employees to the comptroller general and other gao senior-leadership . • provided an on-site child-care center called `` tiny findings '' and the wellness and fitness center . • implemented additional employee-friendly-benefits such as business casual-dress , flextime , and public-transportation subsidies . • used recruitment-bonuses , retention-allowances , and student loan-repayment-assistance to attract and retain employees with specialized skills . • implemented a new `` state of the art '' performance-appraisal-system that is linked to our strategic-plan and based on key-competencies . as we engage in these changes , we also know that we are not perfect and we never will be . this is a work-in-progress for us as it is for others . our approaches are not the only way for agencies to proceed , but they can help others identify ways to address their individual human-capital-challenges . in this regard , we have shared our lessons and experiences with others , and are happy to do so . 16 for more information on these efforts , see human-capital : taking-steps to meet current and emerging human-capital-challenges , gao-01-965t ( washington , d.c. : july 17 , 2001 ) . page 16 gao-02-940t in summary , mr. chairman , i believe that there is no more important-management-reform than for agencies to transform their cultures to respond to the transition that is taking place in the role of government in the 21st century . strategic-human capital-management must be at the center of this transformation-effort . we all need to seize the momentum that has recently-emerged-agencies must use existing-authorities to strategically manage their people ; congress needs to consider some statutory-changes in the short term ; and all interested parties need to work together toward enactment of more comprehensive civil-service-reform over time . i look forward to continuing to work with congress , opm , omb , agencies , the national commission on the public-service , and other interested parties as we jointly seek to ensure that the federal government modernizes its human-capital-strategies in order to maximize performance , assure accountability , transform itself , and prepare for the future . chairman volcker and members of the commission , this concludes my statement . i would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have . for further information regarding this statement , please contact j . contact and christopher mihm , director , strategic issues , on ( 202 ) 512-6806 or at acknowledgments mihmj @ gao.gov . individuals making-key contributions to this testimony included amy choi , rebecka derr , judith kordahl , ellen rubin , lisa shames , and ed stephenson .
