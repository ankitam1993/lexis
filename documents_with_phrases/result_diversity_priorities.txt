( held may 31 and june 1 in washington . d.c. ) overview on may 31 and june 1 , 2001 , approximately fifty equal-justice advocates gathered in washington , dc for lsc 's and nlada 's first national-conference on diversity in the legal-services-community . focusing on broad-aspects of diversity - including , among others , age , gender , disability , sexual-orientation , race , ethnicity and national-origin - participants examined diversity-related-strengths and challenges facing-clients , staff and program-leaders ( both local and national ) , and brainstormed about potential-strategies for addressing the challenges . to ensure that the dialogue would include the variety of issues and individuals in the legal-services-community , nlada and lsc selected-participants to reflect both the leadership and emerging-leadership of the field . to the maximum-extent possible , participants broadly mirrored the full-population of the national-community . attendance at the meeting was limited to about 50 people to foster candid-conversation . two members of the karp consulting group ( deborah howard and yvonne shinhoster lamb ) facilitated the two-day-session . all participants understood that , while the assembled group reflected the demographics of the community , they did not speak for every member of the broad-based legal-services-community . it should be noted also that no clients were involved in this event . thus the vision and strategies suggested here must be seen and considered in the context of a series of dialogues on diversity that nlada and lsc are holding throughout the year and in the context of the reports issued following those conversations . participants began the conference by setting-goals . they included the following : • identify and prioritize diversity-related-issues that exist within the legal-services-community . • identify key diversity-related-challenges that exist internally and externally . • identify obstacles within our legal-services-community that cause and/or perpetuate-bias , oppression , and unfairness . • brainstorm-strategies to address the identified issues , overcome the challenges and obstacles , and to promote justice , fairness , and inclusion . in order to facilitate the ability of the participants to work from an agreed upon set of facts about themselves , the facilitators divided the conferees into three groups . each group represented a time in the history of legal-services -- the past ( 20 years ago ) , the present and the future ( 10 years from now ) . each group was then asked to answer the same set of questions about their particular era . the thoughts and observations of each group are reported below . the past • key-constituents included-clients and community-based-organizations , local-bar-associations , client advisory-committees , lsc , other funders ( such as united way ) and policy-advocates like nlada . • the client-community included a high number of welfare recipients , was majority white and female with some regional-differences and included some undocumented-individuals , elderly , non-working poor and prisoners . • program-staff was less diverse . fewer women worked in legal-services , particularly as lawyers . management then was almost exclusively-white , male , younger and inexperienced . there were fewer indigenous-staff-members . • program-staff members were treated with a `` sink or swim '' attitude . although they were expected to handle large-caseloads almost immediately , they were also freer to pursue an issue-area and develop themselves professionally through that pursuit . program-leaders believed that poverty could be eradicated and accordingly staff-energies were often focused on impact-work rather than on access . legal-services-organizations were centered on the eradication of poverty and promoting-equality and justice and independence . • although there was concern about diversity , there was neither real-dedication to making it happen nor any real accountability with one exception -- the importance of hiring african american-attorneys and having african american representation on boards in regions where african american populations resided . other than that , little-attention was given to retaining and promoting-people of color , women , people with disabilities and others who reflected the client-community . however , there was an awareness of the need to hire nonlegal-staff from the communities being served and this meant that staff workforces often consisted of male , white-attorneys and female paraprofessional-staff . • some litigation was discrimination-based , i.e. , school desegregation and voting-rights-cases . • staff-training was usually not a priority for individual-programs and was generally provided by state and national-back-up centers . • some national-organizations recognized the need for greater gender-diversity and pursued-activities to bring women into the legal-services-workforce . the present • today 's key-constituents include governing and policy boards and clients ( those being served and those not being served ) . other constituents are congress , state and local-bar-associations , court-systems , new funders ( iolta , state government , department of justice violence against women office ) `` old '' funders ( lsc , united way ) , state and local governments , staff , social and human-services organizations , and civil-rights and other advocacy-groups ( most of which did not exist 20 years ago ) . • the client-community has changed . women , senior-citizens and the working poor still need our services , but new groups have emerged . programs are now expected to serve gay , lesbian and transgendered-persons , persons with aids , children , homeless-people , more immigrants ( many of whom do not speak english and have complex-problems ) , persons with disabilities , unemployed-persons , people of color , rural and urban-low-income-people , people from depressed-areas , and those with mental-illness . • our staffs include more women , people with disabilities , individuals from the community , eligible-clients , gay , lesbian and transgendered-persons , people of color , people from diverse economic-backgrounds , and single and married-parents . these staff-members tend to embrace the belief that each person who needs a lawyer should have one , and that this is critical to moving-people out of poverty . however , although motivated by the desire to serve and empower all people with legal-problems , programs pragmatically recognize the need to prioritize and focus their legal-work on the community 's most serious-problems . • the present-values include a commitment to quality-work and respect for clients . • today 's programs emphasize such activities as training and cle opportunities for staff , mentoring , team-building and strategic-planning . programs are exploring flexible-work-schedules , incentive-awards , higher salaries and loan-forgiveness-initiatives . staff are encouraged to be active in the community and in bar-association activities . • many programs hold diversity-training-sessions for staff and boards . recruitment and retention-efforts often reflect the importance of a diverse-workplace and the commitment of board and staff to this value . client-communities are more diverse and programs have more bilingual-staff-members . offices are more accessible to people with disabilities in part because of the americans with disabilities act . in some programs , management-structures have become broader to accommodate new supervisors and approaches . some managers have shown themselves willing to address uncomfortable-issues , give up power and make difficult financial commitments to achieve a diverse-work-environment . nonetheless , serious-diversity-challenges continue to affect our community . • a concern in the present is translating the national dialogue on diversity to local-action . how can programs strengthen their efforts to hire and retain a diverse-staff as well as develop diverse-leadership ? how do we encourage programs to hire people of color , women , people with disabilities , gays and lesbians and other nonmajority-employees ? how do we create opportunities for minorities and women ( and younger staff ) to advance ? how do we engage boards of directors in these efforts ? • today 's diversity-approaches stress inclusion of people of color , people with disabilities , gays , lesbians , older people and women . in the present we recognize that barriers are not excuses . we realize that diversity can help-programs reach clients in a more appropriate and useful way , and we recognize the need to increase staff communication skills including-fluency in languages other than english . we acknowledge that sharing-power is often-key to achieving-diversity in program-leadership . the future • key-constituents will include older and aging-clients . the client-population will be multinational due to the continuing influx of immigrants . there will be more women , children and employed people along with those with mental-health needs . • community-partnerships will expand , enhanced by the growth of state-justice-communities and the many stakeholders engaged in state-planning . the importance and impact of non-lsc funders will increase . • staff-members will reflect the community-population and include more people with second and third-languages and individuals who are immigrants or firstgeneration americans . we will employ more people who are not lawyers and those embarking on second or third-careers . our leadership will reflect the expanded diversity in the general-program-population . • there will be a greater emphasis on technology-skills . office schedules will be more flexible ( to accommodate staff ) and non-traditional ( to accommodate clients ) . programs will gain higher visibility in multicultural-communities . • the legal-services-community will expand its hiring , retention and training-activities in the multicultural-community . innovative loan-forgiveness programs will attract diverse-staff . it will nurture a cadre of multiculturally-competent and innovative leaders . diversity will be reflected in our community 's everyday culture . partnerships with non-traditional-organizations will grow and new definitions of diversity and leadership will be crafted . we will pursue affirmative challenges to institutional-oppression and disparate-treatment . we will concern ourselves with the clash between groups as a result of changing-demographics , and with the clash between `` the law '' and our vision for inclusion as a justice-imperative . the need for a diverse-workforce within the legal-services-community turning to the importance of diversity , participants agreed that giving-diversity-concerns their time , energy , attention and resources will generate big-dividends . participants agreed that a diverse-staff creates a better product and strengthens client-trust in the program . they felt that a diverse-environment-fosters personal-growth and leads to an appreciation of differences in others . diversity allows us to tap into human-genius , inspiration and excitement . it makes us aware of the special-needs of disenfranchised-groups . it empowers clients and staff , strengthens the organization and improves ties to other groups . however , participants also agreed that a highly-diverse staff is not achieved without certain-difficulties . diversity `` pioneers '' often feel the fatigue and isolation of being the only or among a few people of color , women , persons with disabilities , gays or other representatives of minority-groups in their office . proponents of increased diversity may face criticism from staff or supervisors for `` spending too much time on diversity . '' since legal-services people often think of themselves as `` progressives '' who do n't need further education on issues of inclusion , making diversity-work within programs is not easy and requires the support and the guidance of committed-leaders . helping-staff and boards arrive at a common-vision necessitates honest and sometimes-difficult conversations . all participants agreed on the following : • turning-words into action requires establishing-goals and setting realistic-timeframes and benchmarks ( without setting an end-date ) ; • success is easier to obtain if people are not made defensive ; • framing-diversity-efforts in positive and practical-terms will allow proponents to move beyond the `` moral-imperative '' approach ; • budgets and other resources must be revised to support the new effort ; • policies will need to be strengthened to accommodate more aggressive and urgent-strategies . building and retaining a diverse-staff and board is a major-challenge for most programs . many conferees believe that increasing-salaries and benefits and developing loan-forgiveness programs will go a long way to attracting a more diverse-staff . seeing opportunities for advancement and leadership-positions in programs is critical to retaining-women , people of color and other individuals who contribute to a diverse-staff . an active and authentic-commitment to diversity throughout each program is essential . a core-group can begin the work , but structural and programmatic-changes -- mentoring , opportunities to talk about real-problems and see solutions implemented , power-sharing , diverse boards of directors , new definitions of leadership -- will be necessary to achieve lasting-change . all conferees agreed that a program 's belief in the value of diversity is best shown by the extent to which it devotes time , money and people to achieving it . critical issues after identifying the benefits and challenges of focusing on diversity and developing-strategies to maximize the benefits and overcome the challenges , participants identified internal and external-issues that they wanted to spend more time discussing . internal-issues selected for further discussion included the following : • recruitment and retention of diverse leadership/governance • recruitment and retention of minorities • perception that programs have withdrawn from discrimination-based-advocacy the top external-issues included : • lack of a common definition/vision of diversity • loss of trust among communities because of perception that programs are no longer dealing with discrimination-based-issues ( and resulting-tension between african-americans and hispanics ) • making-justice-communities more diverse , inclusive and multiculturally-competent • creating organizational-cultures to address a broader range of legal-issues than we do now1 conferees agreed that leadership is broader than just '' management '' and that the concept of leadership rests on power-sharing . conferees further noted that possibilities for promotion among women and members of `` disenfranchised-groups '' must be in place to ensure that `` diversity '' goes beyond race . additionally , women-managers and minority-managers can not be held to unreasonable expectations and higher standards than those applied to heterosexual white-men . conferees believe that programmatic-growth rests on a common-definition and vision of diversity and earmarking-resources so that goals are attained . programs need to come up with innovative-ways of supporting-people who are advocates for diversity , including charging certain-staff-members to `` reach out '' to others to overcome possibly hidden-discrimination ( such as discrimination-members of religious-groups and gays/lesbians/bi-sexual and transgender persons ) . sensitivity to differences must be constantly encouraged . we should be particularly-careful not to refer clients elsewhere merely because their issues or situations are unpopular . programs should consider reengaging in discrimination-based-advocacy if that approach has been abandoned or overlooked in recent years . 1 participants gave-issues 3 and 4 the same number of votes , tying them for third-place . conferees found that programs lacked a common-definition and vision of diversity . some felt that there had been loss of trust by clients from `` disenfranchised '' groups because of a belief that legal-services-programs have pulled away from discrimination-based initiatives . with respect to challenges at the local-level , conferees discussed the need for programs to create cultures that address more complex-issues ( for example , mental-health and race issues ) . on a broader level , conferees agreed that we must work to ensure that both individual-state justice-communities and the broader national-counterpart becomes more diverse , inclusive and multiculturally-competent . participants agreed that in order to identify and serve groups that remain isolated , we need to broaden our language-bases , bring more qualified-support-staff to our programs , use-community-leaders and be sensitive to tension between disenfranchised-communities . vision for success after prioritizing their primary-issues , conferees then listed indicators by which success in achieving diverse-communities of justice could be defined . indicators are grouped by topic and summarized by theme . leadership indicators of success -- our senior management includes more women , gays , lesbians , people of color , older people and people with disabilities . leaders are held accountable for progress in meeting-goals that ensure our programs and state-justice-communities are diverse throughout , maintaining a `` glittering mosaic . '' from novel power-sharing-arrangements , new leaders and leadership-models emerge . local and national-initiatives are established to nurture and promote them . program-boards indicators of success -- boards contain representatives from a greater variety of groups . national , state and local-program-boards reflect the diversity of the communities they serve . state-justice-communities indicators of success -- we endorse a common-vision of diversity and goal for achievement on the national , state and local-levels , and diversity-issues are included in every state-plan . effective policies that implement diversity-goals are adopted throughout each state . our goals and related-efforts as contained in state-plans are based on a deeper understanding of client-demographics published in the new census-material . we have crafted innovative-strategies for reaching severely marginalized communities and our statistics show that they are working . program-staff and stakeholders are engaged in a full-range of client-services , address a full-range of legal-problems , and have assumed the responsibility to create greater access and capacity to solve them . programs and staff indicators of success -- salaries and compensation-packages are competitive with other nonprofit and public-interest-organizations . funding-allocations reflect the high priority that programs-place on aggressive discrimination-based-advocacy and attaining-diversity goals . programs offer a broader range of services to the community based on an expanded definition of advocacy , moving beyond litigation and conventional-lawyering . national funders indicators of success -- money is available to implement innovative-diversity-agendas and model-projects . action planning participants drew up an action-plan that could bring about their vision and in the context of what they anticipate the future will hold in terms of issues , funding and staff . their ideas and initiatives can be implemented at the local and national-levels . recruitment and retention of diverse leadership/governance steps are initiated to allow program-board-membership to reflect the clienteligible-community and include representatives from the funding-community , corporations and other partners . each board is required to have a standing-committee to monitor board and program-diversity . a national-leadership-institute is created and begins to identify , recruit , mentor and otherwise train diverse-leaders ; its participants include at least 1-2 staff from each program ; it is adequately funded . compensation-structures in legal-services-programs anticipate long-term-tenure and include pension-plans , flexible-schedules and benefits that reward longevity . recruitment and retention of minorities data on retention and recruitment over the past decade is gathered and made available by national-organizations ; these groups compile and disseminate-information on successful-diversity initiatives . programs begin to conduct exit-interviews that seek to understand the reasons for staff-turnover . programs begin to establish formal-mentoring-systems for staff . personnel-policies will be revised so that they further encourage and support a diverse-work-environment and spell out the organization's commitment to diversity . on the local and national-levels , opportunities for professional-development will grow and all staff-members in a program , not just attorneys , take advantage of them . encouraging discrimination-based-advocacy discrimination-based-advocacy is incorporated in advocate orientation and training-sessions . it also becomes a focus at national-training-events . state-planning addresses discrimination-based-advocacy and the infrastructure necessary to achieve it . programs and state-justice-communities seek guidance on the intersection of race and poverty from national-experts and focus on these issues in local , regional and state-contexts . programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory-impact on clients that can result from public policies . they hire individuals to act as leaders , teachers and resources in this arena . training strategies highlight the centrality of discrimination-based-advocacy to our mission . developing a common-definition and vision of diversity a common-definition of diversity is developed . it is informed by federal and state-law , census-data and innovative-models from other disciplines while acknowledging the breadth of our communities . it incorporates concepts of power and reduction of barriers and an affirmative-duty to address barriers . program and justice-community success is tied to and evaluated in terms of diversity-initiatives . all programs commit to addressing internal-diversity-concerns . addressing `` loss of trust '' due to perception that programs are no longer dealing with discrimination-based-issues state-justice-communities begin to examine how they set priorities given changing-demographics ( census ) , new technology , emerging legal-needs , commonalties among diverse-communities , and severely marginalized-client-populations living within in our service-areas . programs create staff-positions charged with working with special-client-populations . programs and their staff-members are encouraged to collaborate with the community and apply bold strategies in addressing-community-problems . state-justice-communities examine leadership within a multicultural-framework and use the results in staff and leadership-training . they become more creative in raising-funds for discrimination-based-projects . ensuring that justice-communities become diverse , inclusive , and multiculturally-competent and creating-cultures that impact a broader range of legal-issues than we do now ( i.e. , mental-health and racial-justice ) national-organizations publicly affirm that a hallmark of the justice-community is that it is diverse , inclusive , and multiculturally-competent . a `` best-practices '' clearinghouse is developed where programs share ideas on diversity-successes . there are regular-diversity-conferences for state-justice-community leaders .
