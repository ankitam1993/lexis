tallahassee democrat attorney gives of his time generously for the public-good by james l. rosica thursday , december 12 , 2002 for the past 20 years , attorney richard m. smith has helped senior-citizens with their legal-needs , free of charge . but smith , like many volunteers , does n't want any accolades . `` i 'm no saint , '' the 80-year-old tallahasseean said . `` i 'm just a country-lawyer . '' his assistant , attorney twyla sketchley , sat behind his shoulder and silently mouthed , `` he is a saint . '' every month , smith visits the smith williams center in the bond community and the wakulla county senior-citizens council building in crawfordville to advise seniors on wills , power of attorney and other legal-matters . smith practiced-law for a living until 1982 . since then , he's been semi-retired , devoting himself to helping fellow-seniors who are needy . `` i 'm getting unable to do much physically , but my brain hasn't quit , '' said smith , who walks with a cane . `` and i 'd rather-people ask a foolish-question now than have them make a dumb-mistake later . '' smith and sketchley helped beatrice jackson at the smith williams center on wednesday . jackson , who said she was `` over 60 , '' needed-help with estate-planning . `` he 's not through with me yet ... but he 's done a real-good job , '' said jackson , a retired-state-worker . over the years , smith said , he 's helped-clients with not only wills but also adoptions , divorces and even animal-control-cases . `` someone 's cat was bit by a dog , as i recall , '' he said . smith coordinates his volunteer lawyering through legal-services of north florida , a nonprofit-organization serving-low-income families and individuals . `` he 's such a fine , fine-person , '' said executive director kris knab . without him , `` there would be a huge ( number ) of people who would go without assistance . ... we 're so impressed with his dedication and commitment . '' also impressed is his cousin , chesterfield smith , former-president of the american bar-association and chairman-emeritus of the state 's powerful holland & knight law firm . `` i 'm real proud of him , '' said smith , 85 , who went to the university of florida 's law-school at the same time as richard . `` even then , he would worry about pro-bono-work and has done it most of his life .
