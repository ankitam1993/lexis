office of the general counsel b-278894 january 15 , 1998 the honorable william v. roth , jr. chairman the honorable daniel patrick moynihan ranking minority member committee on finance united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives the honorable william f. goodling chairman the honorable william l. clay ranking minority member committee on education and the workforce house of representatives the honorable bill archer chairman the honorable charles b. rangel ranking minority member committee on ways and means house of representatives subject : department of the treasury , internal revenue service ; department of labor , pension and welfare-benefits administration ; department of health and human-services , health care financing administration : interim-rules for mental-health parity pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a group of rules which constitute major-rules promulgated by the department of the gao/ogc-98-22 treasury , internal revenue service ; department of labor , pension and welfare-benefits administration ; and the department of health and human-services , health care financing administration ; entitled '' interim-rules for mental-health parity '' ( rin : 1545-av53 ; 1210-aa62 ; 0938-ai05 ) . we received the rules from the department of the treasury on december 22 , 1997 , the department of labor on december 30 , 1997 , and the department of health and human-services on january 2 , 1998 . they were published in the federal register as interim-rules on december 22 , 1997 . 62 fed . reg . 66932 . the interim-rules govern parity between medical/surgical benefits and mental-health-benefits in group-health-plans and health-insurance-coverage offered by issuers in connection with a group-health-plan . the rules implement changes made to the internal revenue-code of 1986 , the employee retirement-income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) , and the public health service act ( phs act ) contained in the mental-health parity act of 1996 ( mhpa ) and the taxpayer relief act of 1997 . we note that the interim-rules have a listed effective-date of january 1 , 1998 , which is less than the 60-day delay in the effective-date required by the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996 ( sbrefa ) . the agencies have cited the `` good-cause '' exception to the 60-day delay requirement contained in section 808 ( 2 ) . section 808 ( 2 ) states that , notwithstanding section 801 , `` any rule which an agency for good-cause finds ( and incorporates the finding and a brief-statement of reasons-therefor in the rule issued ) that notice and public procedure-thereon are impracticable , unnecessary , or contrary to the public-interest '' shall take effect at such time as the federal-agency promulgating the rule determines . the agencies took this action in order to have rules in place when the statutorily mandated effective-date occurs . also , the agencies invoked the similarly worded `` good-cause '' exception contained in the administrative procedure act ( apa ) at section 553 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( b ) , which allows an agency to forego issuing a notice of proposed-rulemaking and receiving public-comments . in the past , we have concluded that the exception to the 60-day delay contained in section 808 ( 2 ) can not be used when a notice of proposed-rulemaking and a public-comment-period are used in conformance with the provisions of the apa . see department of health and human-services , health care financing administration : medicare program , b-275549 ; b-275552 , december 9 , 1996 , gao/ogc-97-9 . while in this case there was no notice of proposed-rulemaking , we note that the mental-health parity act of 1996 was enacted in september 1996 and the agencies requested-comments on the legislation in july 1997 , 10 months after enactment . based on these time-periods alone , it appears likely that the agencies could have obtained comments earlier and issued the interim-rules in time to permit sbrefa 's 60-day delay period for congressional review . page 2 gao/ogc-98-22 enclosed is our assessment of the agencies ' compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the agencies , except as noted above , complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact james vickers , assistant general counsel , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to subject of the interim-rule is william scanlon , director , health financing and systems issues . mr. scanlon can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-7114 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : the honorable olena berg assistant secretary for pension and welfare-benefits department of labor ms. cynthia grigsby chief , regulations unit internal revenue service department of the treasury the honorable donna e. shalala the secretary of health and human-services page 3 gao/ogc-98-22 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the department of the treasury , internal revenue service ; the department of labor , pension and welfare-benefits administration ; and the department of health and human-services , health care financing administration entitled `` interim-rules for mental-health parity '' ( rin : 1545-av53 ; 1210-aa62 ; 0938-ai05 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the departments of labor and health and human-services performed an economic-impact-analysis on the effects of the interim-rules . utilizing-figures from the congressional budget office , it is estimated that the total annual direct-impact of the mhpa would be to increase aggregate health plan expenditures by $ 1.16 billion , not accounting for plan-sponsor-responses to reduce that impact . considering those responses , the actual-increase in annual aggregate health plan expenditures would be $ 464 million . the preamble to the interim-rules contains a further discussion of additional-analyses considered and performed by the departments , including an analysis prepared by coopers and lybrand . the analyses utilized different-assumptions and generally resulted in smaller expenditure-impact-estimates than noted above . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 , and 609 since these rules are being issued as interim-rules and were not previously published through a notice of proposed-rulemaking , the departments were not required to prepare an initial or final regulatory-flexibility-analysis under the act . however , the departments point out in the preamble to the interim-rules that many of the issues which would have been considered in such analyses were , in fact , considered . the issues are discussed in the regulatory-impact-analysis . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 since the rules were issued as interim-rules and not as general-notices of proposed-rulemaking , they are not subject to the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 . however , the departments indicate that the rules have been designed to be the least gao/ogc-98-22 burdensome-alternative on state , local , and tribal-governments and the private sector . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . these rules were adopted on an interim-basis because the secretaries determined that the publication of a proposed regulation , for the purpose of notice and public-comment , would be impracticable , unnecessary , and contrary to the public-interest . the secretaries found that the requirements are effective january 1 , 1998 , under the provisions of the mhpa and that plan administrators and sponsors , issuers , and participants needed guidance on the new statutory-provisions before the effective-date . however , comments on the statutory-provisions were solicited from the public by publication in the federal register on june 26 , 1997 ( 62 fed . reg . 34604 ) , and these comments were considered in formulating the interim-rules . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the interim-rules contain information-collections-subject to review and approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) under the paperwork reduction act . the departments have each submitted information-collection requests to omb and , according to the preamble , the departments of the treasury and labor have requested emergency-approval by omb . the information-collections-concern the notice to participants , beneficiaries , and the federal government of the ( 1 ) election of the 1-percent increased cost-exemption , ( 2 ) calculations and disclosure of documentation of eligibility for the exemption , and ( 3 ) notice of a group-health-plan 's use of a transition-period . the preamble to the interim-rules contain the information required by the paperwork reduction act including the need for the information , the parties affected , and the burden-estimates related to the collections by each department . statutory-authorization for the rule the department of the treasury 's rule is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in sections 7805 and 9833 of the internal revenue-code ( 26 u.s.c . §§ 7805 and 9833 ) , as amended by hipaa ( pub . l. 104-191 , 110 stat . 1936 ) , and the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( pub . l. 105-34 , 111 stat . 788 ) . page 2 gao/ogc-98-22 the department of labor 's rule is adopted pursuant to sections 107 , 209 , 505 , 701703 , 711 , 712 , and 731-734 of erisa ( 29 u.s.c . §§ 1027 , 1059 , 1135 , 1171-1173 , 1181 , 1182 , and 1191-1194 ) , as amended by hipaa , and mhpa ( pub . l. 104 , 110 stat . 2944 ) , and secretary of labor 's order no . 1-87 , 52 fed . reg . 13139 , april 21 , 1987 . the department of health and human-services ' rule is adopted pursuant to sections 2701 , 2702 , 2705 , 2711 , 2712 , 2713 , 2721 , 2722 , 2723 , and 2792 of the phs act ( 42 u.s.c . §§ 300gg , 300gg-1 , 300gg-5 , 300gg-11 , 300gg-12 , 300gg-13 , 300gg-21 , 300gg-22 , 300gg-23 , and 300gg-92 ) , as amended by hipaa and mhpa . executive-order no . 12866 the interim-rules were found to be `` economically-significant '' regulatory-actions by omb under executive-order no . 12866 . as such , they were reviewed by omb based on information supplied by the departments , which included planned regulatory-action-documents describing the reason for the rules and an assessment of the costs and budgetary-impact of the rules . page 3 gao/ogc-98-22
