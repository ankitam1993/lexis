twenty-five low-income-families saved from homelessness legal-services-attorneys negotiate agreement with city of east wenatchee east wenatchee - after more than a year of effort , attorneys with northwest justice project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile-home-park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction . the east wenatchee city council has entered into an interlocal agreement with the wenatchee housing authority authorizing the authority to purchase and maintain the mobile park plaza mobile-home-park . located just north of the wenatchee valley mall , the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year . `` we can not say enough about how relieved we are that this is over , '' said manuel luna , one of the residents of mobile park plaza . `` we were afraid that no solution would be found , and that our families would have no place to go . we are very grateful for the help of our attorneys . without them , we would not have saved our homes . we are also thankful for the help of the housing authority , the city council and mayor steve lacy . '' formerly owned by local-businessman dan jennings , mobile park plaza had been home to 45 low-income-families , many of them latino farm-workers . in october 2000 jennings gave the park-residents notice of his intent to close the park effective november 30 , 2001 . while some park-residents decided to move , others , including 25 families , organized an informal-association to relocate or save their homes . unable to afford private legal-counsel , the families asked for help from legal-services-attorneys at the northwest justice project and columbia legal-services . in the succeeding-months , these attorneys worked with representatives of the greater wenatchee housing authority , the state-office of community-development , chelan county , the city of east wenatchee , state-legislators , jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution . `` there seemed to be a never-ending-set of obstacles , '' said patrick pleas , an attorney with northwest justice project . `` mr. jennings had financial-considerations , the city had growth and economic-development-considerations , and the state and housing authority had their own concerns . thankfully , hard-work and good-will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone . '' northwest justice project and columbia legal-services are non-profit-organizations that provide civil legal-assistance to low-income-individuals and families throughout washington state . members of the state 's access to justice-network , these organizations work with thousands of volunteer-attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal-problems and ca n't afford private legal-counsel . services such as those provided to the residents of mobile park plaza now hang in the balance , in light of governor gary locke's recent-cutting of $ 2.4 million in annual-state-funding for civil legal-services - nearly-half of the state 's yearly-contribution to legal-services-programs statewide .
