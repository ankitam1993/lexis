the daily-record towson attorney designs project to benefit legal-aid earl kelly friday , december 6 , 2002 lawyer eliot m. wagonheim of towson has designed a project that will benefit two baltimore county law-related-organizations and establish a fund for helping-area-firefighters who become disabled . wagonheim said the program not only will benefit the needy , but also will help improve the public-image of lawyers . `` it not only raises money for charity , '' he said , `` but gives people-something else to think about the next time they hear a lawyer-joke . '' called take 2 , the endeavor will be funded by attorneys who donate either 2 percent of their earnings or $ 2 for each billable-hour charged on thursdays in march 2003 . as for attorneys who handle contingency-cases or who are salaried , wagonheim said they could participate by donating some amount that approximated such a donation . donors may earmark contributions to go to the legal-aid bureau for use in baltimore county , to charitable-programs run by the baltimore county bar-foundation , or to benefit families of firefighters and rescue-workers who are killed or injured . wagonheim said he initially hoped to recruit about 300 contributors for take 2 's first year , and projected-donations of upwards of $ 15,000 . after contacting-attorneys about take 2 , wagonheim is beginning to revise his projections . `` the response has led me to believe its going to be much higher than that , '' wagonheim said . `` i ca n't tell you how excited i am by it . '' focal-point wagonheim has experience in creating charitable-endeavors . he was one of the organizers of the now-famous chesapeake blues festival , an event held each year since 1998 at sandy point state park outside annapolis for the benefit of several-charities . but wagonheim eschewed the publicity . `` i really hope the focus wo n't be on me doing charity-work but will be on take 2 , '' said wagonheim , who added that baltimore county-bar-association president stephen j. nolan was instrumental in launching the new program . nolan said of take 2 , `` lawyers individually are doing a lot for the community , and this is one way we can channel our efforts . '' wilhelm h. joseph jr. , executive director of the legal-aid bureau , which helps fund legal-services for the poor in civil-matters , said that take 2 `` is not charity . it 's about the professional-responsibility of each individual-lawyer and the bar-association . '' the take 2 initiative will reach well beyond the legal-profession and serve members of the broader community . baltimore county-firefighters do not have a formal-program to provide a financial-boost to firefighters and paramedics who are injured and unable to work . this shortcoming became evident following terrorist attacks on the world-trade center in new york city , where firefighters have such a fund that helps members ' families in times of need . `` let 's say a baltimore county-firefighter is from north county and they are injured and are in the shock-trauma-unit in baltimore but a family-member ca n't-commute from the pennsylvania line , '' wagonheim said . `` right now , the firefighters will pass the hat and help raise money to put the family up , but there is no fund . '' firefighter michael r. rehfeld , a ladder-truck-driver and 17-year veteran of the force , was working to create such a fund , and wagonheim heard of his efforts . rehfeld , reached yesterday between emergency-runs caused by the heavy-snowfall , said critically injured firefighters and rescue-workers often must hire others , such as plumbers and yard-workers , to help maintain their homes during periods of convalescence . `` we saw what happened up in new york and how much-critical need there was to establish this , '' rehfeld said . `` take 2 is the starting point , and we hope to establish an endowment . '' wagonheim , who teaches the professionalism-course for the maryland state-bar-association , said he is working with the msba to create a statewide take 2-type program . attorneys who want to participate in take 2 may call the baltimore county-bar-association at 410-337-9103 or contact the association at www.bcba.org or wagonheim at www.wtlawfirm.com .
