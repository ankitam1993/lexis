statements of federal financial-accounting-concepts and standards as of february 28 , 1997 sffac nos . 1-2 sffas nos . 1-8 selected materials gao document # foreword this volume is the first of a two volume set referred to as the '' codification . '' it contains the original-text that currently constitutes the body of accounting-concepts and standards for the u.s. government . specifically , the volume incorporates the following-documents published through february 28 , 1997 : -- statements of federal financial-accounting-concepts 1 & 2 , and -- statements of federal financial-accounting-standards 1-8.1 origins of the statements the concepts and standards presented in the two volume set resulted from the joint-efforts of the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , the office of management and budget ( omb ) , and the general-accounting-office ( gao ) . these three central-agencies , referred to collectively as the `` principals '' , established the federal-accounting-standards advisory-board ( fasab ) in 1990 . fasab was created to consider and recommend accounting-standards and principles.2 the principals ultimately decide upon the principles and standards . the codification includes only those principles and standards agreed to by the principals . fasab is publishing the codification as a comprehensive-basis of accounting for federal-reporting-entities . it is expected that fasab will continue to recommend statements on specialized topics . as new statements and interpretations are adopted , the codification will be updated . purpose of the codification the codification of federal-accounting concepts and standards is a two volume set with extensive-cross-referencing and indexing . the volumes are designed to meet the needs of users for references to original-statements ( volume i ) and to standards alphabetized by topic ( volume ii ) . both volumes serve as authoritative-references to the standards and interpretations . 1 statement of federal financial-accounting-standards no . 8 , supplementary-stewardship reporting , has been approved by the board 's principals but may not be implemented until it has undergone a 45-day review by congress . the review was not completed at the time this volume was published . sffas no . 8 is provided herein for your convenience and future-use . an announcement will be made in the federal register when the review has been completed and sffas no . 8 can be implemented . 2 for a more extensive-description of fasab 's role , refer to statement of federal financial-accounting-concepts no . 1 , objectives of federal financial-reporting , paras . 23-29 . volume i this volume , volume 1 -- federal financial-accounting-concepts and standards-original-statements , is a compilation of the documents produced by the federal-accounting-standards advisory-board and adopted by the principals : the secretary of the treasury , the director of omb , and the comptroller general of the united states . once adopted , the documents are referred to as statements of federal financial-accounting-concepts ( sffac or concepts ) and statements of federal financial-accounting-standards ( sffas or standards ) respectively . this volume presents the concepts in their entirety . concepts do not establish federal financial-accounting-standards ; rather they describe the concepts used by fasab as a framework as it considers and recommends accounting-principles for the federal government . concepts are meant to guide others involved in federal financial-reporting such as preparers and auditors . this volume extracts the authoritative-portions of the standards originally published in individual-statements as well as the explanatory-text contained in any appendices . it does not reprint the summaries or all introductory and background-material since these sections are not always-essential to applying the standards or understanding the board 's conclusions . the basis for the board's conclusions for each standard is included since it serves to explain the specific-provisions of the standards . the glossaries originally published with each statement have been codified in a single-glossary . this glossary is presented as the last-appendix to the volume . volume ii volume ii of this set , a user 's guide to federal financial-accounting-standards , is a codification of the standards . volume ii presents the standards alphabetized by topic , pulls together all references to a particular-topic in one section , and integrates illustrative-material from both the sffass and the original exposures drafts wherever possible . applicability the mission of fasab is to recommend accounting-concepts and standards that result in federal-agencies ' financial-reports including understandable , relevant , and reliable-information about the financial position , activities , and results of operations of the united states government and its component-units . in addition , the standards should foster the improvement of accounting-systems and internal-controls that will help provide reasonable-assurance to users that government-activities have been conducted economically , efficiently , and effectively , and in compliance with applicable-laws and regulations . therefore , fasab believes that federal financial-accounting-concepts and standards should be considered in establishing-systems and in maintaining-day-to-day financial-records as well as being applied to general-purpose financial-reports of u. s. government-reporting-entities . this belief is consistent with the requirements of the federal financial-management-improvement act of 1996 which states that `` each agency shall implement and maintain financial-management-systems that comply substantially with federal financial-management-systems requirements , applicable federal-accounting-standards , and the united states government standard general-ledger at the transaction-level . `` 3 the specific-applicability of the standards to components of the federal government was considered during the development of statement of federal financial-accounting-concepts no . 2 ( sffac no . 2 ) , entity and display . sffac no . 2-lists-criteria for including-components in federal-reporting-entities ( see pp . 75-77 ) and provides the following-guidance with regard to components required by law or policy to issue financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting-standards other than those constituting federal gaap . for example , some components are required to apply accounting-standards issued by the financial-accounting-standards board or a regulatory-agency . those components should continue to apply the standards required by law or policy for their financial statements . the reporting-entities of which the components are a part , however , need to be sensitive to differences that may arise from the different-accounting-standards . if these differences are material , the standards constituting federal gaap should be applied for purposes of including the components in entity-wide-statements . in such cases , the components may need to provide additional disclosures or different-measurements required to comply with federal gaap . the standards need not be applied to immaterial-items . hierarchy of federal generally accepted accounting-principles the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting-principles4 ( gaap ) governs what constitutes gaap for all u.s. government-reporting-entities . omb publishes the hierarchy in its bulletin entitled form and content of agency financial statements . it lists the priority-sequence of sources that an entity should look to for accounting and reporting-guidance . 3title viii -- federal financial-management-improvement act of 1996 , sec . 803 ( a ) . 4 '' accounting-principles '' are those conventions , rules , and procedures necessary to define acceptable-accounting-practice at a particular-time . in 1996 , through the joint-efforts of the treasury , omb , and gao , a body of generally accepted accounting-principles ( gaap ) covering most transactions was promulgated for the federal government . however , agencies may engage in transactions that are not addressed by these standards . in that event , agencies should view the hierarchy as providing-sources of gaap for the federal government . while many of the standards comprising federal gaap have already been made effective , three of those standards will not be effective until fiscal year 1998 . the following-hierarchy5 determines gaap for u.s. government-reporting-entities beginning in fiscal year 1998 : 1 . individual-standards agreed to by the director of omb , the comptroller general , and the secretary of the treasury and published by omb and the general-accounting-office . 2 . interpretations related to the sffass issued by omb in accordance with the procedures outlined in omb circular a-134 , financial-accounting principles and standards . 3 . requirements contained in omb 's form and content bulletin in effect for the period covered by the financial statements . 4 . accounting-principles published by authoritative-standard setting-bodies and other authoritative-sources ( a ) in the absence of other guidance in the first three parts of this hierarchy , and ( b ) if the use of such accounting-principles improves the meaningfulness of the financial statements . the above hierarchy may be implemented earlier than fiscal year 1998 with approval from omb . until the above hierarchy is effective , u.s. government-reporting-entities will continue to follow the hierarchy-established6 for an `` other comprehensive-basis of accounting '' ( ocboa ) and presented below : 1 . individual-statements agreed to and published by the jfmip principals . 2 . form and content-requirements included in omb bulletin 93-02 , dated october 22 , 1992 , and

authoritative-standard setting-bodies and other authoritative-sources ( 1 ) in the absence of other guidance in the first three parts of this hierarchy , and ( 2 ) if the use of such accounting-standards improve the meaningfulness of the financial statements . source for interpretations omb circular a-134 describes the policies for seeking and providing-interpretations and other advice related to the standards . an interpretation is a document of narrow-scope that provides clarifications of original-meaning , additional definitions , or other guidance pertaining to an existing sffas . requests for interpretations should be directed to omb 's office of federal financial-management or to the executive director , fasab . omb and fasab will respond to the request for guidance by providing technical-assistance unless they determine that the response should be an interpretation . in that event , fasab staff will provide written copies of the request to the board members . fasab staff will examine , as appropriate , applicable-literature and consult with knowledgeable-persons and draft an interpretation of federal financial-accounting-standards . fasab will consider the draft-interpretation at an open-meeting . after a majority agrees and the representatives of the three principals ( treasury , gao , and omb ) approve and sign the interpretation ; the interpretation will be published by omb and gao . organization of the codification volume i presents the text of the original-statements as described above . each statement is presented as a separate-chapter . the issue-date and effective-date of each statement are presented first . next , references to relevant-sections within volume i and to volume ii are provided . any interpretations that relate to the statements are also identified . in some cases , the statements have been affected by later statements or affect earlier statements . references direct the reader to the affected-paragraphs and indicate the source of the change . within the text of the statements , provisions deleted as a result of other statements are marked with strikeouts and provisions affected by other statements are doubleunderlined . double-underlined-text remains as originally published . the double-underlining is intended to alert the reader to the fact that it has been modified or affected by a later-statement . a brief-summary of the statement is presented . a table of contents referenced to both page and paragraph-numbers follows the summary . note that the paragraph-numbers are those originally expressed in the individual-statements despite the omission of some paragraphs . any omitted-paragraphs are indicated in the table of contents . volume i also presents the following-appendices : volume ii is under development at this time and will be organized alphabetically by topic . topics will be specific financial-statement-items . each topical-section will be identified by an alpha-numeric-code ( for example , p10 for `` pensions '' ) , with numbers selected to allow addition of future-topics . paragraphs within each section will be numbered consecutively . the following-numeric-format has been proposed : paragraphs .100 - .599 : standards and potential-note-disclosures paragraphs .600 - .699 : interpretations published by omb paragraphs .700 - .799 : nonauthoritative discussion & illustrations source-references will be provided in paragraphs .100 - .599 to indicate the original-statement from which material was drawn . the references will appear in brackets at the end of each paragraph or illustration . for example , the reference [ sffas 7 , para . 81 ] refers to statement of federal financial-accounting-standards no . 7 , accounting for revenue and other financing-sources and concepts for reconciling budgetary and financial-accounting , paragraph 81 . source-references will be provided in the nonauthoritative paragraphs as footnotes to permit more descriptive-identification of the sources . volume ii will present the following-appendices and may present others : -- topical-index -- fasab active and future-projects -- topics not yet addressed -- consolidated glossary table of contents page transactions with the public nonexchange-transactions with the public 242 . individual-income-taxes , corporation-income-taxes , social-insurance-taxes and contributions,37 excise-taxes , estate and gift-taxes , and customs duties. -- taxes ( including-customs-duties ) are levied through the exercise of the power of the government to compel payment . in broad-terms , taxes are `` the price we pay for civilization . '' more specifically they finance spending of many types to promote the general-welfare , provide for the common defense , and ensure domestic-tranquillity : national-defense , a judicial-system , aid to the elderly , construction of infrastructure , education and training , and so forth . the relationship between the tax paid and the value received is too indirect and disproportionate to relate the revenue that is received from any identifiable-taxpayer to the cost that is incurred for providing that identifiable-taxpayer with benefits . this is especially the case where the benefits are of a collective or public-nature , such as national-defense , in which case consumption by one taxpayer does not reduce the consumption available for another ; or where the benefits are designed to redistribute-income from one group of people to another . therefore , tax-revenue is nonexchange-revenue . 243 . all excise-taxes , like other taxes , are classified as resulting in nonexchange-revenue . some excise-taxes ( considered to be benefit taxes ) are levied on bases that are related to the use of publicly provided goods and services or the public-provision of other benefits , such as the gasoline-tax ; certain other excise-taxes are levied on bases related to a cause of some damage and are dedicated to pay down costs , such as the tax on domestically mined coal , which is dedicated to the black lung disability trust-fund . even in these cases , however , the relationship between the tax and the benefit received by an identifiable-recipient is relatively indirect and disproportionate . moreover , these excise-taxes , like other taxes , are determined through the exercise of the power of the government to compel payment . therefore , like other taxes , they are classified as producing nonexchange-revenue . 244 . board members have differing-views on whether social-insurance-programs result in exchange or nonexchange transactions.38 however , they agree that social-insurance-tax revenue should be reported in the same way as other tax-revenue for the purposes of financial-reporting . this is because social-insurance-taxes , like other taxes , are determined through the exercise of the power of the government to compel payment . furthermore , individuals and businesses subject to social-insurance-taxes are subject to them as a byproduct of their decision to enter covered employment or engage in a covered business , so especially for the major , broad-based social-insurance-programs -- social-security , medicare ( hospital-insurance ) , and unemployment 37 '' social-insurance '' does not include programs established solely or primarily for federal-employees , such as pension and other retirement-plans . `` social-insurance '' taxes and contributions do , however , include payments made by or on behalf of federal-employees to social-insurance-plans , such as social-security and medicare . 38see-discussion of social-insurance-programs in fasab , exposure-draft , supplementary-stewardship reporting ( august 1995 ) . compensation -- they have virtually no legal-option except to pay . 245 . tax-receipts are generally collected from the public by the irs ( internal revenue service ) and , to a lesser extent , by the customs service and other entities acting as agents for the recipient-entities rather than on their own behalf . the collecting-entity receives the cash and then transfers it to the general-fund , trust-fund , or special-fund on whose behalf it was collected . the amount so collected should be accounted for as a custodial-activity by the collecting-entity . the tax is recognized as a nonexchange-revenue by the entity that is legally entitled to the amount . this would be a trust-fund or special-fund in the case of an earmarked ( i.e. , dedicated ) tax . if collected on behalf of the government as a whole , it would be recognized in the government-wide consolidated financial statements . 246 . social-insurance-taxes and contributions paid by federal employees.39 -- federal-employees may be covered by social-insurance-programs such as social security40 and medicare under the same terms and conditions as the remainder of the covered population . the payments made by federal-employees are in the nature of taxes , compulsory-payments demanded by the government through the exercise of its power to compel payment . insofar as the social-insurance-program applies to employees of the united states government , the terms and conditions are generally the same as the program for private-employees . the employer and employee-contributions are generally calculated in the same way ; the employee-contribution is not earned by the social-insurance-program ; and the benefits are generally calculated in the same way . the employee does not obtain particular-benefits under the plan from rendering-service in federal-employment , because he or she would have been similarly covered by the program if privately employed and would have obtained similar-benefits . for these reasons , the employee-contribution should have the same classification as contributions by non-federal-employees , which is nonexchange-revenue . 247 . deposits by states for unemployment-trust fund. -- states deposit the receipts from the state-unemployment-tax to the u.s. treasury for the unemployment-trust-fund in order to finance most of the benefits under the unemployment-compensation-system . the state-unemployment-tax differs from state to state in terms of the tax rate , tax-base , and certain other characteristics , and unemployment-benefits also differ from state to state . nevertheless , the deposit has long been construed as a federal-budget receipt ( a governmental-receipt ) , and the unemployment-trust-fund has long been included as an account in the federal-budget . 248 . this is for a combination of reasons taken together : ( a ) the unemployment-compensation-system -- including the system of taxes , the system of benefits , and the trust-fund -- was established by the social-security act of 1935 and has been amended by federal law many times ; ( b ) deposits are held in a trust-fund operated by the u.s. government ; ( c ) federal law specifies extensive requirements for the state-unemployment-tax and unemployment-benefits ; ( d ) the federal-unemployment-tax finances grants to states to cover their entire-cost of administering the unemployment 39 social-insurance '' does not include programs established solely or primarily for federal-employees , such as pension and other retirement-plans . 40 most federal civilian-employees hired before 1984 are not covered by social-security . system ; and ( e ) federal law effectively coerces states to participate in the system , with participation requiring them to levy the state-unemployment-tax and deposit the collections in the u.s. treasury . if a state does not participate ( or is not certified by the department of labor as meeting federal-requirements ) : ( i ) the federal-unemployment-tax is levied within the state at its maximum-rate , ( ii ) the system does not pay any unemployment-compensation benefits within the state , and ( iii ) the federal government provides no grants to state-governments to pay for the costs of administration . the deposits of the state-tax are therefore-nonexchange revenue of the unemployment-trust-fund . ( the federal-unemployment-tax is levied and collected separately from the state-unemployment-tax . ) 249 . user-fees , harbor maintenance trust-fund . -- this is an example of a tax that is termed a `` user-fee '' by law while classified in the budget as a governmental-receipt together with other taxes and duties . it is an ad valorem-tax of 0.125 percent imposed on commercial-cargo loaded and unloaded at specified u.s. ports open to public-navigation . the receipt is earmarked to the harbor maintenance trust-fund . it is similar in nature to other excise-taxes that result from the government 's power to compel payment and that are dedicated to a trust-fund or special-fund to be spent for a designated purpose ( for example , the gasoline-excise tax , which is dedicated to the highway trust-fund ) . it therefore should be recognized as nonexchange-revenue by the harbor maintenance trust-fund . 250 . customs service fees. -- the customs service collects revenue primarily from duties on imported-merchandise but also from two types of fees : the merchandise-processing-fee and a group of fees called `` user-fees . '' 251 . the merchandise-processing-fee is primarily an ad valorem charge on formal-merchandise-entries into the united states ( at 0.19 percent ) subject to a maximum and minimum-charge . it also includes flat-fees on informally entered goods . the collections are earmarked by law to a special-fund from which receipts are made available to finance customs service-operations to the extent provided by current-appropriations . 252 . the merchandise-processing-fee is associated with the cost of the customs service 's operations . the fee as originally enacted was modified by the customs and trade act of 1990 to make it consistent with u.s. obligations under gatt ( the general-agreement on tariffs and trade ) after a gatt panel had ruled that the original-fee ( a straight ad valorem fee ) exceeded the cost of services rendered and was a tax on imports that discriminated against imports in favor of domestic-production . the maximum and minimum-fees and the flat-fees were enacted to meet the u.s. obligation . 253 . however , the associated cost is primarily some of the costs of assessing and collecting-duties on imported-merchandise , such as the salaries of import-specialists ( who classify merchandise ) and the costs of processing-paperwork . the importer pays duties that are required by law ; it does not receive anything of value from the government in the nature of an exchange . furthermore , these costs are not likely to depend significantly on the value of the merchandise , and the fee is levied through the power of the government to compel payment . therefore , for the purpose of a classification-system for financial-reporting , the fee is akin to dedicated-taxes that are also related in the aggregate to associated costs and that are classified as nonexchange-revenue ( e.g. , the excise-tax on gasoline ) . the merchandise-processing-fee is therefore classified as a nonexchange-revenue . 254 . the user-fees consist of a group of flat-fees charged on passengers and conveyances entering the country.41 the collections are dedicated by law to a special-fund whose receipts are made available by permanent indefinite-appropriation to finance customs service-operations . 255 . these fees are intended to offset certain-inspection-costs that relate to the processing of passengers and conveyances entering the country . they are levied through the power of the government to compel payment , and the person or entity that pays these fees does not receive anything of value from the government in exchange . the inspection-activities are for a variety of purposes : to ensure that dutiable-merchandise is declared , to seize contraband ( such as narcotics and illegal-drugs ) , to detect infringements of patent and copyright laws , and so forth . some of these purposes are related to the government 's powers to raise taxes , which are nonexchange-revenue , and to enforce laws . only to a limited-extent are they like regulatory-user-fees , based on the government 's power to regulate particular-businesses or activities . therefore , like the merchandise-processing-fee , the user-fees are classified as nonexchange-revenue . 256 . deposits of earnings , federal reserve system. -- the federal reserve system consists of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and twelve regional federal reserve banks . under federal-accounting concepts , it is not considered to be part of the government-wide-reporting-entity . therefore , payments made to or collections received from the federal reserve system would be reported in the financial statements of the federal government and its component reporting entities.42 the federal reserve earns large amounts of interest on its portfolio of treasury-securities and deposits to the treasury all net income after deducting-dividends and the amount necessary to bring the surplus of the federal reserve banks to the level of capital-paid-in . 257 . the federal reserve was established by act of congress pursuant to the government 's sovereign-power over the nation's money , and its investment in treasury-securities is necessary for carrying out its monetary-function . it does not receive anything of value from the government in exchange for its deposit of earnings , and on occasion it has been required by law to make extra-payments . the revenue from the deposits is therefore-nonexchange . 258 . donations : except types of property , plant , and equipment that are expensed. -- donations are contributions to the government , i.e. , voluntary-gifts of resources to a government-entity by a non-federal entity.43 the government does not give anything of value to the donor , and the donor receives only personal-satisfaction . the donation 41these-fees are sometimes called the `` cobra user-fees . '' this term comes from the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 , which established these fees . 42sffac no . 2 , entity and display , para . 47 . 43 the term `` donations '' includes wills disposing of property and judicial-proceedings other than forfeitures . of cash , other financial-resources , or nonfinancial-resources ( except stewardship-property , plant , and equipment ) is therefore a nonexchange-revenue . 259 . the exception , stewardship pp & e , consists of federal-mission pp & e , heritage-assets , and stewardship-land . such pp & e is expensed if purchased , but no amount is recognized if it is received as a donation.44 correspondingly , no revenue is recognized for such donations . 260 . fines and penalties. -- fines and penalties are monetary requirements imposed on those who violate laws or administrative rules . the person or other entity that pays a fine or penalty does not receive anything of value in exchange , nor does the government sacrifice anything of value . the government collects these amounts through the exercise of its power to compel payment . fines and penalties are therefore a nonexchange-revenue . 261 . fines from judicial-proceedings are collected by the entity acting as an agent for the government as a whole rather than on its own behalf . they are therefore accounted for as a custodial-activity of the collecting-entity and recognized as a nonexchange-revenue in the government-wide consolidated financial statements . 262 . fines and penalties produced by an entity's operations -- such as inspections to ensure compliance with federal law and with regulations that are the responsibility of the entity ( e.g. , inspections by the office of surface mining ) or compliance with regulations for the conduct of a federal-program -- are recognized as nonexchange-revenue by whichever-entity is legally entitled by law to the revenue . in some cases , but not all , this would be the collecting-entity . if the collecting-entity-transfers the nonexchange-revenue to the general-fund or another entity , the amount is accounted for as a custodial-activity by the collecting-entity . if transferred to the general-fund , the penalties are recognized as nonexchange-revenue in the government-wide consolidated financial statements ; if transferred to another entity , they are recognized as nonexchange-revenue by the entity that receives the transfer . 263 . penalties due to delinquent-taxes in connection with custodial activity. -- the person or other private-entity that pays a penalty on delinquent-taxes does not receive anything in exchange , nor does the government sacrifice anything of value . the government collects these amounts through its power to compel payment . penalties on delinquent-taxes are therefore a nonexchange-revenue . the penalties are accounted for as a custodial-activity . if transferred to the general-fund , the penalties are recognized as nonexchange-revenue in the government-wide consolidated financial statements ; if transferred to another entity , they are recognized as nonexchange-revenue by the entity that receives the transfer . 264 . forfeitures. -- property may be seized as a consequence of various-laws and regulations and forfeited to the government . forfeited-property may be acquired through forfeiture-proceedings , be acquired to satisfy a tax-liability , or consist of unclaimed and abandoned merchandise . forfeited-property is principally managed by the asset forfeiture fund of the justice department and the treasury forfeiture fund of the treasury department . revenue is recognized from forfeited-property unless the property is distributed to state or local-law-enforcement agencies or foreign 44sffas no.6 , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , para . 61 and 71. governments or is received in satisfaction of a previously recognized revenue ( e.g. , accrued-tax-receivables ) .45 265 . the timing of revenue-recognition depends on how the property is forfeited and the nature of the property . in the case of unclaimed and abandoned merchandise , revenue is recognized in the amount of the sales-proceeds at the time the property is sold . in the case of property acquired through forfeiture-proceedings , the timing of recognition depends on the nature and disposition of the property . for monetary-instruments , the revenue is recognized at the time of obtaining forfeiture-judgment ; for property that is sold , at the time of sale ; and for property that is held for internal-use or transferred to another federal-agency , at the time of obtaining-approval to use the property internally or transfer it.46 266 . the method of measuring-revenue depends on the nature of the property . the amount of revenue recognized for monetary-instruments is the market value when the forfeiture-judgment is obtained . for property that is sold , it is the sales-proceeds . for property that is held for internal-use or transferred to another federal-agency , it is the fair value of the property less a valuation-allowance for any liens or third-party-claims . 267 . the revenue from forfeiture is nonexchange-revenue , because the government seizes the property through the exercise of its power . the government does not sacrifice anything of value in exchange and the entity that forfeits the property does not receive anything of value . more than half of the forfeiture-revenue of the two funds mentioned above is from currency and other monetary-instruments . although other types of forfeited-property must be sold in order to recognize revenue , or constructively sold ( if transferred to another federal-agency or placed into internal-use ) , this is the last-step in a process that is inherently nonexchange . 268 . the disposition of the revenue from forfeiture is determined by law . revenue or the property itself may ultimately be distributed to the seizing-entity , state or local-law-enforcement agencies , foreign-governments , or the general-fund . revenue is recognized as nonexchange-revenue by the entity that is legally entitled to use the revenue or to use the property itself . if the property is distributed to a state or local-law-enforcement agency or a foreign-government , revenue is not recognized by a federal government-reporting-entity . if the revenue is transferred to the general-fund , it is recognized as nonexchange-revenue in the government-wide consolidated financial statements . 269 . some entities may be involved in the management and liquidation of forfeited-property but not themselves be entitled to the revenue or to the use of the property . for example , a central fund created to support the seizure-activities of multiple entities 45this amends sffas no . 3 , accounting for inventory and related-property , with respect to forfeitures related to satisfying-tax liabilities . 46 sffas no . 3 , para . 57-78 . the standard also requires deferred revenue to be recognized when a forfeiture-judgment is obtained , but the deferred revenue is reversed when revenue is recognized . the amount of revenue ordinarily differs from the amount of deferred revenue . in some cases , an adjustment subsequent to the original forfeiture-judgment may be necessary when it is later determined that a portion of the forfeiture is to be distributed to state or local-law-enforcement agencies or foreign-governments . may manage forfeited-property and the collection and disposition of the revenue from that property . these entities should account for the property as a custodial-activity . revenue is shown when it is recognized , and it is shown as transferred to others when the cash is disbursed or the property is delivered . the disposition of property to an entity outside the federal government is also accounted for . exchange-transactions with the public : revenue 270 . sales of goods and services. -- the cost of production for goods and services such as electricity , mail-delivery , and maps is defrayed in whole or in part by revenue from selling the goods or services provided . the sales may be made by a public-enterprise revolving-fund ( such as the bonneville power administration ) , an intragovernmental revolving-fund ( such as the government-printing office ) , or a fund that is not a revolving-fund ( such as the geological survey ) . each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . the sale is therefore an exchange-transaction , and the revenue is exchange-revenue for the entity making the sale . 271 . sales of goods and services in undercover operations. -- the cost of the government 's undercover-operations is defrayed in whole or in part from the proceeds of sales of goods that have been purchased ( as opposed to goods that have been forfeited ) . each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . these characteristics of the transaction are not affected by whether the sale is illegal . the sale is therefore an exchange-transactions , and the revenue is exchange-revenue of the entity making the sale . 272 . interest ( unless classified elsewhere ) , dividends , and rents ( except for mineral-rights ) on government property. -- each party receives and sacrifices-something of value , so the inflow of resources is an exchange-transaction . 273 . interest is classified as exchange-revenue notwithstanding the fact that the entity may not be charged a cost of capital for the assets that yield these inflows ; or , if the entity borrowed from treasury to acquire the assets , it may have been charged a below-market-interest-rate . the gross-cost of the entity is understated in such cases ; and to recognize an exchange-revenue is to recognize a revenue without some or all of the related-costs , and hence to understate the entity 's net-cost of operations . nevertheless , in some cases the entity does pay the treasury at least some interest ; and the government 's cost of borrowing to acquire the assets is recognized as a cost of the government as a whole . since some cost is recognized , even if not always the full-cost of the entity,47 an exchange-revenue is recognized for the entity that receives the inflow of interest . 274 . rents , royalties , and bonuses on outer continental shelf ( ocs ) and other petroleum and mineral rights. -- rents , royalties , and bonuses are exchange-revenues , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . the amounts are earned by sales in the market and therefore are exchange-revenue . they are collected by the minerals management service ( mms ) of the department of the interior , which 47 the partial-recognition of associated cost-distinguishes interest from rents , royalties , and bonuses on the outer continental shelf and the auction of the radio-spectrum . for the latter-transactions , see the subsequent-paragraphs . manages the energy and minerals-resources on the ocs and collects the amounts due the government and indian-tribes from minerals produced on the ocs and other federal and indian lands . 275 . mms does not recognize a depletion-cost for various reasons , including the fact that under present-accounting-standards natural-resources are not recognized as an asset and depletion is not recognized as a cost . as a result , this exchange-revenue-bears little-relationship to the recognized cost of mms and can not be matched against its gross-cost of operations . therefore , although the inflows are exchange-revenue , they should not be subtracted from mms 's gross-cost in determining its net-cost of operations . 276 . mms should instead account for the exchange-revenue as a custodial-activity . mms collects rents , royalties , and bonuses acting as an agent on behalf of the recipients designated by law : the general-fund , certain-entities within the government to which amounts are earmarked , the states , and indian-tribes and allottees . the amounts of revenue should be recognized and measured under the exchange-revenue-standards when they are due-pursuant to the contractual-agreement . 277 . the rents , royalties , and bonuses transferred to treasury for the general-fund , or to other government-reporting-entities , should be recognized by them as exchange-revenue . however , neither the government as a whole nor the other recipient-entities recognize the natural-resources as an asset and depletion as a cost . therefore , this exchange-revenue should not offset their gross-cost in determining their net-cost of operations . it should instead be a financing-source in determining their operating results and change in net-position . 278 . proceeds from the auction of the radio spectrum. -- the proceeds from auctioning the right to use the radio-spectrum are exchange-revenues , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . the amount of revenue is earned by sales in the market at auctions . it bears little-relationship to the costs recognized by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , which collects the revenue , or to the costs recognized by the u.s. government as a whole . therefore , it should not be offset against the costs of the fcc in determining its net-cost of operations or against the costs of the government as a whole in government-wide consolidated financial statements . 279 . the fcc should therefore account for this exchange-revenue as a custodial-activity , acting as an agent on behalf of the general-fund ; and it should be included as exchange-revenue in the government-wide consolidated financial statements . 280 . interest on post-199148 direct loans.49 -- interest on direct-loans is an exchange-transaction , because it is part of a broader exchange-transaction in which the entity makes a loan to the borrower and the entity and borrower each receives and sacrifices-something of value . interest on direct-loans that are budgeted according to the provisions of the federal credit reform act of 1990 consists of two components : the nominal-interest ( the stated-interest-rate times the nominal-principal ) and the amortized interest ( change in present-value of the loans receivable due to the passage of time ) . the combined-effect of these components equals the effective-interest , which is directly defined as the present-value of the loans receivable-times the treasury interest rate applicable to the particular-loans ( i.e. , the interest rate used to calculate the present-value of the direct-loans when the direct-loans were disbursed ) . the effective-interest causes an equal-increase in the aggregate-value of the assets on the balance sheet , and therefore the effective-interest is the amount recognized as exchange 50 revenue . 281 . interest on delinquent-taxes and other receivables that arise as the result of custodial operations. -- receivables that arise as the result of custodial-operations are custodial ( or non-entity ) assets , held by the irs or another entity as an agent for the government as a whole rather than on its own behalf ( e.g. , irs tax-receivables on which the delinquent-taxpayer must pay interest ) . the interest is an exchange-revenue , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value , but it is not related to the costs incurred by the collecting-entity . the interest is accounted for as a custodial-activity by the collecting-entity . if transferred to the general-fund , the interest is recognized as exchange-revenue in the government-wide consolidated financial statements because it is related to the government 's cost of borrowing ; if transferred to another entity , it is recognized as nonexchange-revenue by the entity that receives the transfer . 282 . regulatory-user-fees such as patent and copyright fees ; immigration and consular-fees ; sec registration and filing-fees ; and nuclear regulatory-commission fees. -- regulatory-user-fees are charges based on the government 's power to regulate particular-businesses or activities . the revenue is related to the cost in one of two ways . special-benefits may be provided to identifiable recipients who pay the fees , beyond the benefits , if any , that accrue to the general-public ( e.g. , passport-fees ) ; or the government may incur costs in order to regulate an identifiable entity for the benefit of the general-public or some other group , in which case the user-charge compensates the government for its regulatory-costs that were caused by the activity of the party that pays the charge ( e.g. , sec and nuclear regulatory-commission fees ) . 48 post-1991 direct-loans consist of direct-loans that were obligated after september 30 , 1991 , whereas pre-1992 direct-loans consist of direct-loans that were obligated before october 1 , 1991 . the same accounting that is used for post-1991 direct-loans is also used for pre-1992 direct-loans that were modified and transferred to financing-accounts ; loans receivable arising from defaulted post-1991 guaranteed-loans ; and loans receivable arising from defaulted pre-1992 guaranteed-loans that were modified and transferred to financing-accounts . 49 for interest on pre-1992 direct-loans , see the preceding-section on `` interest ( unless classified elsewhere ) . . . '' 50see sffas no . 2 , accounting for direct-loans and loan-guarantees , paragraphs 30-31 and 37 ; for an illustrative-case-study , also see appendix b . because in general the revenue is closely related to the cost of operations , these fees are classified as exchange-transactions and the revenue is an exchange-revenue of the entity that charges the fee . 283 . diversion-fees , department of justice. -- registrants in the diversion control program ( e.g. , physicians ) pay fees to the drug enforcement administration , in exchange for which the dea provides the registrants with the authority to prescribe controlled substances . the diversion-fees are intended to cover the costs of the diversion control program . because the revenue is related to the cost and the registrants both receive and sacrifice value , the payment of these fees is an exchange-revenue of the diversion control program . 284 . premiums for smi ( supplementary medical-insurance ) , bank-deposit-insurance , pension-benefit-guarantees , crop-insurance , life insurance , and other insurance. -- in exchange for a premium and other considerations , the government promises to make payments to program-participants if specified events occur . the premium-offsets the cost of the program in whole or in part . the degree to which participation is voluntary differs from program to program . because the revenue is related to the cost of the providing-service , it is an exchange-revenue of the insurance-program . 285 . federal-employee contributions to pension and other retirement-benefit plans.51 -- employees of the federal government provide service to their employer in exchange for compensation , of which some is received currently ( the salary ) and some is deferred ( pensions , retirement-health-benefits , and other retirement-benefits ) . this is an exchange-transaction , because each party-sacrifices-value and receives value in return . as part of this exchange-transaction , the government promises a pension to its employees after they retire . the government also promises other retirement-benefits , notably-health-benefits . in return , the employee provides services and , under some plans , makes a contribution to the retirement-fund out of his or her salary . the financing of these benefits may include contributions paid by the employee to the retirement-fund . 286 . in broad-terms , the employee-contribution is an inflow of resources to the retirement-fund as part of this exchange-transaction . more narrowly , it is a payment by the employee as part of an exchange of money and services for a future-pension or other retirement-benefit . therefore , it is an exchange-revenue of the entity that administers the retirement-plan and thus is an offset to that entity 's gross-cost in calculating its net-cost of operations.52 51federal employee retirement-plans do not include social-insurance , such as social-security and medicare . 52for further discussion of the accounting-standards for pensions and other retirement-benefits of federal-employees , see sffas no . 5 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government , para . 56-93 and 148-181 . the standards do not cover accounting for the plan per se as distinct from the administering-entity . nor do they cover defined contribution-plans , or administrative-entities that are not federal-reporting-entities . 287 . federal-employee contributions to health-benefits plan for current coverage. -- employees of the federal government provide services to their employer in exchange for compensation , of which some is received currently in the form of money ( the salary ) ; some is received currently in the form of payments to a third party ( the employer-entity-contribution to the medical-insurance-plan for current-coverage of its employees ) ; and some is deferred ( pensions and other retirement-benefits ) . this is an exchange-transaction , because each party-sacrifices-value and receives value in return . as part of this exchange-transaction , the government and its employees both contribute to a medical-insurance-plan that provides current-coverage of the employees . 288 . in broad-terms , the employee-contribution out of his or her salary is an inflow of resources to the health-benefits plan as part of this exchange-transaction . more narrowly , it is a payment in exchange for current-coverage by a health-benefits plan . therefore , it is an exchange-revenue of the entity that administers the health-benefits plan and thus is an offset to that entity's gross-cost in calculating its net-cost of operations . 289 . reimbursement for collecting revenue. -- the customs service collects duties on goods imported by puerto rico and the virgin islands . the customs service retains an amount equal to the estimated-cost of collecting these duties , including all costs of operations in puerto rico and the virgin islands and an allocation of overhead ; it transfers the remainder to the treasury , which , in turn , transfers the collections to puerto rico or the virgin islands . 290 . the total-amount of duties collected on these goods should be accounted for as a custodial-activity by the customs service . notwithstanding that duties are a nonexchange-revenue , these particular-duties are a nonexchange-revenue of an entity other than the united states and therefore are not recognized as a nonexchange-revenue of the u.s. government . 291 . the method of disposing of these collections combines two distinct-transactions into one . the entire-amount of the duties could be transferred to puerto rico and the virgin islands , and these governments could then pay the customs service to reimburse it for its services of collecting-duties . the payment to customs would be exchange-revenue of the customs service . the actual procedure for reimbursement , whereby customs retains an amount equal to the estimated-cost , is simpler but equivalent in substance . hence , the custodial-transfer to treasury ( for puerto rico and the virgin islands ) and the amount retained by customs should be shown as separate-components of the disposition of the revenue from customs-duties . the amount retained by customs to reimburse itself for its costs is exchange-revenue of the customs service and is offset against its gross-cost in calculating its net-cost of operations . 292 . reimbursement for cleanup costs. -- the coast guard or other federal-entities may incur costs to clean up environmental-hazards caused by private-parties and , in some cases , require these private-parties to reimburse it for the costs incurred . notwithstanding that the government-demands the revenue under its power to compel payment , the revenue arises from the action of the private-parties and is closely related to the cost of operations incurred as a result of that action . therefore , the revenue is an exchange-revenue of the entity that incurs the cost . exchange-transactions with the public : gains and losses 293 . note : as explained in the introduction to this appendix , transactions that are classified as producing-gains or losses should instead be classified as producing-revenue or expense if they are usual and recurring for a particular-reporting-entity . 294 . sales of government-assets : other than property , plant , and equipment and forfeited and foreclosed property. -- the sale of government-assets ( other than property , plant , and equipment and forfeited and foreclosed-property ) is an exchange-transaction , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . if the sales-price equals book value , there is no gain or loss , because a cash-inflow equal to book value is the exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore not a net-inflow of resources . if the sales-price is more or less than the book value of the property , a gain or loss , respectively , is recognized to the extent of the difference . the amount of the difference between sales-price and book value is ordinarily a gain or loss rather than a revenue or expense , because sales of property are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring-inflow of resources . 295 . sales of property , plant , and equipment. -- the transaction is an exchange-transaction , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . if the sales price53 equals book value , there is no gain or loss , because a cash-inflow equal to book value is the exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore not a net-inflow of resources . if the sales-price is more or less than book value , a gain or loss , respectively , is recognized to the extent of the difference . the amount of the difference is ordinarily a gain or loss rather than a revenue or an expense , because sales of property , plant , and equipment are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring-inflow of resources . 296 . the entire-sales-price is a gain if the book value of the asset is zero . the book value is zero ( a ) if the asset is general-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) that is fully depreciated or written-off or ( b ) if the asset is stewardship pp & e , for which the entire-cost is expensed when the asset is purchased.54 297 . acquisition of property , plant , and equipment through exchange. -- the cost of property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) acquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fair value of the pp & e surrendered at the time of exchange . if the fair value of the pp & e acquired is more readily-determinable than that of the pp & e surrendered , the cost is the fair value of the pp & e acquired . if neither fair value is determinable , the cost of the pp & e acquired is the cost recorded for the pp & e surrendered-net of any accumulated depreciation or amortization . in the event that cash-consideration is included in the exchange , the cost of pp & e acquired is increased ( or 53 the sales-price may include the fair value of items received in exchange . 54sffas no . 6 , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , has divided property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) into two basic-categories : general pp & e and stewardship pp & e ( which consists of federal-mission pp & e , heritage-assets , and stewardship-land ) . general pp & e is capitalized and recognized on the balance sheet ; stewardship pp & e is expensed and thus has no book value . ( stewardship pp & e is presented in a stewardship statement . ) decreased ) by the amount of the cash surrendered ( or received ) . 298 . any difference between the cost of the pp & e acquired and the book value of the pp & e surrendered is recognized as a gain or loss.55 it is a gain or loss rather than a revenue or expense , because ordinarily the amount would be an unusual or nonrecurring-inflow of resources . 299 . if the fair value of the pp & e acquired is less than the fair value of the pp & e surrendered , the pp & e acquired is recognized at its cost and subsequently reduced to its fair value . the difference between the cost of the pp & e acquired and its fair value is recognized as a loss.56 300 . sales of foreclosed-property : associated with pre-1992 direct-loans and loan guarantees. -- foreclosed-property associated with pre-1992 direct-loans and loan-guarantees is recognized as an asset at net realizable-value . the sale is an exchange-transaction , and any difference between the sales-proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss.57 301 . sales of receivables : except direct loans. -- the transaction is an exchange-transaction , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . upon sale , any difference between the sales-proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss . if the sales-price equals book value , there is no gain or loss , because the exchange of one asset for another of equal-value is not a net-inflow of resources . 302 . sales of direct loans. -- the sale of a direct-loan is a modification according to the federal credit reform act of 1990 , regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after fy 1991 or before fy 1992 . the book-value-loss ( or gain ) on a sale of direct-loans equals the book value of the loans sold ( prior to sale ) minus the net-proceeds of the sale . it normally differs from the cost of modification , which is recognized as an expense.58 any difference between the book-value-loss ( or gain ) and the cost of modification is recognized as a gain or loss.59 303 . retirement of debt-securities prior to maturity. -- debt-securities may be retired prior to maturity if they have a call feature or if they are eligible for redemption by the holder on demand . many treasury bonds issued before 1985 are callable ; savings-bonds , the government-account-series , the foreign-series , and the state and local-series 55see sffas no . 6 , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , para . 32 . 56ibid. , footnote 38 . 57see sffas no . 3 , accounting for inventory and related-property , para . 79-91 . 58 this difference is due to the different-interest-rates used to discount future-cash-flows for calculating the subsidy-cost ( and subsidy-allowance ) when the loan is made and for calculating the cost of modification at a later-time . if the sale is with recourse , the present-value of the estimated-loss from the recourse is also recognized as an expense . 59see sffas no . 2 , accounting for direct-loans and loan-guarantees , para . 53-55 and appendix b , part ii ( b ) . of treasury-securities are redeemable on demand , although sometimes with a penalty or other adjustment or only after a specified-period of time . 304 . each party receives and sacrifices-something of value in buying and selling-debt-securities that may be retired prior to maturity . the sales-price reflects such features . therefore , the transaction is an exchange-transaction . the difference , if any , between the reacquisition-price and the net carrying-value of the extinguished-debt is recognized as a loss or gain.60 other financing-sources from the public 305 . seigniorage. -- seigniorage is the face-value of newly minted coins less the cost of production ( which includes the cost of the metal , manufacturing , and transportation ) . it results from the sovereign-power of the government to directly create money and , although not an inflow of resources from the public , does increase the government 's net-position in the same manner as an inflow of resources . because it is not demanded , earned , or donated , it is an other financing-source rather than revenue . it should be recognized as an other financing-source when coins are delivered to the federal reserve banks in return for deposits . intragovernmental-transactions nonexchange-transactions -- intragovernmental : revenue 306 . interest on treasury-securities held by trust-funds and special-funds ( except trust revolving-funds ) . -- many trust-funds and special-funds hold treasury-securities on which they receive interest . in most cases the invested balances of these funds derive predominantly from the funds ' earmarked taxes , which are nonexchange-transactions with the public ( e.g. , employment-taxes and gasoline-taxes ) , and to a lesser extent from other financing-sources received from other government-entities ( e.g. , the general-fund payment appropriated to the supplementary medical-insurance fund ) . the balances are not earned in exchange-transactions by the entity 's operations . most fundamentally , they are not produced by operations in which the entity incurs a cost . 307 . therefore , in such cases , the interest on treasury-securities should not be deducted from the gross-costs of the trust-fund ( or special-fund ) , or the organization in which it is administered , in determining its net-cost of operations . as a result , that interest should not be classified as exchange-revenue . it should instead have the same classification as the predominant-source of the invested balances , which for most trust-funds ( and special-funds ) is nonexchange-revenue . the interest received from invested balances of trust-funds and special-funds ( except trust revolving-funds ) is therefore normally a nonexchange-revenue . 308 . the source of balances for some trust-funds and special-funds may not be predominantly nonexchange-revenue . for example , the main-source of balances for two major-trust-funds , the civil-service-retirement and disability fund and the military 60sffas no . 5 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government , para . 54 . retirement-fund , consists of exchange-revenue and other financing-sources . in such exceptional-cases , as explained in the basis for conclusions , the interest should be classified in the same way as the predominant-source of balances -- in these cases , as exchange-revenue -- rather than according to the normal-rule . 309 . interest received by one fund from another. -- one fund within the government may borrow from another . for example , in 1983 the old-age and survivors-insurance trust-fund borrowed from the disability insurance and hospital-insurance trust-funds . when that occurs , the lending-fund sacrifices interest from treasury-securities on its invested balances and instead receives interest from the borrowing-fund on the amount of the loan . since the predominant-source of balances to the lending-fund is the same regardless of whether it invests in treasury-securities or lends to another fund , the interest received from the other fund should be classified in the same way -- as nonexchange or exchange-revenue -- as the interest received on treasury-securities . 310 . employer-entity-contributions to social-insurance programs.61 -- federal-employees may be covered by social-insurance-programs such as social security62 and medicare under the same terms and conditions as the rest of the covered population . intragovernmental-contributions to social-insurance-programs such as social-security and medicare are nonexchange-transactions , just as payments made by private-employers to these programs are nonexchange-transactions . contributions by private-employers are in the nature of taxes ; i.e. , compulsory-payments demanded by the government through the exercise of its power to compel payment . insofar as the social-insurance-program applies to federal-employees , the terms and conditions are generally the same as the program for private-employees . the employer and employee-contributions are generally calculated in the same way ; the employer-entity-contribution is not earned by the social-insurance-program ; and the benefits are generally calculated in the same way . the employee does not obtain particular-benefits under the plan from rendering-service in federal-employment , because he or she would have been similarly covered by the program if privately employed and would have received similar-benefits . for these reasons , the employer-entity-contribution should have the same classification as private-employer-contributions , which is nonexchange-revenue . nonexchange-transactions -- intragovernmental : gains and losses 311 . retirement of debt-securities prior to maturity : trust-funds and special-funds ( except trust revolving-funds ) . -- treasury-securities held by trust-funds and special-funds are primarily issued in the government-account-series , which can generally be redeemed on demand . other treasury-securities held by these funds may also be callable or redeemable on demand . if these debt-securities are retired before maturity , the difference , if any , between the reacquisition-price and the net carrying-value of the extinguished-debt should be recognized as a gain or loss by the fund that owned the securities . the gain or loss should be accounted for as a nonexchange-gain or loss if 61 '' social-insurance '' does not include programs established solely or primarily for federal-employees , such as pension and other retirement-plans . 62 most federal civilian-employees hired before 1984 are not covered by social-security . the interest on the associated-debt-securities is classified as nonexchange-revenue , and it should be accounted for as an exchange-gain or loss if the interest on the associated-debt-securities is classified as exchange-revenue . for trust-funds ( except trust revolving-funds ) and special-funds , as explained elsewhere , the interest is normally but not always a nonexchange-revenue . 312 . the difference , if any , between the reacquisition-price and the net carrying-value of the extinguished-debt should be recognized as a loss or gain in accounting for interest on treasury debt . the amount should be equal in absolute-value but with the opposite-sign to the gain or loss recognized by the trust-fund or special-fund . the amount should be recognized as a gain or loss from exchange in order to offset it against the gross-interest on treasury debt in the government-wide consolidated financial statements . 313 . cancellation of debt. -- the debt that an entity owes treasury ( or other agency ) may be canceled by act of congress . the amount of debt that is canceled ( including the amount of capitalized-interest that is canceled , if any ) is a gain to the entity whose debt is canceled and a loss to treasury ( or other agency ) . the purpose of borrowing-authority is generally to provide an entity with capital rather than to finance its operations . therefore , the cancellation of debt is not earned by the entity's operations and is not directly related to the entity 's costs of providing-goods and services . as a result , the cancellation is a nonexchange-gain to the entity that owed the debt and a nonexchange loss to the lender . exchange-transactions -- intragovernmental : revenue 314 . intragovernmental-sales of goods and services by a revolving fund. -- the cost of providing-goods or services by a revolving-fund is defrayed in whole or in part by selling the goods or services provided . intragovernmental-sales may be made by an organization that maintains either an intragovernmental revolving-fund ( such as the defense business-operations fund ) or a public-enterprise revolving-fund ( such as the postal-service ) . each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . the proceeds are an exchange-revenue . 315 . intragovernmental-sales of goods and services by a fund other than a revolving fund. -- the cost of providing-goods or services is defrayed in whole or in part by selling the goods or services provided . each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . the proceeds are an exchange-revenue . 316 . employer-entity-contributions to pension and other retirement-benefit-plans for federal employees. -- employees of the federal government provide service to their employer in exchange for compensation , of which some is received currently ( the salary ) ; and some is deferred ( pensions , retirement-health-benefits , and other retirement-benefits ) . this is an exchange-transaction , because each party-sacrifices-value and receives value in return . as part of this transaction , the government promises a pension and other retirement-benefits ( especially-health-benefits ) to the employees after they retire . the financing of these benefits may include contributions paid by the employer-entity to the retirement-fund . 317 . in broad-terms , the employer-entity-contribution is an inflow of resources to the retirement-fund as part of this exchange-transaction . more narrowly , it is a payment by the employer-entity in exchange for the future-provision of a pension or other retirement-benefit to its employees . therefore , it is an exchange-revenue of the entity that administers the retirement-plan and thus is an offset to that entity 's gross-cost in calculating its net-cost of operations.63 318 . employer-entity-contributions to health-benefit-plans for current-coverage of federal employees. -- employees of the federal government provide services to their employer in exchange for compensation , of which some is received currently in the form of money ( the salary ) ; some is received currently in the form of payments to a third party ( the employer-entity-contribution to the medical-insurance-plan for current-coverage of the employees ) ; and some is deferred ( pensions and other retirement-benefits ) . this is an exchange-transaction , because each party-sacrifices-value and receives value in return . as part of this exchange-transaction , the government and its employees both contribute to a medical-insurance-plan that provides current-coverage of its employees . 319 . in broad-terms , the employer-entity-contribution is an inflow of resources to the health-benefits plan as part of this exchange-transaction . more narrowly , it is a payment in exchange for current-coverage of the employer-entity 's employees by a health-benefits plan . therefore , it is an exchange-revenue of the entity that operates the health-benefits plan and thus is an offset to that entity 's gross-cost in determining its net-cost of operations . 320 . employer-entity-payments for unemployment-benefits and workers compensation. -- the employer-entity recognizes a liability and an expense for federal-employees who are laid-off or injured on the job and are entitled under law to unemployment-benefits or workers-compensation , respectively.64 the payment to the former or current-employee is made by the unemployment-trust-fund ( department of labor ) in the case of unemployment-benefits and by the special-benefits fund ( department of labor ) in the case of workers-compensation . unemployment-benefits are reimbursed by the former employer-entity ; and workers-compensation-costs are mostly charged back to the employer-entity . 321 . since the costs are recognized by the employer-entity and its payment to the unemployment-trust-fund or the special-benefits fund reimburses these funds for the costs they incur , the amounts these funds receive from the employer-entity are exchange-revenues . 322 . interest on treasury-securities held by revolving funds. -- a revolving-fund conducts a cycle of business-type-operations in which the expenses are incurred to produce goods and services that generate revenue , and the revenue , in turn , finances expenses . revolving-funds need capital in their operations and may invest some of that 63for further discussion of the accounting-standards for pensions and other retirement-benefits for federal-employees , see sffas no . 5 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government , para . 56-93 and 148-181 . the standards do not cover accounting for the plan per se as distinct from the administering-entity . nor do they cover defined contribution-plans , or administrative-entities that are not federal-reporting-entities . 64see sffas no . 6 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government , para . 96 and para . 181 , footnote 70. capital in treasury-securities . since their holding of invested balances and the sale of goods and services are both integral to the funds ' operations , the interest on the funds ' securities is related to the funds ' cost of operations just as is the revenue earned from selling-goods and services . furthermore , the source of the invested balances is predominantly-revenue earned from their sales of goods and services , for which the funds incurred-costs of operations when that revenue was earned . the interest they receive should therefore be classified in the same way as their revenue earned from selling-goods and services and should likewise be deducted from gross-cost in determining the net-cost of operations . for this reason , interest earned by revolving-funds should normally be classified as exchange-revenue . 323 . the source of balances for some revolving-funds may not be predominantly-exchange-revenue . for such exceptions , as explained in the basis for conclusions , the interest should be classified in the same way as the predominant-source of balances rather than according to the normal-rule . 324 . interest on treasury-securities held by trust revolving funds. -- a trust revolving-fund is a revolving-fund that is also classified by law as a trust-fund . like other revolving-funds , it earns exchange-revenue , which is an offset to its gross-cost . for example , the revenue that the employees health benefit fund earns from contributions by federal-employees , annuitants , employer entities , and the office of personnel-management ( opm ) is an offset to the insurance-premiums that it pays to private-firms . trust revolving-funds need capital in their operations , just like other revolving-funds , the source of which is predominantly the revenue they have earned . when some of their capital is invested in treasury-securities , the interest is related to their cost of operations in the same way as the revenue earned from selling services . furthermore , the source of the invested balances is predominantly-revenue earned from the sales of services , for which they incurred-costs of operations when the revenue was earned . the interest they receive should therefore be classified in the same way as the interest received by other revolving-funds , which is exchange-revenue . 325 . the source of balances for some trust revolving-funds may not be predominantly-exchange-revenue . for such exceptions , as explained in the basis for conclusions , the interest should be classified in the same way as the predominant-source of balances rather than according to the normal-rule . 326 . interest on uninvested-funds received by direct-loan and guaranteed-loan-financing accounts. -- a guaranteed-loan-financing account holds uninvested-balances as reserves against its loan-guarantee-liabilities and earns interest on these balances that adds to its resources to pay these liabilities . a direct-loan financing-account may hold uninvested-balances to bridge transactions that are integral to its operations , such as when it borrows from treasury to disburse direct-loans prior to the time of disbursement ; it earns interest on these balances to reflect the time-value of money and thereby finance the interest it pays on its debt to treasury . thus , in both cases , the interest received by the financing-account is earned through exchange-transactions with treasury and is an offset to the financing-account 's related-costs of operations . the interest is therefore an exchange-revenue of the financing-account . 327 . interest received by treasury. -- accounts or funds ( including direct-loan and guaranteed-loan-financing accounts ) may be authorized to borrow from the treasury or from the federal financing bank ( an entity within treasury ) or other sources . the interest that the entity pays on its borrowings is a cost to the entity and an inflow of resources to the treasury . the treasury may be deemed to have borrowed from the public to finance the outlays for which the entity borrowed , and thus to have incurred a corresponding-interest-cost of its own . the interest received by treasury from the entity is therefore related to treasury 's cost of borrowing from the public and should be classified as an exchange-revenue . exchange-transactions -- intragovernmental : gains and losses 328 . note : as explained in the introduction to this appendix , transactions that are classified as producing-gains or losses should instead be classified as producing-revenue or expense if they are usual and recurring for a particular-reporting-entity . 329 . retirement of debt-securities prior to maturity : revolving-funds and trust revolving funds. -- treasury-securities held by revolving-funds and trust revolving-funds are primarily issued in the government-account-series , which can generally be redeemed on demand . other treasury-securities held by these funds may also be callable or redeemable on demand . if these debt-securities are retired before maturity , the difference , if any , between the reacquisition-price and the net carrying-value of the extinguished-debt should be recognized as a gain or loss by the fund that owned the securities . the gain or loss should be accounted for as a nonexchange-gain or loss if the interest on the associated-debt-securities is classified as nonexchange-revenue , and it should be accounted for as an exchange-gain or loss if the interest on the associated-debt-securities is classified as exchange-revenue . for revolving-funds and trust revolving-funds , as explained elsewhere , the interest is normally but not always an exchange-revenue . 330 . the difference , if any , between the reacquisition-price and the net carrying-value of the extinguished-debt should be recognized as a loss or gain in accounting for interest on treasury debt . the amount should be equal in absolute-value but with the opposite-sign to the gain or loss recognized by the revolving-fund or trust revolving-fund . the amount should be recognized as a gain or loss from exchange in order to offset it against the gross-interest on treasury debt in the government-wide consolidated financial statements . other financing-sources -- intragovernmental 331 . appropriations. -- appropriations -- a form of budget-authority -- permit an entity to incur-obligations and make payments and thus are a means of financing the entity 's cost . they are not otherwise related to the entity 's cost and therefore are not an offset to its gross-cost in determining its net-cost of operations . they are not earned by the entity 's activities , demanded by the entity , or donated to the entity . therefore , appropriations provide an other financing-source instead of a revenue . 332 . more precisely , `` appropriations used '' is recognized as an other financing-source in determining the entity 's operating results when the entity receives goods and services or provides benefits , grants , or other transfer-payments . to avoid double-counting , appropriations used are not recognized for the appropriation of earmarked revenues or other financing-sources , which are already counted in determining the entity 's operating results . appropriations that have been made available for apportionment but have not been used are recognized as `` unexpended appropriations '' in the entity 's capital . 333 . cost-subsidies : difference between internal-sales-price ( reimbursement ) and full cost. -- one entity may receive goods or services from another entity without paying the full-cost of the goods or services or without paying any cost at all . other federal-accounting-standards may require the receiving-entity to recognize the full-cost as an expense ( or , if appropriate , as an asset ) . in these cases the difference between full-cost and the internal-sales-price or reimbursement ( sometimes called a `` transfer-price '' ) is an imputed-cost to the receiving entity.65 334 . the financing of the imputed-cost is also imputed to the receiving-entity . imputed-financing is necessary so that the imputed-cost does not reduce the entity 's operating results and net-position . the imputed-financing equals the imputed-cost and is recognized as an other financing-source . it is not a revenue , because the receiving-entity does not earn the amount imputed or demand its payment . 335 . cost-subsidies : difference between the service-cost of pensions ( and other retirement-benefits ) , less the employee-contributions , if any , and the employer-entity contributions. -- the service-cost of pensions ( and other retirement-benefits ) to the employer-entity , less the employee-contributions , if any , is recognized as a cost to the employer-entity . the difference between the employer-entity 's cost and its contributions , if any , is imputed to the employer-entity as part of its recognized cost . for pensions , the cost recognized by the employer-entity is more than its contribution for employees who are covered by the civil-service-retirement system and several minor-systems ( in a few of which the employer-entity does not make any contributions toward the service-cost ) . for retirement health-care-benefits , neither the employees nor the employer-entity make any contributions while the employee is working.66 therefore , the entire-service-cost is recognized as a cost to the employer-entity and imputed to it . 336 . the financing of the imputed-cost is also imputed to the employer entity.67 the imputed-financing is necessary so that the imputed-cost does not reduce the employer-entity 's operating results and net-position . the imputed-financing equals the imputed-cost and is recognized as an other financing-source . it is not a revenue , because the employer-entity does not earn the amount imputed or demand its payment.68 65see sffas no . 4 , managerial-cost-accounting concepts and standards for the federal government , para . 105-115 . 66retired-employees do pay premiums , however , and the service-cost to the employer-entity is defined net of the actuarial-present value of those future-premiums . 67the employer-entity 's own contribution , if any , is generally financed by an appropriation but could be financed by earned revenue or other sources . 68for further discussion of the accounting-standards for pensions and other retirement-benefits for federal-employees , see sffas no . 5 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government , para . 56-93 and 148-181 . the standards do not cover accounting for the plan per se as distinct from the administering-entity . nor do they cover defined contribution-plans , or administrative-entities that are not federal-reporting-entities . 337 . ( this transaction differs from the immediately preceding transaction , in which an entity does not pay the full-cost of the goods or services it receives from another entity . in the present-case , the employer-entity acquires the services of the employees itself , but another entity pays part of their cost . ) 338 . contribution by the general-fund to the smi trust fund. -- the general-fund makes a contribution to the smi ( supplementary medical-insurance ) trust-fund . this appropriated payment is separate from the transfer of earmarked premiums and is not a transfer of earmarked taxes or other income . it does not arise from an exchange-transaction , because smi does not sacrifice any value to the general-fund in exchange for the payment , and the general-fund does not receive anything of value from smi . instead , the payment constitutes a general-fund subsidy of the smi trust-fund . since the payment is not demanded or earned , it is an other financing-source to smi rather than a revenue . 339 . examples of other payments of a similar-nature ( and also classified as other financing-sources ) are the payment by the general-fund to the social-security-trust funds for military service-credits and for certain uninsured-persons at least 72 years old ; and the payment by the general-fund to the railroad-retirement board for the vested dual-benefit-payments received by certain retirees under both the railroad-retirement and the social-security systems . the quinquennial military service credit adjustment paid between the general-fund and the social-security-trust funds is likewise an other financing-source to the social-security-trust funds but one that may be either-positive or negative . 340 . transfer by ccc to federal crop-insurance corporation. -- the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) makes transfers to the federal crop-insurance corporation ( fcic ) , which it finances by an appropriation . this payment does not arise from an exchange-transaction , because fcic does not sacrifice anything of value to ccc , and ccc does not receive anything of value from fcic . it differs from the contribution to smi primarily in that it is paid by another program-entity ( the ccc ) rather than directly by the general-fund . since the payment is not demanded or earned , it is an other financing-source to fcic rather than a revenue . 341 . interchange between the railroad-retirement board and the social-security and hospital-insurance trust funds. -- the railroad-retirement board pays benefits equivalent to the amounts that would have been paid if railroad-workers had been covered under social-security since its inception , plus additional-amounts unique to that program . the railroad-retirement-program is partly financed by an annual financial-interchange that takes place between the railroad social-security equivalent benefit-account ( a trust-fund ) and the trust-funds for old-age and survivors-insurance , disability insurance , and hospital-insurance ( oasdhi ) . the interchange is designed to place each of the oasdhi trust-funds in the same position as it would have been if railroad-employment had been covered under social-security since its inception . 342 . the amount of the payment reflects the difference between ( a ) the benefits that the oasdhi trust-funds would have paid to railroad-workers and their families if railroad-employment had been covered by oasdhi and ( b ) the payroll-taxes that the oasdhi trust-funds would have received if railroad-employment had been covered by oasdhi . if benefits would have exceeded taxes , the oasdhi trust-funds make a payment to the railroad social-security equivalent benefit-account ; if benefits would have been less , the oasdhi trust-funds receive a payment . currently oasi and di make payments to that account , and hi receives payment . the interchange differs from the examples in the previous-cases primarily in that ( a ) the payment is between two trust-funds and ( b ) the payment may be made in either direction . 343 . the financial-interchange does not arise from an exchange-transaction , because it is a reallocation of resources among funds , all of which are financed primarily from nonexchange-revenue . furthermore , the nature of this reallocation is such that the transferring-entity does not receive anything of value and the recipient-entity does not sacrifice anything of value . therefore , the recipient-entity recognizes the transfer-in as an other financing-source , and the transferring-entity recognizes the transfer-out as a negative-financing-source . 344 . transfer of cash and other capitalized-assets without reimbursement. -- cash and other capitalized-assets may be transferred without reimbursement from one government-entity to another . cash may include exchange-revenue that is recognized by the transferring-entity in determining its net-cost of operations but is required to be transferred to the general-fund or another entity ; other capitalized-assets may include general-property , plant , and equipment . the receiving-entity does not sacrifice anything of value , and the transferring-entity does not acquire anything of value . therefore , the transfer is not an exchange-transaction . the receiving-entity recognizes the transfer-in as an other financing-source ; the transferring-entity recognizes the transfer-out as a negative-financing-source . the amount recorded by both entities is the transferring-entity 's book value of the asset . 345 . transfer of property , plant , and equipment without reimbursement : types that are expensed. -- property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) of types that are expensed ( i.e. , stewardship pp & e ) may be transferred from one government-entity to another . if the asset was classified as stewardship pp & e in its entirety by both the transferring-entity and the recipient-entity , the transfer does not affect the net-cost of operations or net-position of either entity and therefore in such a case it is not a revenue , a gain or loss , or other financing-source . 346 . however , if the asset that is transferred was classified as general pp & e for the transferring-entity but stewardship pp & e for the recipient-entity , it is recognized as a transfer-out ( a negative other financing-source ) of capitalized-assets by the transferring-entity . revaluations 347 . revaluation of capitalized-property , plant , and equipment. -- capitalized-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) may be removed from the general pp & e accounts if it no longer provides service in the operations of the entity because it has suffered damage , become obsolete in advance of expectations , or is identified as excess . it is recorded as an asset at its expected-net-realizable value . any difference between the book value and the expected-net-realizable value is recognized as a gain or loss in determining the net-cost of operations , because the revaluation results from the entity 's operations . the expected-net-realizable value is adjusted at the end of each period , and any further revaluation is also recognized as a gain or loss in determining the net-cost of operations.69 348 . since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurred but does affect net-cost , an amount equal to the revaluation is recognized in determining the reconciliation between obligations incurred and net-cost of operations . a reconciliation is not needed in determining the change in net-position , because the revaluation affects net-cost and net-position equally . 349 . revaluation of inventory and related property. -- inventory and related-property may be revalued for such reasons as determination that the property is excess , obsolete , or unserviceable ; that stockpile-materials have decayed or been damaged ; that a loss is estimated on commodity-purchase-agreements ; or that a change has occurred in the net realizable-value of commodities valued at the lower of cost or net realizable-value . the amount of revaluation is recognized as a loss or a gain in determining the net-cost of operations , because it results from the entity 's operations . assets are correspondingly reduced or increased.70 350 . since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurred , but does affect net-cost , an amount equal to the revaluation is recognized in determining the reconciliation between obligations incurred and net-cost of operations . a reconciliation is not needed in determining the change in net-position , because the revaluation affects net-cost and net-position equally . transactions not recognized as revenues , gains , or other financing-sources 351 . borrowing from the public. -- borrowing from the public is a means of financing the government 's outlays . however , it is not a net-inflow of resources to the treasury or other borrowing-entity , because the asset received ( cash ) is offset by an equal-liability ( debt ) . therefore , it is not revenue or an other financing-source . 352 . borrowing from treasury , the federal financing bank , or other government accounts. -- an entity may be provided the authority to borrow from treasury , the federal financing bank , or other government-accounts . intragovernmental-borrowing is a means of financing the entity 's outlays . however , it is not a net-inflow of resources to the entity , because the asset received ( cash ) is offset by an equal-liability ( debt ) . therefore , it is not revenue or an other financing-source . 353 . disposition of revenue to other entities : custodial transfers. -- revenue , primarily nonexchange-revenue , may be collected by an entity acting on behalf of the general-fund or another entity within the government on whose behalf it was collected . the collecting-entity-accounts for the disposition of revenue as part of its custodial-activity . these custodial-transfers , by definition , do not affect the collecting-entity 's net-cost of operations or operating results , nor are they part of the reconciliation between its obligations and net-cost of operations . ( the receiving-entity 69sffas no . 6 , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , para . 39 . 70see sffas no . 3 , accounting for inventory and related-property , para . 29-30 , 47-48 , 54 , 97 , and 107. recognizes the revenue as nonexchange or exchange-revenue , depending on its nature , according to the applicable-revenue standards . ) 354 . sales of different types of government assets. -- the sale of government-assets ( other than forfeited-property ) is an exchange-transaction , because each party receives and sacrifices-something of value . as a general-rule , any difference between the sales-proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss when the asset is sold . the remainder of the transaction does not provide a net-inflow of resources , so no gain , revenue , or other financing-source is recognized . if the sales-proceeds equal-book-value , there is no gain or loss , because the exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value is not a net-inflow of resources . 355 . this general-rule applies to property , plant , and equipment , receivables ( other than direct-loans ) , foreclosed-property associated with pre-1992 direct-loans and loan-guarantees , and miscellaneous-assets . it does not apply to inventory , nor does it apply to forfeited-property ( as explained in the previous-section on nonexchange-revenue ) . it also does not apply to the sale of direct-loans and the sale of foreclosed-property associated with post-1991 direct-loans and loan-guarantees . the latter-transactions are discussed in subsequent-paragraphs . 356 . acquisition of property , plant , and equipment through exchange. -- the cost of property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) acquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fair value of the pp & e surrendered at the time of exchange . if the fair value of the pp & e acquired is more readily-determinable than that of the pp & e surrendered , the cost is the fair value of the pp & e acquired . if neither fair value is determinable , the cost of the pp & e acquired is the cost recorded for the pp & e surrendered-net of any accumulated depreciation or amortization . in the event that cash-consideration is included in the exchange , the cost of pp & e acquired is increased ( or decreased ) by the amount of the cash surrendered ( or received ) .71 357 . any difference between the cost of the pp & e acquired and the book value of the pp & e surrendered is recognized as a gain or loss . if the cost of the pp & e acquired equals the book value of the pp & e surrendered , there is no gain or loss ( nor a revenue or other financing-source ) , because the exchange of one asset for another of equal-value does not provide a net-inflow of resources . therefore , the amount of the transaction equal to the book value of the pp & e surrendered is not recognized as a gain , a revenue , or an other financing-source . 358 . transfer of property , plant , and equipment without reimbursement : types that are expensed. -- property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) of types that are expensed ( i.e. , stewardship pp & e ) may be transferred from one government-entity to another . if the asset was classified as stewardship pp & e in its entirety by both the transferring-entity and the recipient-entity , the transfer does not affect the net-cost of operations or net-position of either entity and therefore in such a case it is not a revenue , a gain or loss , or other financing-source . 359 . however , if the asset that is transferred was classified as general pp & e for the transferring-entity but stewardship pp & e for the recipient-entity , it is recognized as a transfer-out ( a negative other financing-source ) of capitalized-assets by the 71see sffas no . 6 , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , para . 32. transferring-entity . 360 . if multi-use-heritage-assets are transferred and some cost was recognized for them on the books of the transferring-entity , that cost is recognized as a transfer-out ( a negative other financing-source ) of capitalized-assets . no amount is recognized by the entity that receives the asset.72 361 . donation of property , plant , and equipment : types that are expensed. -- the acquisition-cost of stewardship-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) is recognized as a cost when incurred . such pp & e consists of federal-mission pp & e , heritage-assets , and stewardship-land . when such pp & e is donated to the government , however , no amount is recognized as a cost.73 since the donation of such pp & e does not affect the net-cost or net-position of the recipient-entity , it is not a revenue , a gain , or an other financing-source . 362 . negative-subsidies on post-1991 direct-loans and loan guarantees. -- a negative-subsidy means that the direct-loans or loan-guarantees are estimated to make a profit , apart from administrative-costs ( which are excluded from the subsidy calculation by law ) . the amount of the subsidy-cost is recognized as an expense when the direct-loan or guaranteed-loan is disbursed . a negative-subsidy is recognized as a direct-reduction in expense , not as a revenue , gain , or other financing source.74 363 . downward-subsidy-reestimates for post-1991 direct-loans and loan guarantees. -- a downward-subsidy-reestimate means that the subsidy-cost of direct-loans or loan-guarantees is estimated to be less than had previously been estimated . the initial-subsidy-cost is recognized as an expense ; a positive-subsidy-reestimate is recognized as an expense ; and a downward-subsidy-reestimate is recognized as a direct-reduction in expense , not as a revenue , gain , or other financing-source . 364 . fees on post-1991 direct-loans and loan guarantees. -- the present-value of estimated-fees is included as an offset in calculating the subsidy-cost of direct-loans and loan-guarantees , which is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed . the present-value of estimated-fees is likewise included as one component in calculating the value of loans receivable or loan-guarantee-liabilities . when cash is received in payment of fees , the loans receivable-decrease by an equal-amount ( or the loan-guarantee-liabilities increase by an equal-amount ) . the increase in one asset is offset by an equal-decrease in another asset ( or by an equal-increase in liabilities ) . therefore , fees are not recognized as a revenue , a gain , or an other financing source.75 365 . repayment of post-1991 direct loans. -- the present-value of estimated-loan 72sffas no . 6 , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , para . 61 and 72 . 73ibid . 74for-standards on direct-loans and loan-guarantees , see sffas no . 2 , accounting for direct-loans and loan-guarantees . the accounting for negative-subsidy-costs is symmetrical to the accounting for positive-subsidy-costs . 75 the fee-component of the subsidy-cost is required to be disclosed separately . repayments is included in the calculation of the subsidy-cost of direct-loans , and this subsidy-cost is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed . the present-value of estimated-loan repayments is likewise included in the value of the loans receivable . when cash is received for the repayment of loans , the loans receivable-decrease by an equal-amount . the increase in one asset is offset by an equal-decrease in another asset . therefore , cash-inflow from the repayment is not recognized as a revenue , a gain , or an other financing source.76 366 . repayment of pre-1992 direct loans. -- when pre-1992 direct-loans are repaid in whole or in part , the entity-exchanges one asset ( loans receivable ) for another ( cash ) with equal-value . there is no net-inflow of resources . therefore , the amount of cash-inflow equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue , a gain , or an other financing source.77 367 . repayment of receivables : except direct loans. -- when receivables other than direct-loans are paid or repaid in whole or in part , the entity-exchanges one asset ( loans receivable ) for another ( cash ) with equal-value . there is no net-inflow of resources . therefore , the amount of cash-inflow equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue , a gain , or an other financing source.78 368 . sales of direct loans. -- the sale of a direct-loan is a modification according to the federal credit reform act of 1990 regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after fy 1991 or before fy 1992 . the book-value-loss ( or gain ) on a sale of direct-loans equals the book value of the loans sold ( prior to sale ) minus the net-proceeds of the sale . it normally differs from the cost of modification , which is recognized as an expense.79 any difference between the book-value-loss ( or gain ) and the cost of modification is recognized as a gain or loss.80 the amount of cash-inflow equal to book value is not a net-inflow of resources to the entity , because it is an exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value . therefore , the amount of cash-inflow equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue , a gain , or an other financing-source . 76 if the actual-repayment is different from the previous-estimate , the present-value of the difference between cash-inflows and outflows over the term of the loan -- calculated as of the date of disbursement -- is reestimated and is recognized as a subsidy-expense or a reduction in subsidy-expense . 77 if the loan is not repaid , the unpaid-amount is recognized as an adjustment to the bad-debt-allowance and does not affect revenue , gains , or other financing-sources . 78 if the receivable is not repaid , the unpaid-amount is recognized as an adjustment to the bad-debt-allowance and does not affect revenue , gains , or other financing-sources . 79 this difference is due to the different-interest-rates used to discount future-cash-flows for calculating the subsidy-cost ( and subsidy-allowance ) when the loan is disbursed and for calculating the cost of modification at a later-time . if the sale is with recourse , the present-value of the estimated-loss from the recourse is also recognized as an expense . 80sffas no . 2 , accounting for direct-loans and loan-guarantees , para . 53-55 and appendix b , part ii ( b ) . 369 . sales of foreclosed-property : associated with post-1991 direct-loans and loan guarantees. -- the net-present value of the cash flow from the estimated-sales of foreclosed-property is included in calculating the subsidy-cost of post-1991 direct-loans and loan-guarantees . this subsidy-cost is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed . when property is foreclosed , the property is recognized as an asset at the net-present value of its estimated-net cash-flows . when the foreclosed-property is sold , any difference between the sales-proceeds and the book value ( i.e. , the net-present value as of the time of sale ) requires a reestimate of the subsidy-expense , which is recognized as a subsidy-expense or a reduction in subsidy-expense . the amount of cash flow equal to book value is an exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore is not recognized as a gain , a revenue , or an other financing source.81 370 . deposit-fund transactions. -- deposit-funds are accounts outside the budget that record amounts that the government ( a ) holds temporarily until ownership is determined or ( b ) holds as an agent for others . the standards and guidance in this statement do not apply to deposit-funds except insofar as a particular-deposit fund may be classified as part of a federal-reporting-entity or a disclosure may be required due to a fiduciary-relationship on the part of a federal-reporting-entity toward a deposit-fund . 81 see sffas no . 2 , accounting for

property owned by the federal government and meeting the definition of one of the following three categories : • heritage-assets - property , plant , and equipment of historical , natural , cultural , educational , or artistic-significance . • federal-mission pp & e - property , plant , and equipment integral to certain unique federal-missions . • stewardship-land - land other than that acquired for or in connection with general pp & e . stewardship-investments - items treated as expenses in calculating net-cost but meriting special-treatment to highlight their substantial-investment and long-term-benefit-nature . this includes : • nonfederal physical-property - grants provided for properties financed by the federal government , but owned by the state and local governments . • costs incurred for education and training-programs that are designed to increase or maintain national economic-productive capacity and research-efforts to provide future-benefits or returns . these include : -human capital - education and training-programs financed by the federal government for the benefit of the public . -research and development - basic and applied-research and development . stewardship-responsibilities - the projected financial-impact on the government of sustaining current-services that it provides . projections of current-services provided by the government-aid in assessing the sufficiency of future budgetary-resources to sustain public-services and meet obligations as they come due . this assessment , termed a current-services-assessment , provides receipt and outlay-data on the basis of projections of future-activities . all stewardship-information is deemed `` required supplemental-stewardship-information '' ( rssi ) . audit-requirements for rssi will be established in a collaborative-effort by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the general-accounting-office ( gao ) . table of contents chapter 1 : introduction and background 4 . each standard is summarized briefly in a box followed by a detailed-explanation of the standard . however , the standards comprise the summaries in the boxes and the entire-text of the explanations . background and rationale 5 . the concepts-statement , objectives of federal financial-reporting was developed on the basis of an in-depth-assessment of user-needs and is used to guide the board in developing federal-accounting and reporting-standards . the objectives cover four areas : budgetary-integrity , operating performance , stewardship , and systems and control . 6 . this statement of accounting-standards addresses the objective of reporting on stewardship over certain-resources entrusted to the federal government and responsibilities assumed by it . the need for a report on the federal government 's stewardship over the resources entrusted to it and the responsibilities it has assumed , arises because of the unique-nature of the federal government , as described in the following-section . stewardship and the reporting-objectives 7 . `` financial position '' is a representation of an entity's economic-resources and the claims on those resources as of a particular-date . in the private sector , the principal-objective of reporting on financial position is to assess the viability of the entity , the business-firm , and its potential profitability . 8 . assessing the overall-performance of the federal government is not exclusively a matter of comparing-revenue and expense , or its accumulated assets and liabilities . 9 . the federal government 's viability and perpetuity are assumed . it has unique-access to financial-resources and financing , and the power to tax , to borrow , and to create money . for the federal government , financial performance is a vital-issue , but traditional financial measures provide data that are appropriate for assessing only some , not all , of the responsibilities for which the government should be held accountable . since it exists not to make a profit but to serve the needs of the citizens and to promote the general-welfare of the nation , other measures of accountability need to be used . measures of accountability are to be reported for elements that are defined as stewardship-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) ; stewardship-investments ; and stewardship-responsibilities . these elements of stewardship exist because the federal government is dissimilar to industrial and commercial entities . financial condition 10 . the measures of accountability mentioned above help to portray the government 's `` financial condition . '' financial condition is a broader and more forward-looking-concept than is financial position . financial condition allows an assessment of an entity on the basis of additional-data that could include financial and nonfinancial-information about current-conditions . these additional-data provide a more complete-indication of performance . in some cases , it may be necessary to present and characterize financial-data in ways that differ from traditional financial-reporting and to supplement traditional-data with nonfinancial-data . in other cases , it may be necessary to rely almost entirely on nonfinancial-data to provide a more complete-presentation of entity-performance . moreover , assessment of financial condition could include analysis of trends , demands , commitments , events , and uncertainties.4 stewardship pp & e 11 . `` stewardship pp & e '' consists of items whose physical-properties resemble those of general pp & e traditionally capitalized in financial statements . however , the nature of these federal physical-assets that are classified as stewardship pp & e differ from general pp & e in that their values may be indeterminable or may have little-meaning ( for example , museum collections , monuments , assets acquired in the formation of the nation ) or that allocating the cost of such assets ( for example , military-weapons-systems and space-exploration-hardware ) to accounting-periods that benefit from the ownership of such assets is meaningless . however , the federal government should be able to demonstrate accountability for stewardship pp & e by reporting on its existence and on its condition by a reference to deferred maintenance reported in the financial statements . stewardship pp & e would include stewardship-land ( that is , land not acquired for or in connection with general-property , plant , and equipment ) ; heritage-assets ( for example , federal monuments and memorials and historically or culturally significant-property ) ; and federal-mission-property , plant , and equipment ( for example , space-exploration and military-weapons-systems ) . stewardship-investments 12 . `` stewardship-investments '' are substantial-investments made by the federal government for the benefit of the nation . when incurred , they are treated as expenses in determining the net-costs of operations . however , these items merit special-treatment so that readers of government financial-reports know the extent of these investments that are made for long-term-benefit . such investments will be measured in terms of expenses incurred for certain education and training-programs ; federally financed research and development ; and federally financed but not federally owned property , such as bridges and roads . 4 chapter 7 of the objectives of federal financial-reporting provides a full-discussion of financial position and financial condition . 13 . because the government has been entrusted with and made accountable for these resources , they should be reported in the financial-reports of the government and of its component-entities . this will help satisfy the stewardship-objective defined in the concepts-statement , objectives of federal financial-reporting , sffac no . 1 . the goal of the stewardship-objective is that the federal government `` report on the broad-outcomes of its actions . '' such reporting may provide information that could help report-users assess the impact of the government 's operations and investments for the period.5 stewardship-responsibilities 14 . a key-aspect of the stewardship-objective requires that federal reporting provide information that helps users determine ( 1 ) whether the government 's financial condition improved or deteriorated over the period and ( 2 ) whether future budgetary-resources will likely be sufficient to sustain public-services and to meet obligations as they come due.6 15 . information on `` stewardship-responsibilities '' will aid in these determinations . it will provide an essential-perspective on the government 's commitment to discretionary and mandatory-programs . 16 . reporting on this stewardship-responsibility may be accomplished in a stewardship-section in the consolidated financial-report of the federal government . stewardship-categories or elements 17 . in defining the specific-categories of items , or elements , that would appear as stewardship-information , the board decided on the following : • property owned by the federal government and meeting the definition of one of the following three categories : -property , plant , and equipment of historical , natural , cultural , educational or artistic-significance , referred to as heritage-assets , for example , the washington monument and the lincoln memorial ; 5 see sffac no . 1 , pp . 41-42 . 6 ibid. , pp . 42-44 . -property , plant , and equipment that are integral to meeting a unique federal-mission , referred to as federal mission7-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) , and -investments in stewardship land,8 that is , land not acquired for or in connection with general-property , plant , and equipment , for example , national-forests , parks , and historic-sites . some investments in stewardship-land , for example national-parks , will be reported by both 1 ) the number of acres used as a park or an historic-site in the stewardship-land-category , and 2 ) by the number of physical-units identified as national-parks in the heritage-assets-category . such reporting would not be considered duplication , as the type of information reported on an item would be different for each category of stewardship-asset . • properties financed by the federal government but owned by state and local governments , referred to as nonfederal physical-property , for example , highways and bridges . • expenses that are incurred for education and training that are intended to increase national economic-productive capacity or for research and development that are intended to provide future-benefits or returns . this includes : -investments in human-capital , that is , education and training-programs provided by the federal government , for example , job-training programs , and grants for higher education . -investments in research and development , for example , research on the effects of early medical-intervention in delaying the onset of aids symptoms in hiv-positive-individuals , and federal-investment in genetic-code-research to advance national medical-research . • information on the projected financial-impact on the government of providing current-services , assuming a continuation of current-programs . this information will be in the form of a current-services-assessment providing future-receipt and outlay-data on the basis of projections of future-activities 7 the term `` federal-mission '' refers to activities that are typically federal , such as national-defense . in addition , federal-mission pp & e is limited to pp & e that would not typically be used by non-federal-entities . clearly , any functions performed by a federal-entity could be broadly labeled `` federal-mission . '' the definition of this category , however , clarifies the characteristics of pp & e appropriately included in this category -- a much narrower group than inferred by the category 's title . 8 the board is including only surface-land as supplementary-stewardship-information because the issues associated with other than surface-land , i.e. , the natural-resources on and under that land , are complex . the board is researching these complex-issues and will publish a separate-exposure-draft on a proposed accounting standard for natural-resources at a later-date . for the government as a whole and will include both discretionary and mandatory-programs and interest on debt . 18 . the previous-categories of items or elements result from or exist largely because of the federal government 's role as a sovereign-power . the components that they include are defined and discussed in detail in their respective-chapters of this standard . the nature of stewardship-reporting 19 . the board , recognizing the federal government 's size , complexity , diversity , and impact on others , has determined that the aforementioned-information is needed in addition to that included in financial statements . 20 . such information may not link directly with the basic financial statements because the data to be reported may be other than financial , for example , physical-units or projections . it will supplement the basic financial statements . 21 . this information , as indicated in each of the standards , will be designated as required-supplementary-stewardship information ( rssi ) for the consolidated financial statements of the federal government and of the entities who have stewardship-responsibilities over resources identified earlier in this document . the board has chosen to call this rssi to distinguish it from `` required supplementary-information '' ( rsi ) , for which audit-responsibilities are prescribed in existing professional-literature . the board believes that omb and gao should establish and cause the implementation of the audit-responsibilities for rssi . stewardship-information 22 . stewardship-information may be presented in varying formats depending on the nature of the federal-investments or claims to federal-resources controlled by an entity . such information is required for those entities ( 1 ) that control stewardship-resources and ( 2 ) whose financial statements purport to be in accordance with federal-accounting-principles as recommended by fasab , and approved by the secretary of the treasury , the director of omb and the comptroller general . 23 . examples of selected portions of stewardship-report sections are included at appendix b . measurement 24 . the separate-standards for each stewardship-element contain specific-guidance for that element . in general , however , stewardship-investments shall be measured on the same basis of accounting as used for financial statements , including appropriate accrual-adjustments , general and administrative-overhead , and a share of the cost of facilities ( for example , depreciation ) .9 25 . for investments that are intended to maintain or increase the economic-productive capacity of the nation , that is , investments in human-capital , research and development , and nonfederal physical-property , trend-data shall be presented . trend-data should reflect the full-cost ( including-allocation of facility and administrative-costs ) of the investment . 26 . for stewardship-land and heritage-assets , measurement will be done on other than a financial-basis . for example , measurement may be on the basis of physical-units , such as acres of land . specific-data-requirements are addressed in the individual stewardship-standards . 27 . generally , amounts shall be reported in nominal-dollars . if trend-data that span many years are reported and the entity believes that constant-dollar-information would be meaningful for data-interpretation , constant-dollar-data may be provided in addition to nominal-dollar-data . 28 . split grants . frequently , stewardship-elements are financed by grants . in some cases , the grants may have more than one purpose.10 for such grants , the investment shall be allocated among stewardship-elements on the basis of an estimate of the proportionate-funding of the various-grant-objectives . if allocation is not feasible , the investment shall be reported on the basis-of-the predominant-use of the grant . 29 . performance-indicators . for some stewardship-elements , categorization of these elements as investments is predicated on producing-outputs and outcomes . the specific-procedures , including a phasing-in-process for requiring such justification , is contained in the individual respective-standards . 30 . reporting program-expenses . trend-data reported on stewardship-investment-elements should reflect the full cost11 of the investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding 4 years . additional-years ' data also may be reported if such data would better indicate the investment-nature of an item . 9see managerial-cost-accounting concepts and standards , sffas no . 4 , for a discussion of federal cost-accounting principles and standards . 10 an example of a grant with a split-purpose is a grant issued to a teaching-hospital to perform both medical-education and medical-research . 11see managerial-cost-accounting concepts and standards , sffas no . 4 , for a discussion of federal cost-accounting principles and standards . 31 . in some cases , before the issuance of federal-accounting-standards , entities have maintained records on the basis of outlays rather than expenses . it may be impracticable for such entities to reconstruct their accounts on the basis of expense . in such cases , entities may report data on an outlay-basis for any years for which expense-data are not available . at the end of 5 years , entities should have sufficient-expense-data to be able to report expenses rather than outlays . 32 . reporting deferred maintenance . many state and local governments , members of congressional-oversight committees , and national-groups , have raised the issue of the deteriorating condition of federally-owned pp & e because of deferred maintenance associated with these assets . the issue was addressed in association with pp & e . as a result , a deferred maintenance-standard in accounting for property , plant , and equipment , sffas no . 6 , establishes reporting-requirements related to the condition and future-maintenance-requirements for pp & e . 33 . these requirements are flexible since different conditions may be considered acceptable by different-entities , as well as for different-items of pp & e held by the same entity . the deferred maintenance-standard is applicable to all pp & e whether the pp & e is reported as general pp & e or stewardship pp & e . reporting-requirements 34 . within each of the standards , minimum required and , in some cases , recommended reporting is described . these requirements and recommendations , including a phasing-in-process for entities who may not have required data available at the implementation of the standards , are contained in the individual-standards . these requirements describe the nature of items to be reported by federal-entities ; guidance on the form and content of agency financial-reports , including the specific-guidance on the format in which items addressed in this statement will be reported , will be prescribed by omb . 35 . reporting should be at the major-program or category-level ; individual-transactions need not be reported unless significant . additional-reporting is encouraged when preparers believe such information would make the financial-report more meaningful or understandable . social-insurance 36 . the board first considered accounting and reporting for social-insurance-programs while considering-sffas no . 5 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government . the board concluded , at that time , that the topic should be made part of the supplementary-stewardship reporting project . 37 . research and deliberations regarding social-insurance have continued as part of the supplementary-stewardship reporting project . however , the board , recognizing the magnitude and complexity of these programs , the strength of the views on the accounting and reporting-issues , the significant-attention being focused on these programs at the present-time , and the potential for change to the programs , has again concluded that additional-consideration is appropriate before issuing final-guidance . accordingly , the board has not included guidance on social-insurance in this statement and has added a social-insurance accounting project to its agenda . applicability 38 . this standard requires that the consolidated financial-reports12 of the federal government and the financial-reports12 of its component-units contain rssi relating to : • amounts invested in human-capital , research and development , and nonfederal physical-property ; and • quantities ( stated in terms of physical-units or dollars ) of land , heritage-assets , and federal-mission-property . although fasab 's sponsors do not set accounting-standards for the legislative or judicial-branches , federal-accounting-standards would be appropriate for them . 39 . because the financial-reports of the federal government present the aggregation of information about stewardship-investments and assets related to varied-agencies and programs , further deliberations by the board are needed to reach a decision on the amount and nature of information to be required under this standard for reporting in the consolidated financial-report . accordingly , except for the standard described in chapter 8 , '' current-service assessment , '' the effective-date of the stewardship-standards as they apply to the consolidated financial-report , is deferred pending that decision . the effective-date of the standard in chapter 8 is for fiscal-periods beginning after september 30 , 1997 . in the interim , the consolidated financial-reports should include such summary or selected information as is feasible . experimentation is encouraged , as is the reporting of such additional information as will enhance the financial-report . 40 . some federal-entities , including those government-corporations listed in the government corporation control act and certain-others , such as the us postal-service , are required by law or policy to publish financial statements pursuant to the standards issued by the financial-accounting-standards board ( fasb ) . ( some entities also may be required to prepare statements pursuant to standards set by a regulatory-agency . that practice would not be affected by this statement of standards . ) for such entities , this standard provides the following general-principles : 12 the terms `` financial statements '' and `` consolidated financial statements '' are used throughout this document to refer to the basic financial statements of a reporting-entity ; the basic financial statements normally include : the balance sheet , the statements of net-cost , changes in financial position , financing , budgetary-resources , and custodial-activities and the notes to the financial statements . the terms `` financial-reports '' and `` consolidated financial-reports '' are used to refer to a document which would include the financial statements but which would also include items such as : a management-discussion and analysis-section , a statement of program-performance-measures , required supplemental-information or required-supplementary-stewardship information not included in the financial statements or other supplemental financial and management-information . • applying applicable-accounting-principles - separately issued ( stand-alone ) general-purpose financial statements on such entities should apply applicable-accounting-principles that will best meet user-needs and comply with any relevant-statutory requirements . this principle would continue to be true for separately issued-statements even if , pursuant to the provisions below , other information about these entities might need to be presented when their financial statements are included within reports of a larger federal-entity . • reporting additional or supplementary-information - when financial information on such entities is included in general-purpose financial-reports of a larger federal-reporting-entity ( including treasury 's consolidated financial-report ) , any applicable-standards recommended by the fasab and issued by omb and the general-accounting-office ( gao ) that call for additional-reporting or supplementary-information should be applied . • applying applicable-standards when differences arise - when financial information on such entities is included in general-purpose financial-reports of a larger federal-reporting-entity ( including treasury 's consolidated financial-report ) , standards recommended by fasab and issued by omb and gao should be used if the difference arising from differences between federal-accounting-standards and fasb 's would be material to users of the report of the larger entity . chapter 2 : heritage-assets heritage-assets heritage-assets shall be reported as required-supplementary-stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the federal government and the component-units of the federal government responsible for such assets . heritage-assets shall be reported in terms of physical-units rather than cost , fair value , or other monetary-values . definition 43 . `` heritage-assets '' are pp & e that are unique for one or more of the following-reasons : • historical or natural-significance ; • cultural , educational or artistic ( for example , aesthetic ) importance ; or • significant architectural-characteristics . 44 . heritage-assets are generally expected to be preserved indefinitely . one example of evidence that a particular-asset is heritage in nature is that it is listed on the national register of historic-places . 45 . some investments in heritage-assets , for example national-parks , will be reported by both 1 ) the number of physical-units identified as national-parks in the heritage-assets-category , and by 2 ) the number of acres used as a park or an historic-site in the stewardship-land-category ( see chapter 4 of this document ) . such reporting would not be considered duplication , as the type of information reported on an item would be different for each category of stewardship-asset . measurement 46 . heritage-assets shall be quantified in terms of physical-units ( for example , number of items in collections or the number of national-parks ) . no asset-amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of the federal financial statements for heritage-assets . 47 . the costs of acquiring , constructing , improving , reconstructing , or renovating-heritage-assets shall be considered an expense in the period incurred when determining the net-cost of operations.13 the cost shall include all costs incurred to bring the heritage-asset to its current-condition and location . multi-use-heritage-assets 48 . not all heritage-assets are used solely for heritage purposes -- some serve two purposes by providing-reminders of our heritage and by being used in day-to-day-government-operations unrelated to the assets themselves . the cost of renovating , improving , or reconstructing operating-components of heritage-assets used in government-operations shall be included in general pp & e . the renovation , improvement , or reconstruction-costs to facilitate government-operations ( for example , installation of communication-wiring or redesign of office-space ) would be capitalized and depreciated over its expected useful-life . the cost should not be depreciated over an unrealistically long life . 49 . costs of renovating or reconstructing the heritage-asset that can not be associated directly with operations shall be considered heritage-asset-costs and included as expense in calculating net-costs . minimum reporting 50 . the determination of the most relevant-information to be presented should be made by the preparer ; however , reporting at the entity-level shall be more specific than at the governmentwide-level . the following are examples of information that should be considered for presentation : • description of each major-category of heritage-asset . • the number of physical-units added and withdrawn from the heritage-asset-records during the year and the end-of-year-number of physical-units for each type of heritage-asset . heritage-assets consist of ( 1 ) collection-type-heritage-assets , such as objects gathered and maintained for exhibition , for example , museum collections , art-collections , and library-collections ; and ( 2 ) noncollection-type-heritage-assets , such as , parks , memorials , monuments , and buildings . • description of the methods of acquisition and withdrawal of heritage-assets . 13for guidance in measuring and reporting the cost of heritage-assets transferred from other federal-entities , and heritage-assets acquired through donation or devise , see the general pp & e standard contained in accounting for property , plant , and equipment , sffas no . 6 . • condition14 of the assets unless it is already reported in a note to the financial statements in which case a reference to the note will suffice . • a reference to a note to the financial statements if deferred maintenance is reported for the assets.15 implementation-guidance 51 . for guidance on heritage-assets that were previously recognized as assets for balance-sheet-reporting , see statement of federal financial-accounting-standards ( sffas ) no . 6 , accounting for property , plant and equipment , paragraphs 63 , 64 , and 65 . 14examples of condition-information include , among others , ( 1 ) averages of standardized condition rating codes ; ( 2 ) percentage of assets above , at , or below acceptable-condition ; or ( 3 ) narrative information . 15for guidance relating to deferred maintenance-reporting , see the deferred maintenance-standard in accounting for property , plant , and equipment , sffas no . 6 . chapter 3 : federal-mission pp & e federal-mission-property , plant , and equipment federal-mission-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) shall be reported as required-supplementary-stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the federal government and the component-units of the federal government responsible for such pp & e . federal-mission pp & e shall be valued and reported using either the total-cost or the latest acquisition-cost-valuation method . definition 52 . federal-mission pp & e includes items used to meet a federal-government-mission in which the specific pp & e used is an integral part of the output of the mission.16 pp & e should be considered federal-mission pp & e if it possesses at least one of each of the two types of characteristics presented below . one type of characteristic relates to the use of federal-mission pp & e , and the other relates to its useful-life . 53 . characteristics related to the use of the federal-mission pp & e are that it • has no expected nongovernmental-alternative-uses ; or • is held for use in the event of emergency , war or natural-disaster ; or • is specifically designed for use in a program for which there is no other program or entity ( federal or nonfederal ) using similar pp & e with which to compare costs . 54 . characteristics related to the useful-life are that it • has an indeterminate or an unpredictable useful life17 because of the unusual-manner in which it is used , improved , retired , modified or maintained , or • is at a very high risk of being destroyed during use or of premature-obsolescence . 16 the name `` federal-mission pp & e '' may cause-readers to erroneously assume that this category should include any pp & e supporting a federal-mission . federal-mission pp & e is limited to those items specifically identified-herein as well as any other items exhibiting at least one characteristic from each of the two groups listed . 17 this may be evidenced by the ability ( 1 ) to retire the pp & e and later return it to service or ( 2 ) to continually upgrade the pp & e to maintain its usefulness . 55 . federal-mission pp & e excludes land whether the land is general pp & e land or stewardship-land . 56 . federal-mission pp & e , however , specifically includes ( 1 ) weapons-systems pp & e ( for example , fighter or attack aircraft , submarines , and tracked-combat-vehicles ) and ( 2 ) space-exploration equipment ( for example , space-hardware and launch , tracking , and recovery-facilities ) . weapons-systems and space-exploration equipment are defined in the following-paragraphs . 57 . weapons-systems . weapons-systems are a combination of one or more weapons18 with all related-equipment , materials , services , personnel , and means of delivery and deployment required for self-sufficiency.19 this standard-addresses only the pp & e component of weapons-systems . pp & e included in weapons-systems are distinguished from general-property , plant , and equipment held by defense-agencies and defense-support-agencies in that they are intended to be used directly by the armed forces to carry out combat-missions , when necessary , and to train in peacetime . 58 . weapons-systems include only those assets owned by defense-agencies and defense-support-agencies that would otherwise meet the property , plant , and equipment-definition . items-meeting other than the pp & e asset-category-definitions are excluded from federal-mission pp & e , such as items of inventory or operating-materials and supplies . 59 . space-exploration equipment . space-exploration equipment includes • items that are intended to operate above the atmosphere for space-exploration-purposes , and • any specially designed equipment to aid , service , or operate other equipment engaged in exploring-space . measurement 60 . federal-mission pp & e shall be valued using either the total-cost or the latest acquisition-cost-valuation method . 61 . there is a presumption that the valuation-method previously used by the entity was appropriate for the circumstances and , therefore , should be applied on a consistent-basis . accordingly , the preparer shall justify any changes in the use of a valuation-method . 18weapons are instruments of combat used to destroy , injure , defeat or threaten an enemy . ( adapted from dictionary of weapons and military-terms ) 19joint-chiefs of staff , department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms , joint publication 1-02 , march 23 , 1994 . 62 . for purposes of this standard , the `` total-cost-method '' is defined to include the actual-acquisition-cost of each item held plus the costs of any additions , improvements , alterations , rehabilitations , or replacements that extend the useful-life of the federal-mission pp & e . 63 . under the latest acquisition-cost-method , all like units that are held are valued at the invoice-price of the most recent like item purchased , less any discounts , plus additional-costs described in the following-paragraphs . 64 . using either cost valuation-method , the cost assigned to an item of pp & e shall include all costs incurred to bring the federal-mission pp & e to a form and location suitable for its intended-use . for example , the cost of acquiring federal-mission pp & e may include : • amounts paid to vendors ; • transportation-charges to the point of initial-use ; • handling and storage-costs ; • labor and other direct or indirect-production-costs ( for assets produced or constructed ) ; • engineering , architectural , and other outside-services for designs , plans , specifications , and surveys ; • acquisition and preparation-costs of buildings and other facilities ; • an appropriate-share of the cost of the equipment and the facilities used in construction-work ; • fixed equipment and related-installation-costs required for activities in a building

facilities and equipment donated to the government ; and • material-amounts of interest-costs paid.20 65 . no asset-amount shall be shown on the balance sheet for federal-mission pp & e . 20 '' interest-costs '' include any reimbursable-interest paid by the reporting-entity directly to providers of goods or services related to the acquisition or construction of federal-mission pp & e . it excludes any interest-costs paid by a reporting-entity in financing its own debt . 66 . the acquisition-cost of federal-mission pp & e shall be considered an expense in determining the net-costs of operations in the period acquired . the cost of constructing , improving , reconstructing , or renovating federal-mission pp & e also shall be considered an expense in determining net-costs in the period incurred . 67 . for acquisitions of federal-mission pp & e where costs are incurred over a number of years , the portion of the cost incurred during the reporting-period shall be considered an expense in the period incurred in determining the net-cost of operations and the total-cost to date considered an acquisition-in-process cost in the required-supplementary-stewardship information . minimum reporting 68 . federal-mission pp & e shall be reported as required-supplementary-stewardship information . reporting at the entity-level for federal-mission pp & e shall be more specific than at the governmentwide-level . at a minimum , the following-information shall be reported : • a description of major-types of federal-mission pp & e by the holding-entity and the values assigned under the valuation-method used . • the value of federal-mission pp & e added and withdrawn during the year , the increase or the decrease in value resulting from revaluations of assets held to latest acquisition-cost , and the end-of-year-value for each major-type of property using the entity 's valuation-method . • a description of the methods of acquisition and withdrawal of federal-mission pp & e . this should be reported at the major-program or category-level ; individual-transactions , unless significant , need not be reported . • condition21 of the assets unless it is already reported in a note to the financial statements in which case a reference to the note will suffice . • a reference to the applicable-note to the financial statements if deferred maintenance is reported for the assets . implementation-guidance 69 . for guidance on federal-mission pp & e previously recognized as assets for balance-sheet-reporting , see sffas no . 6 , accounting for property , plant , and

condition-information include , among others , ( 1 ) averages of standardized condition rating codes ; ( 2 ) percentage of assets above , at , or below acceptable-condition ; or ( 3 ) narrative information . chapter 4 : stewardship-land stewardship-land land not acquired for or in connection with22 items of general pp & e , that is , stewardship-land , shall be reported as required-supplementary-stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the federal government and the separate-reports of component-units of the federal government responsible for such land . stewardship-land shall be reported in terms of physical-units rather than cost , fair value , or other monetary-values . definition 71 . `` land '' is defined as the solid-part of the surface of the earth . excluded from the definition are the natural-resources ( that is , depletable-resources , such as mineral-deposits and petroleum ; renewable-resources , such as timber ; and the outer-continental-shelf-resources ) related to land . 72 . although the federal government holds vast-amounts of '' proven '' and `` inferred '' natural-resources , the major-reasons for addressing only surface-land in this project were ( 1 ) the allotted time frame within which to complete this standard ; ( 2 ) existing-studies that point out the difficulties and the complexities of accurately estimating and valuing natural-resources ; and ( 3 ) disputes regarding the boundaries of the outer-continental shelf.23 73 . land and land-rights24 owned by the federal government and acquired for or in connection with items of general pp & e shall be accounted for and reported as general pp & e . 74 . land and land-rights owned by the federal government and not acquired for or in connection with items of general pp & e will be reported as stewardship-land . examples of stewardship-land include land used as forests and parks , and land used for wildlife and grazing . 22 '' acquired for or in connection with '' is defined as including land acquired with the intent to construct general pp & e and land acquired in combination with general pp & e , including not only land used as the foundation , but also adjacent-land considered to be the general pp & e 's common-grounds . 23 the board presently has an active-project to address standards for natural-resources . 24 '' land-rights '' are interests and privileges held by the entity in land owned by others , such as leaseholds , easements , water and water-power-rights , diversion-rights , submersion-rights , rights-of-way , mineral-rights , and other like interests in land . measurement 75 . stewardship-land shall be quantified in terms of physical-units ( for example , acres ) rather than in monetary-terms . 76 . no asset-amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of the federal financial statements for stewardship-land . 77 . the acquisition-cost of stewardship-land shall be considered an expense in the period acquired when determining the net-cost of operations . 78 . in some cases , land may be acquired along with existing-structures . the following-treatments may apply : • if the structure , which would be deemed a heritage-asset , is significant in and of itself , the entity shall use its judgement as to whether the acquisition-cost shall be treated as the cost of stewardship-land , heritage-asset , or both ; • if the structure is to be used in operations ( for example , as general pp & e ) but 1 ) the value of the structure is insignificant , or 2 ) its acquisition is merely a byproduct of the acquisition of the land , the cost in its entirety shall be treated as an acquisition of stewardship-land ; or • only significant-structures that have an operating-use ( such as , a recently constructed hotel or employee-housing-block ) shall be treated as general pp & e by identifying the cost-attributable to general pp & e and segregating it from the cost of the stewardship-land acquired . 79 . however , no amounts for stewardship-land acquired through donation or devise25 shall be recognized as a cost in calculating net-cost . the fair value of the property , if known and material , shall be disclosed in notes to the financial statements . if fair value is not estimable , information related to the type and quantity of assets received shall be disclosed in the year received . 80 . any costs to prepare stewardship-land for its intended-use ( for example , razing a building ) shall be expensed as a part of the cost of stewardship-land . minimum reporting 81 . reporting at the entity-level for stewardship-land shall be more specific than at the governmentwide-level . minimum reporting shall include the following : • the number of physical-units of stewardship-land by category of major-use , broken down within that category by principal-holding-agency . • where parcels of stewardship-land have more than one use , the predominant-use of the land shall be considered the major-use . examples of major-uses of stewardship-land include forests and wildlife , grazing , parks , recreation , and historic-sites . in cases where land has multiple-uses , none of which is predominant , a description of the multiple-uses shall be presented . • acquisitions , withdrawals , and ending-balance should be shown by major-categories of use , and methods of acquisition and withdrawal identified . reporting should be at the major-category level ; individual-transactions , unless significant , need not be reported . • the condition26 of the stewardship-land , unless it is already reported in a note to the financial-statement , in which case a reference to the note will suffice . • a reference to the note to the financial statements if deferred maintenance is reported for the assets.27 25 a will or clause of a will disposing of property . implementation-guidance 82 . for guidance relating to stewardship-land that was previously

physical-property expenses included in calculating net-cost for nonfederal physical-property-programs shall be reported as investments in required-supplementary-stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the federal government and the separate-reports of component-units of the federal government responsible for such investments . reporting will include data , in nominal-dollars , on investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding 4 years . additional-years ' data also may be reported if such data would provide a better indication of the nature of the investment . definition 83 . `` investment in nonfederal physical-property '' refers to those expenses incurred by the federal government for the purchase , the construction , or the major-renovation of physical-property owned by state and local governments , including major-additions , alterations , and replacements ; the purchase of major-equipment ; and the purchase or improvement of other physical-assets . grants for maintenance and operations are not considered investments . measurement 84 . `` expenses incurred '' - the financial-investment shall be measured on the same basis of accounting as used for financial-statement purposes , including appropriate accrual-adjustments , general and administrative-overhead , and costs of facilities.28 amounts shall be reported in nominal-dollars . 85 . cash-grants related to nonfederal physical-property-programs are recognized and reported as expenses in arriving at the net-cost of operations . 86 . expenses incurred for program-costs , contracts , or grants with split-purposes29 shall be reported on the basis of an allocation of the expenses . if allocation is not feasible , the investment shall be reported on the basis-of-the predominant application of the expense or transfer . 28see managerial-cost-accounting concepts and standards , sffas no . 4 , for a full-discussion of federal cost-accounting principles and standards . 29 an example of an investment with a split-purpose is a grant issued to a state to construct segments of the national highway system and to conduct highway-research . minimum reporting 87 . minimum reporting shall include the following : • annual investment30 shall be reported , including a description of federallyowned physical-property transferred to state and local governments . this information will be provided for the year ended on the balance-sheet-date as well as for each of the 4 years preceding that year . if data for additional-years would provide a better indication of investment , reporting of the additional-years ' data is encouraged . in those unusual-instances when entities have no historical-data , only current-reporting-year data need be reported . • reporting shall be at a meaningful-category or level , for example , a major-program or department . reporting of major investments at the entity-level shall be more specific than at the governmentwide-level . • in some cases , the information called for above is not available because entities have maintained records on the basis of outlays rather than expenses . for such entities to reconstruct their accounts on the basis of expense-data may be impracticable . agencies in this situation will continue to report historical-data on an outlay-basis for any years for which reporting is required and for which expense-data are not available . if neither historical-expense nor outlay-data are available for each of the 5 years , entities need report only expense-data for the current-reporting-year and such other years as available . at the end of 5 years , however , the agency will be able to report the expenses to be categorized as investments for nonfederal physical-property rather than the outlays for each of the preceding 5 years . • reporting shall include a description of major-programs involving federal-investments in nonfederal physical-property including a description of programs or policies under which non-cash-assets are transferred to state and local governments . recommended reporting 88 . reporting of the amount of significant-state and local-total contributions to shared or joint-programs is encouraged but is not required . if it is known , however , that other contributions in a significant amount were made , that fact ( for example , expressed as a percentage of the total-program ) shall be reported even if the exact-amount of the contribution is not known . 30as defined in this standard , `` annual-investment '' includes more than the annual-expenditure reported by character-class for budget-execution . `` annual-investment '' is the full-cost of the investment . full-cost shall be

demonstrated-outputs and outcomes consistent with the intent of the program . reporting will ordinarily include data in nominal-dollars on investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding 4 years . additional-years ' data also may be reported if such data would provide a better indication of the investment . definition 89 . `` investment in human-capital '' refers to those expenses incurred for programs for education and training of the public that are intended to maintain or increase national productive-capacity and that produce outputs and outcomes that provide evidence of maintaining or increasing national productive-capacity . 90 . the definition excludes education and training-expenses for federal civilian and military personnel . it also excludes education and training-expenses whose purpose is not maintaining or enhancing national productive-capacity . measurement 91 . `` expenses incurred '' - the investment shall be measured on the same basis of accounting as used for financial statements , including appropriate accrual-adjustments , general and administrative-overhead , and costs of facilities.31 amounts shall be reported in nominal-dollars . 92 . expenses incurred for programs , contracts , or grants with split purposes32 shall be reported on the basis of an allocation of the investment-expenses . if allocation is not feasible , the

until outcome-data are available . definitions and characteristics of outputs and outcomes are provided in the paragraphs that follow.33 • '' output '' - a tabulation , calculation , or recording of activity or effort that can be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative-manner . outputs shall have two key-characteristics : ( 1 ) they shall be systematically or periodically captured through an accounting or management-information-system , and ( 2 ) there shall be a logical-connection between the reported measures and the program 's purpose . examples of human-capital-output are high school and college-graduates as a percentage of population over 25 . • '' outcome '' - an assessment of the results of a program compared to its intended-purpose . outcomes shall : ( 1 ) be capable of being described in financial , economic , or quantitative-terms and ( 2 ) provide a plausible-basis for concluding that the program has had or will have its intended-effect . examples of human-capital outcomes are program-graduates obtaining-jobs within 2 months of program-completion or program-graduates obtaining-jobs making more money than they previously received on federal-aid . minimum reporting 94 . minimum reporting shall consist of : • the annual-investment34 made in the year ended on the balance-sheet-date as well as in each of the 4 years preceding that year shall be reported .

for the application or use of such knowledge and ideas for the development of new or improved-products and processes with the expectation of maintaining or increasing national economic-productive capacity or yielding other future-benefits . research and development is composed of • basic-research : systematic-study to gain knowledge or understanding of the fundamental-aspects of phenomena and of observable-facts without specific-applications toward processes or products in mind ; • applied-research : systematic-study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary for determining the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met ; and • development : systematic-use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research for the production of useful-materials , devices , systems , or methods , including the design and development of prototypes and processes.35 35see omb circular a-11 , section 44 . measurement 97 . `` expenses incurred '' - the investment shall be measured on

managers of the investment-program should be able to provide information on the outcomes for the programs for which the investments are reported.38 if outcome-data are not available ( for example , the agency has not agreed on outcome-measures for the program , the agency is unable to collect reliable-outcome-data , or the outcomes will not occur for several years ) , the outputs that best

from the prior-year , the number completed and the number terminated . it also might consist of such quantitative-measures as bibliometrics ( for example , publication-counts , citation-counts and analysis , and peer-evaluation ) ; patent-counts and analysis ; and science `` indicators '' that assess the ongoing vitality of the research ( for example , statistics on scientific and engineering-personnel , graduate-students and degree-recipients by field and sector ) .39 36see managerial-cost-accounting concepts and standards , sffas no . 4 , for a full-discussion of federal

the year ; -applied research - an identification of any major new applications that were developed during the year ; or -development - the progress of major developmental-projects including the results with respect to projects completed or otherwise terminated during the year and the status of projects that will continue . the information provided concerning-outcomes should be chosen to

consolidated financial statements of the federal government but not in individual-reports of its component-units . reporting of projected data for additional-years is encouraged where it would be useful and relevant . 102 . `` a current-services-assessment '' provides receipt and outlay-data on the basis of projections of future-activities . it is relevant for assessing the sustainability of programs established by current-law , that is , the sufficiency of future-resources to sustain public-services and to meet obligations as they come due . the csa focuses on the totality of government-operations rather than on individual-programs . it provides an analytical-perspective on the government because it shows the short- and long-term-direction of current-programs . measurement 103 . csa will present receipt and outlay-data published in the president 's budget . data will be presented for all programs for the base-year and at least 6 years subsequent to the base-year ,

basis for conclusions 109 . this appendix provides a discussion of the more significant-comments that the board received from respondents to the exposure-draft , supplementary-stewardship reporting , dated august 1995 and from testimony at a public-hearing on the exposure-draft that was held december 5 , 1995 . 110 . responses overall were generally-favorable to the concept of reporting-stewardship-information . in some cases , respondents had questions about the specific-reporting-requirements or requested clarification on particular-items . where feasible , these areas were addressed or clarified in the final-standards in this statement . in the case of issues raised by the respondents , this appendix explains the basis-of-the board 's conclusions . the nature of stewardship-reporting 111 . the exposure-draft presented the board 's approach to reporting in a manner other than is done in the basic financial statements for those items that it has categorized as stewardship-items . as the board stated in the introduction and background chapter of this statement , it believes that these stewardship-items warrant specialized reporting to highlight their importance and to portray them in additional-ways than provided by financial-accounting . the board designated a new category of reporting to highlight the unique-nature of stewardship-reporting , required supplemental-stewardship-information ( rssi ) . 112 . some respondents believed that , although reporting on stewardship-items might be warranted , a separate-manner of reporting might not . they believed that stewardship-reporting could be accommodated either within the basic financial statements , for example , as a note , or as required supplemental-information ( rsi ) . they did not see the need for the separate-category of rssi . 113 . the board , however , believes that a new category for reporting on stewardship-items is more appropriate . if stewardship-information were required to be reported in a note to the basic financial statements , it would be subject to the same level of audit-scrutiny as that of the basic financial statements . since some of the stewardship-information is non-financial , for example , physical-units , and other data is based on projections or assumptions , the same degree of audit-coverage as that of the basic financial statements for these items may not be appropriate . such data is not drawn directly from the financial-records . thus reliance on financial-records for audit-backup would not be feasible . 114 . on the other hand , the board believes that certain stewardship-information should receive more audit-scrutiny than it would if it were rsi . for rsi , the auditor reviews the data for overall-compliance with associated-guidance and for consonance with the basic financial statements . the auditor usually provides in-depth-review of the rsi only if there appears to be some problem with the data . if he or she believes that the data is not fairly presented , the auditor still may issue a clean-opinion on the basic financial statements while noting that there are problems with the rsi . 115 . therefore , the board has proposed that a new category , rssi , be designated to cover stewardship-reporting . by developing this new category , it is anticipated that audit-standards will be developed to address the specific-items in that category . although the board does not have authority to set audit-standards , it established rssi with the expectation that omb and gao will , in collaboration , determine appropriate-audit-procedures for this information . social-insurance 116 . consideration of guidance for the recognition , measurement and display of obligations for social-insurance-programs has continued to present the board with significant , vexing theoretical and practical-problems . the board notes the strength of feelings of respondents and commentators , some of whom believe a liability should be recognized for amounts that will be paid in future periods to or on behalf of current or future-program-beneficiaries and others who believe that there is no obligation associated with these programs that meets the definition of a liability , other than amounts due and payable at the end of an accounting-period ; additionally , some favor-disclosure of projected data relating to the magnitude of the present-value of future net-benefit-payments at a particular-date while others favor cash-flow-information for a long period of time . the board notes too the magnitude and complexity of these programs and the extreme-sensitivity of projections relating to the programs to assumptions whose range of possibilities is large . more importantly , the board notes that social-insurance-programs are presently being studied and discussed frequently and seriously within government and by the public ; a report and recommendations are expected shortly from the 1994-95 quadrennial advisory council on social-security . the prospects of significant-changes to the programs are reasonably high . 117 . after deliberating the issue , the board has concluded that additional-investigation and further deliberation is required and has directed the fasab staff to continue to research social-insurance issues focusing especially on : identifying the characteristics of programs which should cause them to be subject to the guidance provided in a statement on social-insurance ; the appropriate-display of information in the financial statements ; the identification of additional information , if any , which should be required for social-insurance-programs ; the means for measurement of financial-data included in such additional information ; and , the desirability of nonfinancial-indicators ( ratios of data to gdp or '' covered payroll '' ) to describe the status of programs or the implications of potential-changes to or needs of the programs.the board has instructed the staff to be mindful of all current developments in structuring its research and its recommendations . expensing stewardship pp & e 118 . echoing their earlier comments to the board 's exposure-draft , accounting for property , plant , and equipment , some respondents expressed-concern that expensing rather than capitalizing-costs associated with stewardship pp & e would lessen the value of the operating-statement as a tool for performance-measurement since it would overstate the cost in the year an asset is acquired . 119 . the board , however , believes that capitalizing and depreciating-stewardship pp & e provides information that is of little-usefulness . stewardship pp & e includes heritage-assets , federal-mission pp & e , and stewardship-land . period-costs related to stewardship pp & e are of diminished-usefulness because of uncertain useful-life ( e.g. , heritage-assets , federal-mission pp & e ) , uncertain historical-cost-basis ( e.g. , stewardship-land ) , or probability of being destroyed in use ( e.g. , federal-mission pp & e ) . therefore , the board believes that attempting to capitalize and depreciate-stewardship pp & e is not warranted . it believes that reporting on information related to the existence and the condition of the stewardship pp & e has more relevance to decision-makers and other users of the financial-report . costing of federal-mission pp & e 120 . respondents to the board 's question on whether the alternatives of presenting-costs of federal-mission pp & e in terms of either total ( historical ) or latest acquisition-cost generally believed that both options should not be allowed . some believed that use of alternative-methods would not ensure consistency in reporting . others believed that only total ( historical ) costs should be used . still others believed that total ( historical ) cost should be the long-term-goal , with the use of latest acquisition-cost allowed only until such historical-cost data would be available . 121 . the board , however , recognizes that significant practical-problems may arise if an agency is compelled to adopt a specified costing-approach for reporting-stewardship-assets , and that such cost-approach would not be used for computing the net-cost of operations . therefore , it believes that its decision to accept either the historical-cost or latest acquisition-cost-method is appropriate . however , it also emphasizes that once a method is chosen , an entity should switch to the other method only with appropriate-justification . reporting expense or outlay-data 122 . the standards require that expense-data be reported for investments in human-capital , research and development , and nonfederal physical-property . the standards also provide for a period of 5 years to transition to reporting-expense-data for those agencies that currently maintain only outlay-data . some board members suggested that since some agencies currently maintain only outlay-data , requiring that only outlay-data be reported might be more practical . however , the responses reflected a clear-consensus for reporting-expenses , with little or no support for reporting outlays only , and a minority preferring to report both expenses and outlays . therefore , the standards , as proposed , remain unchanged . request for more specificity in reporting-requirements 123 . when the board developed the standards for stewardship-reporting , its intention was to provide overall-guidance on definitions , recognition , measurement , and minimum and recommended reporting . this broad-guidance was intended to provide the basic-reporting requirements while allowing each entity-maximum flexibility in such areas as determining what constitutes the individual-stewardship-items for that entity , which costs are directly-attributable to the stewardship-item , and how best to report on multi-use-items so that users will gain the best picture of the entity 's financial and performance-information . 124 . the board believes that the desire for more specific-guidance expressed by several-respondents stems from the belief that without such guidance , an entity 's determination of how to apply the standards could be questioned . nevertheless , the board reiterates its position that entities should be provided maximum flexibility when applying the stewardship-standards . however , entities should make the determination of how best to apply the stewardship-standards based on a thorough-analysis of their individual-entity , including its mission , financial-practices , and the impact of its mission and operation on financial-report-users and on the nation . finally , all entity-determinations of the applicability of stewardship-standards should be thoroughly documented . issues for which changes were made to the proposed-standards 125 . multiple category reporting . some respondents were concerned that there would be double-counting if , as proposed by the standards , some stewardship-items would be reported in two separate-categories ; for example , yellowstone national park would be reported as a heritage-asset and as stewardship-land . 126 . reporting supplementary-stewardship-information in two categories will not be deemed double-counting . this is because where multiple-reporting is required , the units of measure are different for each of the stewardship-categories . in the example above , yellowstone national park would be reported under a category , such as `` national-parks , '' as one of the total number of heritage-assets under the auspices of the department of the interior ; it also would be reported by the number of acres that it occupies under the stewardship-land-category for the department . to clarify this point , the discussion of the process of multiple-reporting was expanded in the statement to explain that the board does not consider this reporting as double-counting . 127 . reporting the fair value for stewardship pp & e transferred to state or local governments . many respondents questioned the need for , and the cost/benefit of , requiring that the fair value of stewardship pp & e transferred to state and local governments be reported . they stated that monetary-values for stewardship pp & e are not required to be reported because such values are either-difficult to obtain ( e.g. , lack of historical-cost data on land acquired at the birth of the nation ) or not meaningful ( e.g. , the historical-cost to build the washington monument ) . therefore , they questioned the cost/benefit of requiring that the fair value of stewardship-property transferred to state and local governments be determined and reported . 128 . the board agreed that the fair value of stewardship-property transferred to state and local governments need not be determined and reported . the standards have been revised to require a description of the property-transfer-transaction ; if the fair value is known , nothing would preclude reporting it . effective-date for consolidated financial statements 129 . in considering required-reporting of stewardship-information , the board became increasingly-aware of the need to be highly-selective in proposing-requirements for the consolidated financial-report of the federal government . it recognized the potential for implementation-problems in the first few years after the effective-date of this statement . in addition to the normal problems associated with adapting to new standards , several of these standards provide for a transition-period during which agencies may or , in some cases , may not report investments in human-capital , research and development and nonfederal physical-property ; if investments are reported for each of five years as called for in this statement , they may be reported for earlier years during the transition-period on the basis of either outlays or expense . the merit of reporting the aggregate of information prepared on different-bases is questionable . 130 . further , the information required to be reported by these standards goes beyond that customarily accompanying financial-reports of governments or commercial-enterprises . standards related to heritage-assets and stewardship-land-call for reporting in terms of physical-units ( e.g. , number of parks or acres of land ) rather than in terms of historical-cost . implementation-problems are foreseen at the consolidated-statement-level because of differing measures . also , the board is concerned with the possibility of establishing-requirements so detailed as to render the consolidated financial-report unwieldy , unfriendly to the potential-user and obfuscating of important-information . 131 . because of these possible-implementation-problems and the need to consider other disclosures or presentations , the board expressed a desire for further deliberations relative to the consolidated financial-report of the federal government . 132 . accordingly , the effective-date of this statement will be for fiscal-years beginning after september 30 , 1997 as it relates to financial statements of component-units of the federal government ; this same effective-date applies to chapter 8 as it relates to the consolidated financial statements of the federal government . the effective-date of the statement as it applies to the consolidated financial statements , except for chapter 8 , is deferred pending further deliberations of the board . in the interim , the consolidated financial-reports should include such summary or selected information as is feasible . experimentation is encouraged , as is the reporting of such additional information as will enhance the financial-report . reporting of information not specifically addressed in the standards 133 . some respondents requested that the standards provide for reporting additional information , such as transfers of stewardship-property to foreign-governments , stewardship-land sold to the private sector , the federal government 's interest in such things as property held by nonfederal-entities or patents generated through federal-research and development-funds , and foreign-contributions to federal-programs . 134 . in developing the standards for stewardship-reporting , the board concentrated on providing-guidance in the principal-areas of stewardship-resources that have materiality for the majority of federal-entities and for the consolidated financial-reporting for the nation . the board 's intent was to ensure that these significant-areas , if material for an entity , would be reported regularly and in a consistent-manner . 135 . in some cases , an entity may have other resources or obligations that were not specifically addressed in the stewardship-standards , but that the entity believes may be material to the presentation of its stewardship-information . in such cases , if the reporting of such additional-data would be useful and relevant to readers , and would provide a better indication of the resources and obligations of the entity , the board encourages such reporting . appendix b : sample-reports note the sample-report-sections in appendix b are intended to illustrate the type of reporting contemplated by the board . certain data are taken from various-reports for one or more recent years and are `` actual-data . '' other data have been estimated by judgmentally extrapolating from `` actual-data . '' still other data and program-references have been fabricated and are hypothetical . therefore , readers should not rely on the validity of the data in the sample-reports . specific-form and content-guidance on financial-reports will be provided by omb . heritage-assets annual stewardship-information heritage-assets are pp & e that possess one or more of the following-characteristics : historical or natural-significance ; cultural , educational or aesthetic-value ; or significant architectural-characteristics . the cost of heritage-assets is not often-relevant or determinable . in addition , the useful-life of heritage-assets is generally not reasonably-estimable for depreciation-purposes . the most relevant-information about heritage-assets is their existence and condition . therefore , heritage-assets are reported in terms of physical-units . various-agencies operate and maintain heritage-assets . during the period , maintenance-expense is recognized as incurred . however , certain-maintenance was deferred over the past several years . below is information on deferred maintenance on stewardship-assets . summary of deferred maintenance as of september 30 , 199z ( in millions of dollars ) : acondition assessment survey ( cas ) . bsee accompanying-notes to the financial-statement for the reporting of condition of heritage-assets . cmany-paintings were refurbished at a cost of $ 5 million . refurbishment was required because of deficient-climate-control-equipment . dduring the fiscal year , three complete-collections of manuscripts and historical papers with an estimated-value of $ 17 million were donated to the library-collection . ethe number of deletions was negligible . federal-mission-property , plant , and equipment annual stewardship-information federal-mission-property , plant , and equipment ( pp & e ) comprise certain pp & e that possess at least one of each of the two types of the following-characteristics relating to the use of the property and its useful-life . characteristics related to use are that it : has no expected nongovernmental-alternative-use ; is held for use in the event of an emergency , a war , or a natural-disaster ; or , is used in a program for which there is no other comparable-program ( federal or nonfederal ) using similar pp & e . characteristics related to useful-life are that it : has an indeterminate or an unpredictable useful-life because of the unusual-manner in which it is used , improved , retired , modified , or maintained or is at a very high risk of being destroyed during use or of premature-obsolescence . generally accepted-government accounting-standards specifically recognize weapons-systems and space-exploration-facilities and equipment as federal-mission pp & e . at this time , only weapons-systems and space-exploration equipment have been identified as federal-mission pp & e for this entity . in the display that follows , items included under the caption '' weapons-systems '' are valued at the most recent-acquisition-cost of a comparable-item . those under the caption `` space-exploration '' are valued using the specific-identification-method , that is , the specific-cost of each unit of pp & e is attributed to that unit . in each category , cost includes all costs to put the item in usable condition for its intended-purpose including , among others , transportation , assembly , and inspection-costs . the value of land associated with the facilities included among federal-mission pp & e is not included in the display that follows . land data are included in a separate-section of this information entitled `` stewardship-land . '' virtually all items of federal-mission pp & e are useable for their intended-purposes at september 30 , 199z . in some cases , however , scheduled maintenance has been deferred . on the basis of engineering-estimates , the estimated-cost of deferred maintenance ranges from $ 200 to $ 300 million in 199z and $ 175 to $ 275 million in 199y . costs to complete critical-maintenance , that is , maintenance that , if not performed , could lead to irreparable-damage to the pp & e or to its unusability , range from $ 120 to $ 150 million . on the following-page is a summary of changes in federal-mission pp & e for the fiscal-years ended september 30 , 199z . federal-mission-property , plant , and equipment summaryf annual stewardship informationg for the fiscal year ended september 30

revaluation-adjustments ( column 2 ) ; and deletions and additions ( columns 3 and 4 ) . hincluded as expense in calculating net-cost . ifacilities include tracking , launching , and training facilities . stewardship-land annual stewardship-information '' land '' is defined as the solid-part of the surface of the earth . excluded from the definition of land for reporting-purposes here are materials beneath the surface ( that is , depletable-resources such as mineral-deposits and petroleum ) , the space above the surface ( that is , renewable-resources such as timber ) , and the outer-continental-shelf-resources . these materials will be addressed in a future-standard . the federal government holds approximately 650 million acres of land . land that is acquired for or in connection with items of general pp & e are reported on the balance sheet . land that is not acquired for or in connection with items of general pp & e is considered stewardship-land . of the total-amount of land held by the federal government , about 617 million acres are considered stewardship-land . the cost or value of stewardship-land is often not determinable . the most relevant-information about stewardship-land is its existence , condition , and use . therefore , stewardship-land is reported in terms of physical-units rather than cost , fair value , or other monetary-values . the major-uses of stewardship-land are for forests , wildlife , grazing , parks , recreation , and historic-sites . where parcels of stewardship-land have more than one use , the predominant-use of the land is considered the major-use . two federal-agencies are responsible for maintaining virtually all stewardship-land held by the federal government : the departments of the interior and agriculture . virtually all stewardship-land is useable for its purposes at september 30 , 1994 . in some cases , however , scheduled maintenance has been deferred . estimates of costs to complete critical-maintenance range from $ 40 to $ 50 million . `` critical-maintenance '' refers to maintenance that , if not performed , could lead to irreparable-damage to the assets or to unusability . on the basis of engineering-estimates , the estimated-cost of deferred maintenance ranges from $ 75 to $ 100 million in 199z . on the following-page is a summary of the stewardship-land by category of major-use , broken down within each category by principal-holding-agency , at september 30 , 199z . jsee accompanying-notes to the financial statements for the condition of

physical-property annual stewardship-information for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 199z annually , the federal government provides funding to state and local governments for the purchase , the construction , or the major-renovation of physical-property owned by state and local governments ; additionally , from time to time , the federal government-transfers pp & e to these governments in exchange for less than fair value . these grants and transfers relate to roads and transportation-systems , clean-water and environmental-projects , and other projects for the common-good . the investments in nonfederal physical-property in the 5 years from 199v to 199z were as follows : ( in billions of dollars ) 199v199w199x199y199zm transportation $ 19.0 $ 20.0 $ 20.0 $ 22.0 $ 23.0

transfers shown above in the `` community and regional development '' category , the fair value of land and facilities associated with former military-installations that were transferred to local governments approximated $ 40 million in 199y and $ 52 million in 199z . certain-transportation and environmental-programs involving federal-investments of $ 22 billion and $ 4 billion , respectively , in 199z required matching-support by local governments of about 20 percent and 80 percent of the federal-grants . mincluded as expenses in calculating net-cost . nexpenses of administration include an appropriate-allocation of agency-overhead-costs . human-capital annual stewardship-information for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 199z federal-investment in human-capital comprises those expenses for education and training-programs for the general-public that are intended to increase or maintain national economic-productive capacity . it does not include expenses for internal federal education and training . expense-data are expressed in nominal-dollars for the fiscal year being reported upon and the preceding 4 fiscal-years . following is a summary of stewardship-data for the

due for counseling-services delivered and educational-costs incurred by participants . rexpenses of administration include an appropriate-allocation of agency-overhead-costs . human-capital sample report ( continued ) program-outcomes preliminary-data appear to confirm that the services provided by the program accelerate the transition of participants into alternative-employment ; some savings are realized in the unemployment insurance fund . a follow-up-survey of the 415 participants in the year 199w showed that 80 % were earning at least as much as they were earning in their navy contractor-positions . a more extensive-evaluation , including an assessment of effects on long-term-earnings , is currently planned for completion in 1999 . narrative-discussion this program was authorized in 19xx ( by p.l . xx-xxx ) to ease the transition into other civilian-positions of skilled technical , administrative , and managerial-personnel who are no longer needed in certain-shipyards because of declining-orders for navy ship construction . eligibility is limited to those who have been employed at designated shipyards for at least 5 years , but who are not yet eligible for retirement-benefits . participants receive intensive counseling to help them develop individual-transition-plans . this counseling is provided by a private job placement service under contract . participants are then reimbursed up to $ 5,000 per year for up to 2 years , not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of the cost of tuition , fees , books , and other student-materials required for attendance at approved educational-institutions . an additional-increment of education or technical-training is expected to reduce the period of transitional-unemployment and increase the subsequent-earnings of participants . research and development annual stewardship-information for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 199z federal-investment in research and development comprises those expenses for basic-research , applied-research , and development that are intended to increase or maintain national economic-productive capacity or yield other benefits . expense-data are expressed in nominal-dollars for the fiscal year being reported upon and the preceding 4 fys . following is a summary of stewardship-data for the ceramic-materials research-programs for the 5

outcomes : the increasing number of articles published on the basis of funded-research , including-announcements of several newly discovered properties of certain composite-ceramics , is evidence of the utility of this part of the program . the number of patents emerging from the program is also increasing , primarily from the development-component of the program . narrative-discussion : this program was authorized in 19xx ( by p.l . xx-xxx ) to accelerate the development of this industry in the united states . the research-element of the program operates through interagency agreements with the federal laboratories and grants to university researchers . the researchers are selected through peer-review-procedures . the development-component provides grants to private-firms to develop improved manufacturing-procedures for ceramic materials-based-products and to accelerate the development of marketable-products incorporating advanced ceramic-materials . current-services-assessment annual stewardship-information a current-services-assessment ( csa ) provides receipt and outlay-data on the basis of projections of future-activities . it is relevant for assessing the sustainability of programs established by current-law . csa focuses on the totality of government-operations rather than on individual-programs . it provides an analytical-perspective on the government because it shows the short- and long-term-directions of current-programs . the following-display presents csa data for all programs for 6 years subsequent to the base-year . the data are identical to projected data prepared for the president 's budget for the same period ; the economic and program-assumptions are the same as used in that document . see display on next-page . volume i , version 1.0 february

terms presented in statements of federal financial-accounting-standards . some terms are designated as `` special-term from sffas # '' and are terms defined specifically for the standard indicated . these terms are not intended for general-application to other federal financial-transactions . abatement - a reduction or cancellation of an assessed tax . ( cooper w , ijiri y , kohler 's dictionary for accountants , 6th ed. , englewood cliffs , nj : prentice-hall , 1983 ; hereinafter referred to as kohler 's dictionary for accountants ) activity - the actual-work-task or step performed in producing and delivering-products and services . an aggregation of actions performed within an organization that is useful for purposes of activity-based costing . activity-analysis - the identification and description of activities in an organization . activity-analysis involves determining what activities are done within a department , how many people perform the activities , how much time they spend performing the activities , what resources are required to perform the activities , what operational-data best reflect the performance of the activities , and what customer-value the activity has for the organization . activity-analysis is accomplished with interviews , questionnaires , observation , and review of physical-records of work . it is the foundation for agency process value analysis , which is key to overall-review of program-delivery . activity-based costing - a cost-accounting-method that measures the cost and performance of process related-activities and cost-objects . it assigns cost to cost-objects , such as products or customers , based on their use of activities . it recognizes the causal-relationship of cost-drivers to activities . actual-cost - an amount determined on the basis of cost incurred including standard-cost properly adjusted for applicable variance . actuarial cost methods - a recognized actuarial-technique used for establishing the amount and the incidence of employer-contributions or accounting-charges for pension-costs under a pension-plan . actuarial-liability - a liability based on statistical calculations and actuarial-assumptions ( actuarial-assumptions are conditions used to resolve uncertainties in the absence of information concerning future events affecting-insurance , pension expenses , etc. ) . ( adapted from webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary and kohler 's dictionary for accountants ) actuarial-present value - the value of an amount or series of amounts payable or receivable at various-times , determined as of a given date by the application of a particular-set of actuarial-assumptions . ( actuarial-standards of practice no . 4 ) aggregate-entry-age normal - a system of applying the entry-age normal actuarial-cost-methodology using aggregate-population-models or groups instead of applying it individual by individual . allocations - the amount of obligational-authority transferred from one agency , bureau , or account that is set aside in a transfer appropriation-account to carry out the purpose of the parent appropriation or fund . ( jfmip , project on standardization of basic financial information-requirements of central-agencies , dated october 1991 , hereafter cited as jfmip standardization-project ) amortization -the gradual-extinguishment of any amount over a period of time through a systematic-allocation of the amount over a number of consecutive-accounting-periods such as the retirement of a debt by serial-payments to a sinking-fund . ( kohler 's dictionary for accountants ) . volume i , version 1.0 february 28 , 1997 683 applied-research - systematic-study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary for determining the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met . apportionment - a distribution made by omb of amounts available for obligation in an appropriation or fund account into amounts available for specified-time-periods , programs , activities , projects , objects , or combinations thereof . the apportioned-amount limits the obligations that may be incurred . ( omb circular a-34 ) appropriation -in most cases , appropriations are a form of budget-authority provided by law that permits federal-agencies to incur-obligations and make payments out of the treasury for specified-purposes . an appropriation usually follows enactment of authorizing-legislation . an appropriation-act is the most common means of providing-budget-authority , but in some cases the authorizing-legislation itself provides the budget-authority . assessments - enforceable-claims for nonexchange-revenue for which specific-amounts due have been determined and the person from whom the tax or duty is due has been identified . they include both selfassessments made by persons filing-tax-returns and assessments made by the collecting-entities as a result of audits , investigations , and litigation . although the term is normally used in connection with taxes , as used in this statement-assessments also include determinations of amounts due for any other kind of nonexchange-revenue . specifically excluded from the definition of assessments , as used in this statement , are compliance-assessments . compliance-assessments , as defined by irs and customs , do not represent financial-receivables . assets -tangible or intangible-items owned by the federal government which would have probable economic-benefits that can be obtained or controlled by a federal-government-entity .

'' cost-allocation - a method of assigning-costs to activities , outputs , or other cost-objects . the allocation-base used to assign a cost to objects is not necessarily the cause of the cost . for example , assigning the cost of power to machine-activities by machine-hours is an allocation because machine-hours are an indirect-measure of power consumption . cost-assignment - a process that identifies costs with activities , outputs , or other cost-objects . in a broad-sense , costs can be assigned to processes , activities , organizational-divisions , products , and services . there are three methods of cost-assignment : ( a ) directly tracing-costs wherever economically-feasible , ( b ) cause-and-effect , and ( c ) allocating-costs on a reasonable and consistent-basis . cost-benefit-analysis -the weighing of benefits against costs usually expressed as a ratio of dollar-benefits to dollar-costs for each of a variety of alternatives to provide a comparable-basis of choice among them .
