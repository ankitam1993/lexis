new york law journal survey : most law-students ca n't afford public-service thomas adcock 12-09-2002 for those worried about the indebtedness of young-attorneys -- and how this affects the future of government and public-interest-law -- fresh-anxiety arrived last month with a national-survey showing that two-thirds of today 's law-school-graduates can not afford to think about taking low-paying-jobs . mortgage-sized-tuition-debts , warned the report , have dire-consequences for the future of poverty-law-agencies and legal-departments in state and federal government . the 47-page report , '' from paper chase to money chase : law-school-debt diverts road to public-service , '' was sponsored by the partnership for public-service , equal-justice works and the national association for law placement . at the heart of the report was a survey of 1,622 third-year-law students at 117 campuses in 40 states and the district of columbia . among the findings : • nearly all students surveyed -- 94 percent -- borrow money for tuition . • while 39 percent of graduate-respondents showed significant-interest in working for the federal government , fewer than 3 percent accepted federal-job-offers . • most government-law-employers -- 68 percent -- reported-difficulty in recruiting young-attorneys . • nationally , the average monthly-payment to retire law-school-debt on a 10-year plan is $ 950 . • for 83 percent of student-respondents , $ 6,000 a year in loan-repayment-assistance could mean the difference between taking a high-paying-job in corporate-law versus the modest-salaries offered by federal-government-positions . in new york , salaries at public-interest-law agencies can be as low as $ 32,000 to start , but with many entry-level-jobs beginning at about $ 40,000 . staff-attorney-positions at city and federal-agencies in new york begin at slightly higher salaries . `` these [ debt ] problems blunt the desire to serve that is prevalent among law-school-graduates , and have negative-consequences for society as a whole , '' the report declared . `` low-income-households must negotiate legal-issues to satisfy their basic-needs for food , housing , health care , personal-safety and education . these needs go unfilled due to the limited-availability of public-interest-lawyers . `` at the same time , the federal government 's role in representing the nation in its regulation , policy-development and oversight-responsibilities demands the most skilled-lawyers , '' the report added . `` in the next five years , more than 50 percent of the federal [ attorney ] workforce may be eligible to retire . '' for the past decade , bar-associations in new york and across the country have been well aware of increases in the cost of attending law-school , increases that have briskly outpaced inflation in any other realm . yet only a half-dozen-states currently offer loan-forgiveness programs to graduates who agree to work for government or non-profit-agencies . the state-programs are economically-modest , as is the only loan-forgiveness-initiative on the near-horizon for new york , the `` student loan assistance for the public-interest , '' a program adopted last summer by new york state-bar-association when the house of delegates met in cooperstown . henry m. greenberg , a partner in the albany , n.y. , firm couch white who previously served 14 years in state government , was made chair of a standing state-bar committee assigned to work with the bar-foundation to put the plan into operation . `` hopefully , we 'll be up and running in 2003 , '' greenberg told the law journal . `` necessarily , it will be modest at first . you have to crawl before you walk . `` in the first year , i would imagine we would have approximately $ 25,000 to dispense in grants in the $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 range , '' he said . `` in relative-terms , and given the programs that exist in a few other states , this would put us in a comparable-position . '' but greenberg could not identify the source of the initial $ 25,000 . `` we 're looking for it , but we do n't have it in hand , '' he said . `` this program is going to have to go out and raise money and have an endowment . every segment of the profession has an interest in trying to ameliorate this [ student-debt ] problem . `` this new and relatively artificial-wall to public-law-service participation needs to be addressed . the problem is only getting worse . '' with reference to increasing law-school-tuition and the boomer population of public-service-lawyers nearing-retirement-age , greenberg added , `` we 're dealing with doubledigit-inflation as far as the eye can see , and that 's pushing so many young-lawyers to private-practice -- a certain-type of large-firm-practice with salaries of $ 120,000 to $ 160,000 . and who 's going to replace these [ public-service-lawyers ] ? you can lose institutional-memory and expertise . '' city bar report a group at the association of the bar of the city of new york , meanwhile , has been discussing-student-debt for six months . lawrence grosberg , a new york law-school professor and chair of the city bar 's legal-education and admission to the bar committee , said he expects to issue a draft-report on loan-forgiveness within three months . `` we 're preparing a report to describe the depth of the problem , '' said grosberg . though he would not disclose specific-ideas on implementing-debt-relief in order to make public-law a viable-option for young-attorneys , he added , `` it 's an enormous problem . '' the american bar-association 's commission on loan repayment and forgiveness is `` alive and well , '' according to its co-chair , frank m. coffin , senior-judge at the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit in portland , me . he said the commission was to meet in phoenix on dec. 7 to finalize its report for the aba 's general meeting next-spring . in a telephone interview , judge coffin provided no details of the commission 's thinking , but said it would make recommendations in three broad-areas : federal , state and campus . `` we 're trying to liberalize the [ federal ] stafford and perkins loan-programs , '' he said . `` we 're preparing a state-tool-kit of various-options available , based on the experience of states that already have [ loan-forgiveness ] plans . and we 're trying to inculcate a wider acceptance of plans at law-schools . '' judge coffin has personal-reasons for agreeing with the alarm sounded by the `` paper chase to money chase '' report . `` when i have a law-clerk leave me to go into a big-firm , that clerk starts off earning more money than i do , '' he said . `` i do n't think crisis would be overstating the case . '' in view of public-spirited young-attorneys forced to take high-paying-jobs at private-firms , would an aba program ask those same firms to help fund-loan-forgiveness in the interest of government or poverty-law career options ? `` this is within our vision , but i doubt if we could do it this year , '' said judge coffin . `` we recognize that firms are being called upon to do not just this [ loan-forgiveness ] but many other charitable-things . '' law-school-deans , to be sure , will soon be confronted with all these recommendations from the bar-groups . meanwhile , at least two campus-officials have been outspoken on the subject of student-debt and the zooming-rise in tuition-costs . kristin booth glen , dean of the city university of new york school of law , likened-competition for top-students to the seductive-practices of credit-card-companies . `` there 's a sort of bidding-war going on , with law-schools offering ever-increasing financial-packages -- most of it loans , '' said dean glen . `` law-schools have a real-obligation to be extremely specific about what kinds of debt-burdens-students are going to have , and to discourage borrowing whenever possible . '' joseph d. harbaugh , dean of the shepard broad law center at nova southeastern university in fort lauderdale , fla. , is likewise concerned about his graduates ' debt-burdens . he tells students : `` if you live like a lawyer while you 're a law-student , you're definitely going to live like a student when you 're a lawyer . '' dean harbaugh expressed-skepticism about the cent-ral-thesis of `` paper chase to money chase , '' that debt-strapped young-attorneys can not afford public-law-careers . `` my sense is that there are a lot of applicants for [ public-service ] jobs , '' said dean harbaugh . indeed , stephen m. aronson , attorney-recruitment-coordinator at the new york city human-resources administration , said he has no problem finding available young-lawyers . his problem , he said , is the current hiring-freeze imposed on all city-agencies . `` we do n't have any jobs right now , but i interview people . when this freeze lifts , i want to stay in touch , '' said aronson . `` i just got back from a job-fair in washington where i identified about two dozen very qualified young-attorneys . '' there remains the question of exactly why law-school-tuitions have boomed during the past 10 year , a 76-percent-increase among private-schools , according to the report , and 140 percent for in-state-residents of public-schools . `` law-schools , '' said the executive director of a major new york public-law-agency who asked to remain anonymous , `` are profit-centers .
