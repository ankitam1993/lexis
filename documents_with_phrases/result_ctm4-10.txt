section 4 quality-assurance 4.1 introduction 4.1.1 development and maintenance of a toxicity-test-laboratory quality-assurance ( qa ) program ( usepa , 1991b ) requires an ongoing-commitment by laboratory-management . each toxicity-test-laboratory should ( 1 ) appoint a quality-assurance-officer with the responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a qa program , ( 2 ) prepare a quality-assurance-plan with stated data-quality objectives ( dqos ) , ( 3 ) prepare written descriptions of laboratory standard-operating-procedures ( sops ) for culturing , toxicity-testing , instrument-calibration , sample-chain-of-custody procedures , laboratory sample tracking-system , glassware-cleaning , etc. , and ( 4 ) provide an adequate , qualified technical-staff for culturing and toxicity-testing the organisms , and suitable-space and equipment to assure reliable-data . 4.1.2 qa practices for toxicity-testing laboratories must address all activities that affect the quality of the final effluent-toxicity-data , such as : ( 1 ) effluent-sampling and handling ; ( 2 ) the source and condition of the test-organisms ; ( 3 ) condition of equipment ; ( 4 ) test-conditions ; ( 5 ) instrument-calibration ; ( 6 ) replication ; ( 7 ) use of reference-toxicants ; ( 8 ) record keeping ; and ( 9 ) data-evaluation . 4.1.3 quality-control practices , on the other hand , consist of the more focused , routine , day-to-day-activities carried out within the scope of the overall qa program . for more detailed-discussion of quality-assurance and general-guidance on good-laboratory practices and laboratory-evaluation related to toxicity-testing , see fda ( 1978 ) ; usepa ( 1979d ) ; usepa ( 1980b ) ; usepa ( 1980c ) ; usepa ( 1991c ) ; dewoskin ( 1984 ) ; and taylor ( 1987 ) . 4.1.4 guidelines for the evaluation of laboratory performing-toxicity-tests and laboratory-evaluation-criteria are found in usepa ( 1991c ) . 4.2 facilities , equipment , and test-chambers 4.2.1 separate-test-organism culturing and toxicity-testing-areas should be provided to avoid possible-loss of cultures due to cross-contamination . ventilation-systems should be designed and operated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemical analysis-laboratories or sample-storage and preparation-areas into organism culturing or testing-areas , and from testing and sample-preparation-areas into culture-rooms . 4.2.2 laboratory and toxicity-test temperature-control equipment must be adequate to maintain recommended-test-water temperatures . recommended materials must be used in the fabrication of the test-equipment which comes in contact with the effluent ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies ; and specific toxicity-test-method ) . 4.3 test-organisms 4.3.1 the test-organisms used in the procedures described in this manual are the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus ; the inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina ; the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia ; the sea-urchin , arbacia-punctulata ; and the red-macroalga , champia-parvula . the organisms used should be disease-free and appear healthy , behave normally , feed well , and have low-mortality in cultures , during holding , and in test-control . test-organisms should be positively identified to species ( see section 6 , test-organisms ) . 4.4 laboratory-water used for culturing and test-dilution-water 4.4.1 the quality of water used for test-organism-culturing and for dilution-water used in toxicity-tests is extremely-important . water for these two uses should come from the same source . the dilution-water used in effluent-toxicity-tests will depend on the objectives of the study and logistical-constraints , as discussed in section 7 , dilution-water . the dilution-water used in the toxicity-tests may be natural-seawater , hypersaline-brine ( 100‰ ) prepared from natural-seawater , or artificial-seawater prepared from commercial-sea-salts , such as forty fathoms® or hw marinemix® , if recommended in the method . gp2 synthetic-seawater , made from reagent-grade chemical salts ( 30‰ ) in conjunction with natural-seawater , may also be used if recommended . hypersaline-brine and artificial-seawater can be used with champia-parvula only if they are accompanied by at least 50 % natural-seawater . types of water are discussed in section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies . water used for culturing and test-dilution-water should be analyzed for toxic-metals and organics at least annually or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting-minimum acceptability-criteria for control-survival and reproduction or growth . the concentration of the metals , al , as , cr , co , cu , fe , pb , ni , zn , expressed as total-metal , should not exceed 1 µg/l each , and cd , hg , and ag , expressed as total-metal , should not exceed 100 ng/l each . total-organochlorine-pesticides plus pcbs should be less than 50 ng/l ( apha , 1992 ) . pesticide-concentrations should not exceed usepa's national ambient water-quality chronic-criteria-values where available . 4.5 effluent and receiving-water sampling and handling 4.5.1 sample holding-times and temperatures of effluent-samples collected for on-site and off-site-testing must conform to conditions described in section 8 , effluent and receiving-water sampling , sample handling , and sample preparation for toxicity-tests . 4.6 test-conditions 4.6.1 water-temperature and salinity should be maintained within the limits specified for each test . the temperature of test-solutions must be measured by placing the thermometer or probe directly into the test-solutions , or by placing the thermometer in equivalent-volumes of water in surrogate-vessels positioned at appropriate-locations among the test-vessels . temperature should be recorded continuously in at least one vessel during the duration of each test . test-solution temperatures should be maintained within the limits specified for each test . do concentrations and ph should be checked at the beginning of the test and daily throughout the test-period . 4.7 quality of test-organisms 4.7.1 the health of test-organisms is primarily assessed by the performance ( survival , growth , and/or reproduction ) of organisms in control-treatments of individual-tests . the health and sensitivity of test-organisms is also assessed by reference-toxicant testing . in addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of test-organisms , reference-toxicant testing is used to initially demonstrate acceptable-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.15 ) and to document ongoing-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.16 ) . 4.7.2 regardless of the source of test-organisms ( in-house cultures or purchased from external-suppliers ) , the testing-laboratory must perform at least one acceptable-reference-toxicant test per month for each toxicity-test-method conducted in that month ( subsection 4.16 ) . if a test-method is conducted only monthly , or less frequently , a reference-toxicant test must be performed concurrently with each effluent-toxicity-test . 4.7.3 when acute or short-term-chronic-toxicity tests are performed with effluents or receiving-waters using-test-organisms obtained from outside the test-laboratory , concurrent-toxicity tests of the same type must be performed with a reference-toxicant , unless the test-organism supplier provides control-chart-data from at least the last five monthly-short-term chronic-toxicity-tests using the same reference-toxicant and test-conditions ( see section 6 , test-organisms ) . 4.7.4 the supplier should certify the species-identification of the test-organisms , and provide the taxonomic-reference ( citation and page ) or name ( s ) of the taxonomic-expert ( s ) consulted . 4.7.5 if a routine-reference toxicant-test fails to meet test-acceptability-criteria , then the reference-toxicant test must be immediately repeated . 4.8 food quality 4.8.1 the nutritional-quality of the food used in culturing and testing-fish and invertebrates is an important-factor in the quality of the toxicity-test-data . this is especially-true for the unsaturated fatty-acid-content of brine-shrimp-nauplii , artemia . problems with the nutritional-suitability of the food will be reflected in the survival , growth , and reproduction of the test-organisms in cultures and toxicity-tests . artemia-cysts and other foods must be obtained as described in section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies . 4.8.2 problems with the nutritional-suitability of food will be reflected in the survival , growth , and reproduction of the test-organisms in cultures and toxicity-tests . if a batch of food is suspected to be defective , the performance of organisms fed with the new food can be compared with the performance of organisms fed with a food of known quality in side-by-side-tests . if the food is used for culturing , its suitability should be determined using a short-term-chronic-test which will determine the affect of food quality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant-test species in culture , using four replicates with each food-source . where applicable , foods used only in chronic-toxicity-tests can be compared with a food of known quality in side-by-side , multi-concentration-chronic-tests , using the reference-toxicant regularly employed in the laboratory qa program . 4.8.3 new batches of food used in culturing and testing should be analyzed for toxic-organics and metals or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting-minimum acceptability-criteria for control-survival and reproduction or growth . if the concentration of total-organochlorine-pesticides exceeds 0.15 µg/g wet-weight , or the concentration of total-organochlorine-pesticides plus pcbs exceeds 0.30 µg/g wet-weight , or toxic-metals ( al , as , cr , cd , cu , pb , ni , zn , expressed as total-metal ) exceed 20 µg/g wet-weight , the food should not be used ( for analytical-methods , see aoac , 1990 ; and usda , 1989 ) . 4.84 for foods ( e.g. , yct ) which are used to culture and test-organisms , the quality of the food should meet the requirements for the laboratory-water used for culturing and test-dilution-water as described in section 4.4 above . 4.9 acceptability of chronic-toxicity-tests 4.9.1 the results of the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus , inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina , or mysid , mysidopsis-bahia , tests are acceptable if survival in the controls is 80 % or greater . the sea-urchin , arbacia-punctulata , test requires control-egg-fertilization equal to or exceeding 70 % . however , greater than 90 % fertilization may result in masking toxic responses . the red-macroalga , champia-parvula , test is acceptable if survival is 100 % , and the mean-number of cystocarps per plant should equal or exceed 10 . if the sheepshead-minnow , cyprindon variegatus , larval-survival and growth-test is begun with less-than-24-h old larvae , the mean dry-weight of the surviving-larvae in the control-chambers at the end of the test must equal or exceed 0.60 mg , if the weights are determined immediately , or 0.50 mg if the larvae are preserved in a 4 % formalin or 70 % ethanol-solution . if the inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina , larval-survival and growth-test is begun with larvae seven days old , the mean dry-weight of the surviving-larvae in the control-chambers at the end of the test must equal or exceed 0.50 mg , if the weights are determined immediately , or 0.43 mg if the larvae are preserved in a 4 % formalin or 70 % ethanol-solution . the mean mysid dry-weight of survivors must be at least 0.20 mg. automatic or hourly-feeding will generally provide control-mysids with a dry-weight of 0.30 mg. at least 50 % of the females should bear eggs at the end of the test , but mysid-fecundity is not a factor in test-acceptability . however , fecundity must equal or exceed 50 % to be used as an endpoint in the test . if these criteria are not met , the test must be repeated . 4.9.2 an individual-test may be conditionally-acceptable if temperature , do , and other specified-conditions fall outside specifications , depending on the degree of the departure and the objectives of the tests ( see test-conditions and test-acceptability-criteria summaries ) . the acceptability of the test will depend on the experience and professional-judgment of the laboratory-investigator and the reviewing-staff of the regulatory-authority . any deviation from test-specifications must be noted when reporting-data from a test . 4.10 analytical-methods 4.10.1 routine-chemical and physical-analyses for culture and dilution-water , food , and test-solutions must include established quality-assurance-practices outlined in usepa methods-manuals ( usepa , 1979a and usepa , 1979b ) . 4.10.2 reagent-containers should be dated and catalogued when received from the supplier , and the shelf-life should not be exceeded . also , working-solutions should be dated when prepared , and the recommended shelf-life should be observed . 4.11 calibration and standardization 4.11.1 instruments used for routine-measurements of chemical and physical-parameters , such as ph , do , temperature , conductivity , and salinity , must be calibrated and standardized according to instrument-manufacturers-procedures as indicated in the general-section on quality-assurance ( see usepa methods 150.1 , 360.1 , 170.1 , and 120.1 in usepa , 1979b ) . calibration-data are recorded in a permanent-log-book . 4.11.2 wet-chemical-methods used to measure hardness , alkalinity , and total residual-chlorine , must be standardized prior to use each day according to the procedures for those specific usepa methods ( see usepa methods 130.2 and 310.1 in usepa , 1979b ) . 4.12 replication and test-sensitivity 4.12.1 the sensitivity of the tests will depend in part on the number of replicates per concentration , the significance-level selected , and the type of statistical-analysis . if the variability remains constant , the sensitivity of the test will increase as the number of replicates is increased . the minimum recommended-number of replicates varies with the objectives of the test and the statistical-method used for analysis of the data . 4.13 variability in toxicity-test-results 4.13.1 factors which can affect test-success and precision include : ( 1 ) the experience and skill of the laboratory-analyst ; ( 2 ) test-organism-age , condition , and sensitivity ; ( 3 ) dilution-water-quality ; ( 4 ) temperature-control ; ( 5 ) and the quality and quantity of food provided . the results will depend upon the species used and the strain or source of the test-organisms , and test-conditions , such as temperature , do , food , and water-quality . the repeatability or precision of toxicity-tests is also a function of the number of test-organisms used at each toxicant-concentration . jensen ( 1972 ) discussed the relationship between sample-size ( number of fish ) and the standard-error of the test , and considered 20 fish per concentration as optimum for probit analysis . 4.14 test-precision 4.14.1 the ability of the laboratory-personnel to obtain consistent , precise-results must be demonstrated with reference-toxicants before they attempt to measure effluent-toxicity . the single-laboratory-precision of each type of test to be used in a laboratory should be determined by performing at least five or more tests with a reference-toxicant . 4.14.2 test-precision can be estimated by using the same strain of organisms under the same test-conditions , and employing a known toxicant , such as a reference-toxicant . 4.14.3 interlaboratory-precision-data from a 1991 study of chronic-toxicity-tests using two reference-toxicants with the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia , and the inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina , is listed in table 1 . table 2-shows-interlaboratory precision-data from a study of three chronic-toxicity-test methods using effluent , receiving-water , and reference-toxicant sample-types ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2001b ) . for the mysidopsis-bahia and the cyprinodon-variegatus test-methods , the effluent-sample was a municipal-wastewater spiked with kcl , the receiving-water-sample was a river-water spiked with kcl , and the reference-toxicant sample was bioassay-grade forty fathoms® synthetic-seawater spiked with kcl . for the menidia-beryllina test-method , the effluent-sample was an industrial-wastewater spiked with cuso4 , the receiving-water-sample was a natural-seawater spiked with cuso4 , and the reference-toxicant sample was bioassay-grade forty fathoms® synthetic-seawater spiked with cuso4 . additional-precision-data for each of the tests described in this manual are presented in the sections describing the individual-test-methods . 4.14.4 additional information on toxicity-test-precision is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxic control ( see pp . 2-4 , and 11-15 in usepa , 1991a ) . 4.14.5 in cases where the test-data are used in probit analysis or other point-estimation-techniques ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis ) , precision can be described by the mean , standard-deviation , and relative-standard-deviation ( percent-coefficient of variation , or cv ) of the calculated endpoints from the replicated-tests . in cases where the test-data are used in the linear-interpolation-method , precision can be estimated by empirical-confidence-intervals derived by using the icpin method ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis ) . however , in cases where the results are reported in terms of the no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) and lowest-observed-effect-concentration ( loec ) ( see section 9 , chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis ) , precision can only be described by listing the noec-loec interval for each test . it is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly used statistic . however , when all tests of the same toxicant yield the same noec-loec interval , maximum-precision has been attained . the '' true '' no-effect-concentration could fall anywhere within the interval , noec ± ( loec minus noec ) . 4.14.6 it should be noted here that the dilution-factor selected for a test determines the width of the noec-loec interval and the inherent-maximum-precision of the test . as the absolute-value of the dilution-factor-decreases , the width of the noec-loec interval increases , and the inherent-maximum-precision of the test decreases . when a dilution-factor of 0.3 is used , the noec could be considered to have a relative-uncertainty as high as ± 300 % . with a dilution-factor of 0.5 , the noec could be considered to have a relative-variability of ± 100 % . as a result of the variability of different-dilution-factors , usepa recommends the use of a $ 0.5 dilution-factor . other factors which can affect test-precision include : test-organism-age , condition , and sensitivity ; temperature-control ; and feeding . table 1 . national interlaboratory-study

1 from epa 's wet interlaboratory-variability-study ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2001b ) . 2 represents the number of valid-tests ( i.e. , those that met-test acceptability-criteria ) that were used in the analysis of precision . invalid-tests were not used . 3 cvs based on total-interlaboratory-variability ( including both within-laboratory and between-laboratory-components of variability ) and averaged across sample-types . ic25s or ic50s were pooled for all laboratories to calculate the cv for each sample-type . the resulting-cvs were then averaged across sample-types . 4.15 demonstrating acceptable-laboratory-performance 4.15.1 it is a laboratory 's responsibility to demonstrate its ability to obtain consistent , precise-results with reference-toxicants before it performs toxicity-tests with effluents for permit-compliance-purposes . to meet this requirement , the intralaboratory-precision , expressed as percent-coefficient of variation ( cv % ) , of each type of test to be used in a laboratory should be determined by performing five or more tests with different-batches of test-organisms , using the same reference-toxicant , at the same concentrations , with the same test-conditions ( i.e. , the same test-duration , type of dilution-water , age of test-organisms , feeding , etc . ) , and same data-analysis-methods . a reference-toxicant concentration-series ( 0.5 or higher ) should be selected that will consistently provide partial-mortalities at two or more concentrations . 4.16 documenting ongoing-laboratory-performance 4.16.1 satisfactory-laboratory-performance is demonstrated by performing at least one acceptable-test per month with a reference-toxicant for each toxicity-test-method conducted in the laboratory during that month . for a given test-method , successive-tests must be performed with the same reference-toxicant , at the same concentrations , in the same dilution-water , using the same data-analysis-methods . precision may vary with the test-species , reference-toxicant , and type of test . each laboratory 's reference toxicity-data will reflect conditions unique to that facility , including-dilution-water , culturing , and other variables ; however , each laboratory 's reference-toxicity-results should reflect good repeatability . 4.16.2 a control-chart should be prepared for each combination of reference-toxicant , test-species , test-conditions , and endpoints . toxicity-endpoints from five or six tests are adequate for establishing the control-charts . successive-toxicity-endpoints ( noecs , ic25s , lc50s , etc . ) should be plotted and examined to determine if the results ( x1 ) are within prescribed-limits ( figure 1 ) . the chart should plot logarithm of concentration on the vertical-axis against the date of the test or test number on the horizontal-axis . the types of control-charts illustrated ( see usepa , 1979a ) are used to evaluate the cumulative-trend of results from a series of samples , thus-reference toxicant-test-results should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of individual-effluent or receiving-water-tests . for endpoints that are point-estimates ( lc50s and ic25s ) , the cumulative-mean ( x¯ ) and upper and lower control-limits ( ± 2s ) are re-calculated with each successive-test-result . endpoints from hypothesis-tests ( noec , noaec ) from each test are plotted directly on the control-chart . the control-limits would consist of one concentration-interval above and below the concentration representing the central-tendency . after two years of data-collection , or a minimum of 20-data-points , the control-chart should be maintained using only the 20 most recent-data-points . 4.16.3 laboratories should compare the calculated cv ( i.e. , standard-deviation / mean ) of the ic25 for the 20 most recent-data-points to the distribution of laboratory-cvs reported nationally for reference-toxicant testing ( table 3-2 in usepa , 2000b ) . if the calculated cv exceeds the 75th-percentile of cvs reported nationally , the laboratory should use the 75th and 90th-percentiles to calculate warning and control-limits , respectively , and the laboratory should investigate options for reducing-variability . note : because noecs can only be a fixed-number of discrete-values , the mean , standard-deviation , and cv can not be interpreted and applied in the same way that these descriptive-statistics are interpreted and applied for continuous-variables such as the ic25 or lc50 . 4.16.4 the outliers , which are values falling outside the upper and lower control-limits , and trends of increasing or decreasing sensitivity , are readily identified . in the case of endpoints that are point-estimates ( lc50s and ic25s ) , at the 0.05 probability level , one in 20 tests would be expected to fall outside of the control-limits by chance alone . if more than one out of 20 reference-toxicant tests fall outside the control-limits , the laboratory should investigate sources of variability , take corrective-actions to reduce identified sources of variability , and perform an additional-reference toxicant-test during the same month . control-limits for the noecs will also be exceeded occasionally , regardless of how well a laboratory performs . in those instances when the laboratory can document the cause for the outlier ( e.g. , operator-error , culture-health or test-system failure ) , the outlier should be excluded from the future calculations of the control-limits . if two or more consecutive-tests do not fall within the control-limits , the results must be explained and the reference-toxicant test must be immediately repeated . actions taken to correct the problem must be reported . 4.16.5 if the toxicity-value from a given test with a reference-toxicant fall well outside the expected-range for the test-organisms when using the standard-dilution-water and other test-conditions , the laboratory should investigate sources of variability , take corrective-actions to reduce identified sources of variability , and perform an additional-reference toxicant-test during the same month . performance should improve with experience , and the control-limits for endpoints that are point-estimates should gradually narrow . however , control-limits of ± 2s will be exceeded 5 % of the time by chance alone , regardless of how well a laboratory performs . highly proficient-laboratories which develop very narrow-control-limits may be unfairly penalized if a test-result which falls just outside the control-limits is rejected de facto . for this reason , the width of the control-limits should be considered in determining whether or not a reference-toxicant test-result falls `` well '' outside the expected-range . the width of the control-limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated cv ( i.e. , standard-deviation / mean ) of the ic25 for the 20 most recent-data-points to the distribution of laboratory-cvs reported nationally for reference-toxicant testing ( table 3-2 in usepa , 2000b ) . in determining whether or not a reference-toxicant test-result falls `` well '' outside the expected-range , the result also may be compared with upper and lower bounds for ± 3s , as any result outside these control-limits would be expected to occur by chance only 1 out of 100 tests ( environment canada , 1990 ) . when a result from a reference-toxicant test is outside the 99 % confidence-intervals , the laboratory must conduct an immediate-investigation to assess the possible-causes for the outlier . 4.16.6 reference-toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of individual-effluent or receiving-water-tests . reference-toxicant testing is used for evaluating the health and sensitivity of organisms over time and for documenting initial and ongoing-laboratory-performance . while reference-toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto criterion for test-rejection , effluent and receiving-water-test results should be reviewed and interpreted in the light of reference-toxicant test results . the reviewer should consider the degree to which the reference-toxicant test-result fell outside of control-chart-limits , the width of the limits , the direction of the deviation ( toward increased test-organism sensitivity or toward decreased-test organism-sensitivity ) , the test-conditions of both the effluent-test and the reference-toxicant test , and the objective of the test . 4.17 reference-toxicants 4.17.1 reference-toxicants such as sodium-chloride ( nacl ) , potassium-chloride ( kcl ) , cadmium-chloride ( cdcl2 ) , copper-sulfate ( cuso4 ) , sodium-dodecyl-sulfate ( sds ) , and potassium-dichromate ( k2cr2o7 ) , are suitable for use in the npdes program and other agency-programs requiring aquatic-toxicity-tests . emsl-cincinnati plans to release usepa-certified-solutions of cadmium and copper for use as reference-toxicants , through cooperative-research and development-agreements with commercial-suppliers , and will continue to develop additional-reference-toxicants for future-release . standard reference-materials can be obtained from commercial-supply-houses , or can be prepared-inhouse using-reagent grade-chemicals . the regulatory-agency should be consulted before reference-toxicant ( s ) are selected and used . 4.18 record keeping 4.18.1 proper-record keeping is important . a complete-file must be maintained for each individual-toxicity-test or group of tests on closely related samples . this file must contain a record of the sample-chain-of-custody ; a copy of the sample-log-sheet ; the original-bench-sheets for the test-organism-responses during the toxicity-test ( s ) ; chemical-analysis-data on the sample ( s ) ; detailed records of the test-organisms used in the test ( s ) , such as species , source , age , date of receipt , and other pertinent-information relating to their history and health ; information on the calibration of equipment and instruments ; test-conditions employed ; and results of reference-toxicant tests . laboratory-data should be recorded on a real-time-basis to prevent the loss of information or inadvertent-introduction of errors into the record . original-data sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory-personnel performing the tests . 4.18.2 the regulatory-authority should retain records pertaining to discharge-permits . permittees are required to retain records pertaining to permit-applications and compliance for a minimum of 3 years [ 40 cfr 122.41 ( j ) ( 2 ) ] . section 5 facilities , equipment , and supplies 5.1 general requirements 5.1.1 effluent-toxicity-tests may be performed in a fixed or mobile-laboratory . facilities must include equipment for rearing and/or holding-organisms . culturing-facilities for test-organisms may be desirable in fixed-laboratories which perform large numbers of tests . temperature-control can be achieved using circulating-water-baths , heat-exchangers , or environmental-chambers . water used for rearing , holding , acclimating , and testing-organisms may be natural-seawater or water made up from hypersaline-brine derived from natural-seawater , or water made up from reagent-grade-chemicals ( gp2 ) or commercial ( forty fathoms® or hw marinemix® ) artificial-sea-salts when specifically recommended in the method . air used for aeration must be free of oil and toxic-vapors . oil-free air-pumps should be used where possible . particulates can be removed from the air using balston® grade bx or equivalent-filters , and oil and other organic-vapors can be removed using activated carbon-filters ( balston® , c-1 filter , or equivalent ) . 5.1.2 the facilities must be well ventilated and free of fumes . laboratory-ventilation-systems should be checked to ensure that return-air from chemistry-laboratories and/or sample handling-areas is not circulated to test-organism culture-rooms or toxicity-test-rooms , or that air from toxicity-test-rooms does not contaminate-culture-areas . sample preparation , culturing , and toxicity-testing-areas should be separated to avoid cross-contamination of cultures or toxicity-test-solutions with toxic-fumes . air-pressure differentials between such rooms should not result in a net-flow of potentially contaminated air to sensitive-areas through open or loosely-fitting-doors . organisms should be shielded from external-disturbances . 5.1.3 materials used for exposure-chambers , tubing , etc. , which come in contact with the effluent and dilution-water , should be carefully chosen . tempered glass and perfluorocarbon-plastics ( teflon® ) should be used whenever possible to minimize sorption and leaching of toxic-substances . these materials may be reused following-decontamination . containers made of plastics , such as polyethylene , polypropylene , polyvinyl-chloride , tygon® , etc. , may be used as test-chambers or to ship , store , and transfer effluents and receiving-waters , but they should not be reused unless absolutely-necessary , because they might carry over adsorbed-toxicants from one test to another , if reused . however , these containers may be repeatedly reused for storing-uncontaminated waters such as deionized or laboratory-prepared-dilution-waters and receiving-waters . glass or disposable-polystyrene-containers can be used as test-chambers . the use of large ( $ 20 l ) glass-carboys is discouraged for safety-reasons . 5.1.4 new plastic-products of a type not previously used should be tested for toxicity before initial-use by exposing the test-organisms in the test-system where the material is used . equipment ( pumps , valves , etc . ) which can not be discarded after each use because of cost , must be decontaminated according to the cleaning procedures listed below ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies , subsection 5.3.2 ) . fiberglass , in addition to the previously mentioned-materials , can be used for holding , acclimating , and dilution-water storage-tanks , and in the water-delivery-system , but once contaminated with pollutants the fiberglass should not be reused . all material should be flushed or rinsed thoroughly with the test-media before using in the test . 5.1.5 copper , galvanized-material , rubber , brass , and lead must not come in contact with culturing , holding , acclimation , or dilution-water , or with effluent-samples and test-solutions . some materials , such as several-types of neoprene-rubber ( commonly used for stoppers ) may be toxic and should be tested before use . 5.1.6 silicone-adhesive used to construct glass-test-chambers absorbs some organochlorine and organophosphorus-pesticides , which are difficult to remove . therefore , as little of the adhesive as possible should be in contact with water . extra-beads of adhesive inside the containers should be removed . 5.2 test-chambers 5.2.1 test-chamber size and shape are varied according to size of the test-organism . requirements are specified in each toxicity-test-method . 5.3 cleaning test-chambers and laboratory apparatus 5.3.1 new plasticware used for sample-collection or organism exposure-vessels generally does not require thorough-cleaning before use . it is sufficient to rinse new sample-containers once with dilution-water before use . new , disposable , plastic-test chambers may have to be rinsed with dilution-water before use . new glassware must be soaked overnight in 10 % acid ( see below ) and also should be rinsed well in deionized-water and seawater . 5.3.2 all non-disposable-sample-containers , test-vessels , pumps , tanks , and other equipment that has come in contact with effluent must be washed after use to remove surface-contaminants , as described below . 1 . soak 15 minutes in tap-water and scrub with detergent , or clean in an automatic-dishwasher . 2 . rinse twice with tap-water . 3 . carefully rinse once with fresh dilute ( 10 % v : v ) hydrochloric-acid or nitric-acid to remove scale , metals and bases . to prepare a 10 % solution of acid , add 10 ml of concentrated-acid to 90 ml of deionized-water . 4 . rinse twice with deionized-water . 5 . rinse once with full-strength , pesticide-grade-acetone to remove organic-compounds ( use a fume-hood or canopy ) . 6 . rinse three times with deionized-water . 5.3.3 all test-chambers and equipment must be thoroughly rinsed with the dilution-water immediately prior to use in each test . 5.4 apparatus and equipment for culturing and toxicity-tests 5.4.1 apparatus and equipment-requirements for culturing and toxicity-tests are specified in each toxicity-test-method . also , see usepa , 2002a . 5.4.2 water purification-system 5.4.2.1 a good-quality , laboratory-grade deionized-water , providing a resistance of 18 megaohm-cm , must be available in the laboratory and in sufficient-quantity for laboratory-needs . deionized-water may be obtained from millipore® , milli-q® , millipore® qpak™2 or equivalent-system . if large-quantities of high quality deionized-water are needed , it may be advisable to supply the laboratory-grade water deionizer with preconditioned-water from a culligan® , continental® , or equivalent mixed-bed-water-treatment system . 5.5 reagents and consumable-materials 5.5.1 sources of food for culture and toxicity-tests 1 . brine-shrimp , artemia sp . cysts -- many commercial-sources of brine-shrimp-cysts are available . 2 . frozen-adult brine-shrimp , artemia -- available from most pet-supply-shops or other commercial-sources . 3 . flake-food -- tetramin® and bioril® or equivalent are available at most pet-supply-shops . 4 . feeding-requirements and other specific-foods are indicated in the specific toxicity-test-method . 5.5.1.1 all food should be tested for nutritional-suitability and chemically analyzed for organochlorine-pesticides , pcbs , and toxic-metals ( see section 4 , quality-assurance ) . 5.5.2 reagents and consumable-materials are specified in each toxicity-test-method . also , see section 4 , quality-assurance . 5.6 test-organisms 5.6.1 test-organisms are obtained from inhouse-cultures or commercial-suppliers ( see specific toxicity-test-method ; sections 4 , quality-assurance and 6 , test-organisms ) . 5.7 supplies 5.7.1 see toxicity-test-methods ( see sections 11-16 ) for specific-supplies . section 6 test-organisms 6.1 test-species 6.1.1 the species used in characterizing the chronic-toxicity of effluents and/or receiving-waters will depend on the requirements of the regulatory-authority and the objectives of the test . it is essential that good-quality test-organisms be readily-available throughout the year from inhouse or commercial-sources to meet npdes monitoring-requirements . the organisms used in toxicity-tests must be identified to species . if there is any doubt as to the identity of the test-organisms , representative-specimens should be sent to a taxonomic-expert to confirm the identification . 6.1.2 toxicity-test-conditions and culture-methods for the species listed in subsection 6.1.3 are provided in this manual ( also , see usepa , 2002a ) . 6.1.3 the organisms used in the short-term-tests described in this manual are the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus ; the inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina ; the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia ; the sea-urchin , arbacia-punctulata ; and the red-macroalga , champia-parvula . 6.1.4 some states have developed culturing and testing-methods for indigenous-species that may be as sensitive or more sensitive , than the species recommended in subsection 6.1.3 . however , usepa allows the use of indigenous-species only where state-regulations require their use or prohibit importation of the species in subsection 6.1.3 . where state-regulations prohibit importation of non-native-fishes or use of the recommended test-species , permission must be requested from the appropriate-state-agency prior to their use . 6.1.5 where states have developed culturing and testing-methods for indigenous-species other than those recommended in this manual , data comparing the sensitivity of the substitute-species and one or more of the recommended-species must be obtained in side-by-side toxicity-tests with reference-toxicants and/or effluents , to ensure that the species selected are at least as sensitive as the recommended-species . these data must be submitted to the permitting-authority ( state or region ) if required . usepa acknowledges that reference-toxicants prepared from pure-chemicals may not always be representative of effluents . however , because of the observed and/or potential-variability in the quality and toxicity of effluents , it is not possible to specify a representative effluent . 6.1.6 guidance for the selection of test-organisms where the salinity of the effluent and/or receiving-water requires special-consideration is provided in the technical-support document for water quality-based toxics control ( usepa , 1991a ) . 1 . where the salinity of the receiving-water is < 1‰ , freshwater-organisms are used regardless of the salinity of the effluent . 2 . where the salinity of the receiving-water is $ 1‰ , the choice of organisms depends on state water-quality standards and/or permit-requirements . 6.2 sources of test-organisms 6.2.1 the test-organisms recommended in this manual can be cultured in the laboratory using-culturing and handling-methods for each organism described in the respective test-method sections . also , see usepa ( 2002a ) . 6.2.2 inhouse-cultures should be established wherever it is cost effective . if inhouse-cultures can not be maintained or it is not cost effective , test-organisms should be purchased from experienced commercial-suppliers ( see usepa , 1993b ) . 6.2.3 sheepshead-minnows , inland silversides , mysids , and sea urchins may be purchased from commercial-suppliers . however , some of these organisms ( e.g. , adult-sheepshead minnows or adult inland silversides ) may not always be available from commercial-suppliers and may have to be collected in the field and brought back to the laboratory for spawning to obtain eggs and larvae . 6.2.4 if , because of their source , there is any uncertainty concerning the identity of the organisms , it is advisable to have them examined by a taxonomic-specialist to confirm their identification . for detailed-guidance on identification , see the individual-toxicity-test methods . 6.2.5 feral ( natural occurring , wild caught ) organisms 6.2.5.1 the use of test-organisms taken from the receiving-water has strong-appeal , and would seem to be the logical-approach . however , it is generally-impractical and not recommended for the following-reasons : 1 . sensitive-organisms may not be present in the receiving-water because of previous-exposure to the effluent or other pollutants . 2 . it is often-difficult to collect organisms of the required-age and quality from the receiving-water . 3 . most states require collection-permits , which may be difficult to obtain . therefore , it is usually more cost effective to culture the organisms in the laboratory or obtain them from private , state , or federal-sources . fish such as sheepshead-minnows and silversides , and invertebrates such as mysids , are easily reared in the laboratory or purchased . 4 . the required qa/qc records , such as the single-laboratory-precision data , would not be available . 5 . since it is mandatory that the identity of test-organisms is known to the species-level , it would be necessary to examine each organism caught in the wild to confirm its identity , which would usually be impractical or , at the least , very stressful to the organisms . 6 . test-organisms obtained from the wild must be observed in the laboratory for a minimum of one week prior to use , to ensure that they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial-infections and other adverse-effects . fish captured by electroshocking must not be used in toxicity-testing . 6.2.5.2 guidelines for collection of natural occurring-organisms are provided in usepa ( 1973 ) ; usepa ( 1990a ) ; and usepa ( 1993b ) . 6.2.6 regardless of their source , test-organisms should be carefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stress and disease , and in good physical-condition . some species of test-organisms , such as trout , can be obtained from stocks certified as '' disease-free . '' 6.3 life-stage 6.3.1 young-organisms are often more sensitive to toxicants than are adults . for this reason , the use of early-life-stages , such as juvenile-mysids and larval-fish , is required for all tests . in a given test , all organisms should be approximately the same age and should be taken from the same source . since age may affect the results of the tests , it would enhance the value and comparability of the data if the same species in the same life-stages were used throughout a monitoring-program at a given facility . 6.4 laboratory culturing 6.4.1 instructions for culturing and/or holding the recommended-test-organisms are included in specified-test-methods ( also , see usepa , 2002a ) . 6.5 holding and handling test-organisms 6.5.1 test-organisms should not be subjected to changes of more than 3°c in water-temperature or 3‰ in salinity in any 12 h period . 6.5.2 organisms should be handled as little as possible . when handling is necessary , it should be done as gently , carefully , and quickly as possible to minimize stress . organisms that are dropped or touch dry-surfaces or are injured during handling must be discarded . dipnets are best for handling larger organisms . these nets are commercially-available or can be made from small-mesh nylon-netting , silk bolting-cloth , plankton-netting , or similar material . wide-bore , smooth-glass-tubes ( 4 to 8 mm id ) with rubber-bulbs or pipettors ( such as a propipette® or other pipettor ) should be used for transferring smaller organisms such as mysids , and larval-fish . 6.5.3 holding-tanks for fish are supplied with a good-quality water ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies ) with a flow-through-rate of at least two tank-volumes per day . otherwise , use a recirculation-system where the water flows through an activated carbon or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolites . culture-water can also be piped through high intensity-ultraviolet light-sources for disinfection , and to photo-degrade dissolved organics . 6.5.4 crowding should be avoided because it will stress the organisms and lower the do concentrations to unacceptable-levels . the do must be maintained at a minimum of 4.0 mg/l . the solubility of oxygen depends on temperature , salinity , and altitude . aerate gently if necessary . 6.5.5 the organisms should be observed carefully each day for signs of disease , stress , physical-damage , or mortality . dead and abnormal-organisms should be removed as soon as observed . it is not uncommon for some fish-mortality ( 510 % ) to occur during the first 48 h in a holding-tank because of individuals that refuse to feed on artificial-food and die of starvation . organisms in the holding-tanks should generally be fed as in the cultures ( see culturing methods in the respective-methods ) . 6.5.6 fish should be fed as much as they will eat at least once a day with live brine-shrimp-nauplii , artemia , or frozen-adult brine-shrimp or dry-food ( frozen-food should be completely thawed before use ) . adult-brine-shrimp can be supplemented with commercially prepared-food such as tetramin® or bioril® flake-food , or equivalent . excess food and fecal-material should be removed from the bottom of the tanks at least twice a week by siphoning . 6.5.7 a daily-record of feeding , behavioral-observations , and mortality should be maintained . 6.6 transportation to the test-site 6.6.1 organisms are transported from the base or supply laboratory to a remote-test-site in culture-water or standard-dilution-water in plastic-bags or large-mouth-screw-cap ( 500 ml ) plastic-bottles in styrofoam-coolers . adequate do is maintained by replacing the air above the water in the bags with oxygen from a compressed gas-cylinder , and sealing the bags . another method commonly used to maintain sufficient do during shipment is to aerate with an airstone which is supplied from a portable-pump . the do concentration must not fall below 4.0 mg/l . 6.6.2 upon arrival at the test-site , organisms are transferred to receiving-water if receiving-water is to be used as the test-dilution-water . all but a small-volume of the holding-water ( approximately 5 % ) is removed by siphoning , and replaced slowly over a 10 to 15-minute-period with dilution-water . if receiving-water is used as dilution-water , caution must be exercised in exposing the test-organisms to it , because of the possibility that it might be toxic . for this reason , it is recommended that only approximately 10 % of the test-organisms be exposed initially to the dilution-water . if this group does not show excessive-mortality or obvious-signs of stress in a few hours , the remainder of the test-organisms are transferred to the dilution-water . 6.6.3 a group of organisms must not be used for a test if they appear to be unhealthy , discolored , or otherwise stressed , or if mortality appears to exceed 10 % preceding the test . if the organisms fail to meet these criteria , the entire-group must be discarded and a new group obtained . the mortality may be due to the presence of toxicity , if receiving-water is used as dilution-water , rather than a diseased-condition of the test-organisms . if the acclimation-process is repeated with a new group of test-organisms and excessive-mortality occurs , it is recommended that an alternative-source of dilution-water be used . 6.6.4 the marine-organisms can be used at all concentrations of effluent by adjusting the salinity of the effluent to salinities specified for the appropriate species test-condition or to the salinity approximating that of the receiving-water , by adding sufficient dry-ocean-salts , such as forty fathoms® , or equivalent , gp2 , or hypersaline-brine . 6.6.5 saline-dilution-water can be prepared with deionized-water or a freshwater such as well water or a suitable-surface water . if dry-ocean-salts are used , care must be taken to ensure that the added salts are completely dissolved and the solution is aerated 24 h before the test-organisms are placed in the solutions . the test-organisms should be acclimated in synthetic-saline-water prepared with the dry-salts . caution : addition of dry-ocean-salts to dilution-water may result in an increase in ph . ( the ph of estuarine and coastal-saline-waters is normally 7.5-8.3 ) . 6.6.6 all effluent-concentrations and the control ( s ) used in a test should have the same salinity . the change in salinity upon acclimation at the desired test-dilution should not exceed 6‰ . the required salinities for culturing and toxicity-tests with estuarine and marine-species are listed in the test-method sections . 6.7 test-organism disposal 6.7.1 when the toxicity-test ( s ) is concluded , all test-organisms ( including-controls ) should be humanely destroyed and disposed of in an appropriate-manner . section 7 dilution-water 7.1 types of dilution-water 7.1.1 the type of dilution-water used in effluent-toxicity-tests will depend largely on the objectives of the study . 7.1.1.1 if the objective of the test is to estimate the absolute chronic-toxicity of the effluent , a synthetic ( standard ) dilution-water is used . if the test-organisms have been cultured in water which is different from the test-dilution-water , a second set of controls , using-culture-water , should be included in the test . 7.1.1.2 if the objective of the test is to estimate the chronic-toxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving-water , the test may be conducted using-dilution-water consisting of a single-grab-sample of receiving-water ( if non-toxic ) , collected outside the influence of the outfall , or with other uncontaminated natural-water ( surface-water ) or standard-dilution-water having approximately the same salinity as the receiving-water . seasonal-variations in the quality of receiving-waters may affect effluent-toxicity . therefore , the salinity of saline receiving-water-samples should be determined before each use . if the test-organisms have been cultured in water which is different from the test-dilution-water , a second set of controls , using-culture-water , should be included in the test . 7.1.1.3 if the objective of the test is to determine the additive or mitigating-effects of the discharge on already contaminated receiving-water , the test is performed using-dilution-water consisting of receiving-water collected outside the influence of the outfall . a second set of controls , using-culture-water , should be included in the test . 7.1.2 an acceptable-dilution-water is one which is appropriate for the objectives of the test ; supports adequate-performance of the test-organisms with respect to survival , growth , reproduction , or other responses that may be measured in the test ( i.e. , consistently meets test-acceptability-criteria for control-responses ) ; is consistent in quality ; and does not contain contaminants that could produce toxicity . receiving-waters , synthetic-waters , or synthetic-waters adjusted to approximate receiving-water-characteristics may be used for dilution provided that the water meets the above listed-qualifications for an acceptable-dilution-water . usepa ( 2000a ) provides additional-guidance on selecting appropriate-dilution-waters . 7.1.3 when dual-controls ( one control using-culture-water and one control using-dilution-water ) are used ( see subsections 7.1.1.1 - 7.1.1.3 above ) , the dilution-water-control should be used to determine test-acceptability . it is also the dilution-water-control that should be compared to effluent-treatments in the calculation and reporting of test results . the culture-water-control should be used to evaluate the appropriateness of the dilution-water-source . significant-differences between organism-responses in culture-water and dilution-water-controls could indicate toxicity in the dilution-water and may suggest an alternative dilution-water-source . usepa ( 2000a ) provides additional-guidance on dual-controls . 7.2 standard , synthetic-dilution-water 7.2.1 standard , synthetic , dilution-water is prepared with deionized-water and reagent-grade-chemicals ( gp2 ) or commercial-sea-salts ( forty fathoms® , hw marinemix® ) ( table 3 ) . the source-water for the deionizer can be ground-water or tap-water . 7.2.2 deionized-water used to prepare standard , synthetic , dilution-water 7.2.2.1 deionized-water is obtained from a millipore milli-q® , millipore® qpak™2 or equivalent-system . it is advisable to provide a preconditioned ( deionized ) feed-water by using a culligan® , continental® , or equivalent-system in front of the milli-q® system to extend the life of the milli-q® cartridges ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies ) . 7.2.2.2 the recommended-order of the cartridges in a four-cartridge deionizer ( i.e. , milli-q® system or equivalent ) is : ( 1 ) ion exchange , ( 2 ) ion exchange , ( 3 ) carbon , and ( 4 ) organic cleanup ( such as organex-q® , or equivalent ) , followed by a final bacteria filter . the qpak™2 water system is a sealed-system which does not allow for the rearranging of the cartridges . however , the final-cartridge is an organex-q® filter , followed by a final bacteria filter . commercial-laboratories using this system have not experienced any difficulty in using the water for culturing or testing . reference to the milli-q® systems throughout the remainder of the manual includes all millipore® or equivalent systems . 7.2.3 standard , synthetic-seawater 7.2.3.1 to prepare 20 l of a standard , synthetic , reconstituted seawater ( modified gp2 ) , using-reagent grade-chemicals ( table 3 ) , with a salinity of 31‰ , follow the instructions below . other salinities can be prepared by making the appropriate-dilutions . larger or smaller volumes of modified gp2 can be prepared by using proportionately larger or smaller amounts of salts and dilution-water . 1 . place 20 l of milli-q® or equivalent deionized-water in a properly cleaned-plastic-carboy . 2 . weigh reagent-grade-salts listed in table 3 and add , one at a time , to the deionized-water . stir well after adding each salt . 3 . aerate the final-solution at a rate of 1 l/h for 24 h. 4 . check the ph and salinity . 7.2.3.2 synthetic-seawater can also be prepared by adding commercial-sea-salts , such as forty fathoms® , hw marinemix® , or equivalent , to deionized-water . for example , thirty-one-parts per thousand ( 31‰ ) forty fathoms® can be prepared by dissolving 31 g of sea-salts per liter of deionized-water . the salinity of the resulting-solutions should be checked with a refractometer . 7.2.4 artificial-seawater is to be used only if specified in the method . emsl-cincinnati has found forty fathoms® artificial-sea-salts suitable for maintaining and spawning the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus , and for its use in the sheepshead-minnow larval-survival and growth-test , suitable for maintaining and spawning the inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina , and for its use in the inland-silverside larval-survival and growth-test , suitable for culturing and maintaining mysid-shrimp , mysidopsis-bahia , and its use in the mysid-shrimp-survival , growth , and fecundity-test , and suitable for maintaining-sea-urchins , arbacia-punctulata , and for its use in the sea-urchin fertilization-test . the usepa region 6 houston laboratory has successfully used hw marinemix® sea-salts to maintain and spawn sheepshead-minnows , and perform the larval-survival and growth-test and the embryo-larval-survival and teratogenicity-test . also , hw marinemix® sea-salts has been used successfully to culture and maintain the mysid brood-stock and perform the mysid-survival , growth , fecundity-test . an artificial-seawater formulation , gp2 ( spotte et al. , 1984 ) , table 3 , has been used by the environmental-research laboratory-narragansett , ri for all but the embryolarval-survival and teratogenicity-test . the suitability of gp2 as a medium for culturing-organisms has not been determined . table 3 . preparation of gp2 artificial-seawater using-reagent grade chemicals1,2,3 1 modified gp2 from spotte et al . ( 1984 ) . 2 the constituent-salts and concentrations were taken from usepa ( 2002a ) . the salinity is 30.89 g/l . 3 gp2 can be diluted with deionized ( di ) water to the desired test-salinity . 7.3 use of receiving-water as dilution-water 7.3.1 if the objectives of the test require the use of uncontaminated receiving-water as dilution-water , and the receiving-water is uncontaminated , it may be possible to collect a sample of the receiving-water close to the outfall , but should be away from or beyond the influence of the effluent . however , if the receiving-water is contaminated , it may be necessary to collect the sample in an area `` remote '' from the discharge-site , matching as closely as possible the physical and chemical-characteristics of the receiving-water near the outfall . 7.3.2 the sample should be collected immediately prior to the test , but never more than 96 h before the test begins . except where it is used within 24 h , or in the case where large-volumes are required for flow-through-tests , the sample should be chilled to 0-6°c during or immediately following-collection , and maintained at that temperature prior to use in the test . 7.3.3 the investigator should collect uncontaminated-water having a salinity as near as possible to the salinity of the receiving-water at the discharge-site . water should be collected at slack high tide , or within one hour after high tide . if there is reason to suspect contamination of the water in the estuary , it is advisable to collect uncontaminated-water from an adjacent-estuary . at times it may be necessary to collect water at a location closer to the open-sea , where the salinity is relatively high . in such cases , deionized-water or uncontaminated-freshwater is added to the saline-water to dilute it to the required-test-salinity . where necessary , the salinity of a surface-water can be increased by the addition of artificial-sea-salts , such as forty fathoms® , hw marinemix® , or equivalent , gp2 , a natural-seawater of higher salinity , or hypersaline-brine . instructions for the preparation of hypersaline-brine by concentrating natural-seawater are provided below . 7.3.4 receiving-water containing-debris or indigenous-organisms , that may be confused with or attack the test-organisms , should be filtered through a sieve having 60 µm mesh-openings prior to use . 7.3.5 hypersaline-brine 7.3.5.1 hypersaline-brine ( hsb ) has several-advantages that make it desirable for use in toxicity-testing . it can be made from any high quality , filtered seawater by evaporation , and can be added to deionized-water to prepare dilution-water , or to effluents or surface-waters to increase their salinity . 7.3.5.2 the ideal-container for making hsb from natural-seawater is one that ( l ) has a high surface to volume-ratio , ( 2 ) is made of a noncorrosive-material , and ( 3 ) is easily cleaned ( fiberglass-containers are ideal ) . special-care should be used to prevent any toxic-materials from coming in contact with the seawater being used to generate the brine . if a heater is immersed directly into the seawater , ensure that the heater-materials do not corrode or leach any substances that would contaminate the brine . one successful-method used is a thermostatically controlled heat exchanger made from fiberglass . if aeration is used , use only oil-free air-compressors to prevent contamination . 7.3.5.3 before adding-seawater to the brine-generator , thoroughly clean the generator , aeration-supply-tube , heater , and any other materials that will be in direct-contact with the brine . a good-quality biodegradable-detergent should be used , followed by several thorough deionized-water-rinses . high quality ( and preferably high salinity ) seawater should be filtered to at least 10 mm before placing into the brine-generator . water should be collected on an incoming-tide to minimize the possibility of contamination . 7.3.5.4 the temperature of the seawater is increased slowly to 40°c . the water should be aerated to prevent temperature stratification and to increase water-evaporation . the brine should be checked daily ( depending on the volume being generated ) to ensure that the salinity does not exceed 100‰ and that the temperature does not exceed 40°c . additional-seawater may be added to the brine to obtain the volume of brine required . 7.3.5.5 after the required-salinity is attained , the hsb should be filtered a second time through a l-µm filter and poured directly into portable-containers ( 20-l cubitainers® or polycarbonate-water cooler jugs are suitable ) . the containers should be capped and labelled with the date the brine was generated and its salinity . containers of hsb should be stored in the dark and maintained under room-temperature until used . 7.3.5.6 if a source of hsb is available , test-solutions can be made by following the directions below . thoroughly mix together the deionized-water and brine before mixing in the effluent . 7.3.5.7 divide the salinity of the hsb by the expected test-salinity to determine the proportion of deionized-water to brine . for example , if the salinity of the brine is 100‰ and the test is to be conducted at 25‰ , 100‰ divided by 25‰ = 4.0 . the proportion of brine is 1 part in 4 ( one part-brine to three parts deionized-water ) . 7.3.5.8 to make 1 l of seawater at 25‰ salinity from a hypersaline-brine of 100‰ , 250 ml of brine and 750 ml of deionized-water are required . 7.4 use of tap-water as dilution-water 7.4.1 the use of tap-water in the reconstituting of synthetic ( artificial ) seawater as dilution-water is discouraged unless it is dechlorinated and fully treated . tap-water can be dechlorinated by deionization , carbon-filtration , or the use of sodium-thiosulfate . use of 3.6 mg/l ( anhydrous ) sodium-thiosulfate will reduce 1.0 mg chlorine/l ( apha , 1992 ) . following-dechlorination , total residual-chlorine should not exceed 0.01 mg/l . because of the possible-toxicity of thiosulfate to test-organisms , a control lacking-thiosulfate should be included in toxicity-tests utilizing thiosulfate-dechlorinated-water . 7.4.2 to be adequate for general-laboratory-use following-dechlorination , the tap-water is passed through a deionizer and carbon-filter to remove toxic-metals and organics , and to control hardness and alkalinity . 7.5 dilution-water holding 7.5.1 a given batch of dilution-water should not be used for more than 14 days following-preparation because of the possible build up of bacterial , fungal , or algal-slime-growth and the problems associated with it . the container should be kept covered and the contents should be protected from light . section 8 effluent and receiving-water sampling , sample handling , and sample preparation for toxicity-tests 8.1 effluent-sampling 8.1.1 the effluent-sampling-point should be the same as that specified in the npdes discharge-permit ( usepa , l988b ) . conditions for exception would be : ( l ) better access to a sampling-point between the final-treatment and the discharge-outfall ; ( 2 ) if the processed waste is chlorinated prior to discharge , it may also be desirable to take samples prior to contact with the chlorine to determine toxicity of the unchlorinated-effluent ; or ( 3 ) in the event there is a desire to evaluate the toxicity of the influent to municipal-waste treatment plants or separate-wastewater-streams in industrial-facilities prior to their being combined with other wastewater-streams or non-contact cooling-water , additional sampling-points may be chosen . 8.1.2 the decision on whether to collect grab or composite-samples is based on the objectives of the test and an understanding of the short and long-term-operations and schedules of the discharger . if the effluent-quality varies considerably with time , which can occur where holding-times are short , grab-samples may seem preferable because of the ease of collection and the potential of observing-peaks ( spikes ) in toxicity . however , the sampling duration of a grab-sample is so short that full-characterization of an effluent over a 24-h period would require a prohibitively-large number of separate-samples and tests . collection of a 24-h composite-sample , however , may dilute toxicity-spikes , and average the quality of the effluent over the sampling-period . sampling recommendations are provided below ( also see usepa , 2002a ) . 8.1.3 aeration during collection and transfer of effluents should be minimized to reduce the loss of volatile-chemicals . 8.1.4 details of date , time , location , duration , and procedures used for effluent-sample and dilution-water-collection should be recorded . 8.2 effluent-sample types 8.2.1 the advantages and disadvantages of effluent-grab and composite-samples are listed below : 8.2.1.1 grab-samples advantages : 1 . easy to collect ; require a minimum of equipment and on-site-time . 2 . provide a measure of instantaneous-toxicity . toxicity-spikes are not masked by dilution . disadvantages : 1 . samples are collected over a very short period of time and on a relatively infrequent-basis . the chances of detecting a spike in toxicity would depend on the frequency of sampling , and the probability of missing-spikes is high . 8.2.1.2 composite-samples : advantages : 1 . a single-effluent sample is collected over a 24-h period . 2 . the sample is collected over a much longer period of time than grab-samples and contains all toxicity-spikes . disadvantages : 1 . sampling-equipment is more sophisticated and expensive , and must be placed on-site for at least 24 h. 2 . toxicity-spikes may not be detected because they are masked by dilution with less toxic-wastes . 8.3 effluent-sampling recommendations 8.3.1 when tests are conducted on-site , test-solutions can be renewed daily with freshly collected samples . 8.3.2 when tests are conducted off-site , a minimum of three samples are collected . if these samples are collected on test days 1 , 3 , and 5 , the first sample would be used for test-initiation , and for test-solution-renewal on day 2 . the second sample would be used for test-solution-renewal on days 3 and 4 . the third-sample would be used for test-solution-renewal on days 5 , 6 , and 7 . 8.3.3 sufficient-sample must be collected to perform the required toxicity and chemical-tests . a 4-l ( 1-gal ) cubitainer® will provide sufficient-sample-volume for most tests . 8.3.4 the following effluent-sampling methods are recommended : 8.3.4.1 continuous-discharges 8.3.4.1.1 if the facility-discharge is continuous , a single 24-h composite-sample is to be taken . 8.3.4.2 intermittent-discharges 8.3.4.2.1 if the facility-discharge is intermittent , a composite-sample is to be collected for the duration of the discharge but not more than 24 hours . 8.4 receiving-water sampling 8.4.1 logistical-problems and difficulty in securing-sampling equipment generally preclude the collection of composite-receiving water-samples for toxicity-tests . therefore , based on the requirements of the test , a single-grab-sample or daily grab-samples of receiving-water is collected for use in the test . 8.4.2 the sampling-point is determined by the objectives of the test . at estuarine and marine-sites , samples should be collected at mid-depth . 8.4.3 to determine the extent of the zone of toxicity in the receiving-water at estuarine and marine effluent-sites , receiving-water-samples are collected at several-distances away from the discharge . the time required for the effluent-receiving-water mixture to travel to sampling-points away from the effluent , and the rate and degree of mixing , may be difficult to ascertain . therefore , it may not be possible to correlate receiving-water toxicity with effluent-toxicity at the discharge-point unless a dye-study is performed . the toxicity of receiving-water-samples from five stations in the discharge-plume can be evaluated using the same number of test-vessels and test-organisms as used in one effluent-toxicity-test with five effluent-dilutions . 8.5 effluent and receiving-water-sample handling , preservation , and shipping 8.5.1 unless the samples are used in an on-site-toxicity-test the day of collection ( or hand delivered to the testing-laboratory for use on the day of collection ) , it is recommended that they be held at 0-6°c until used to inhibit microbial-degradation , chemical-transformations , and loss of highly-volatile toxic-substances . 8.5.2 composite-samples should be chilled as they are collected . grab-samples should be chilled immediately following-collection . 8.5.3 if the effluent has been chlorinated , total residual-chlorine must be measured immediately following-sample collection . 8.5.4 sample-holding-time begins when the last-grab-sample in a series is taken ( i.e. , when a series of four grab-samples are taken over a 24-h period ) , or when a 24-h composite sampling-period is completed . if the data from the samples are to be acceptable for use in the npdes program , the lapsed-time ( holding-time ) from sample-collection to first use of each grab or composite-sample must not exceed 36 h. epa believes that 36 h is adequate-time to deliver the sample to the laboratories performing the test in most cases . in the isolated-cases , where the permittee can document that this delivery-time can not be met , the permitting-authority can allow an option for on-site-testing or a variance for an extension of shipped sample-holding-time . the request for a variance in sample-holding-time , directed to the usepa regional administrator under 40 cfr 136.3 ( e ) , should include supportive-data which show that the toxicity of the effluent-sample is not reduced ( e.g. , because of volatilization and/or sorption of toxics on the sample-container surfaces ) by extending the holding-time beyond more than 36 h. however , in no case should more than 72 h elapse between collection and first use of the sample . in static-renewal-tests , each grab or composite-sample may also be used to prepare test-solutions for renewal at 24 h and/or 48 h after first use , if stored at 0-6°c , with minimum-head-space , as described in subsection 8.5 . if shipping-problems ( e.g. , unsuccessful saturday delivery ) are encountered with renewal-samples after a test has been initiated , the permitting-authority may allow the continued use of the most recently used sample for test-renewal . guidance for determining the persistence of the sample is provided in subsection 8.7 . 8.5.5 to minimize the loss of toxicity due to volatilization of toxic-constituents , all sample-containers should be `` completely '' filled , leaving no air-space between the contents and the lid . 8.5.6 samples used in on-site-tests 8.5.6.1 samples collected for on-site-tests should be used within 24 h. 8.5.7 samples shipped to off site facilities 8.5.7.1 samples collected for off site-toxicity-testing are to be chilled to 0-6°c during or immediately after collection , and shipped iced to the performing-laboratory . sufficient-ice should be placed with the sample in the shipping-container to ensure that ice will still be present when the sample arrives at the laboratory and is unpacked . insulating-material should not be placed between the ice and the sample in the shipping-container unless required to prevent breakage of glass-sample-containers . 8.5.7.2 samples may be shipped in one or more 4-l ( l-gal ) cubitainers® or new plastic `` milk '' jugs . all sample-containers should be rinsed with source-water before being filled with sample . after use with receiving-water or effluents , cubitainers® and plastic-jugs are punctured to prevent reuse . 8.5.7.3 several sample shipping options are available , including express mail , air express , bus , and courier-service . express mail is delivered seven days a week . saturday and sunday shipping and receiving-schedules of private-carriers vary with the carrier . 8.6 sample receiving 8.6.1 upon arrival at the laboratory , samples are logged in and the temperature is measured and recorded . if the samples are not immediately prepared for testing , they are stored at 0-6°c until used . 8.6.2 every effort must be made to initiate the test with an effluent-sample on the day of arrival in the laboratory , and the sample-holding-time should not exceed 36 h unless a variance has been granted by the npdes permitting-authority . 8.7 persistence of effluent-toxicity during sample-shipment and holding 8.7.1 the persistence of the toxicity of an effluent prior to its use in a toxicity-test is of interest in assessing the validity of toxicity-test-data , and in determining the possible-effects of allowing an extension of the holding-time . where a variance in holding-time ( > 36 h , but # 72 h ) is requested by a permittee ( see subsection 8.5.4 ) , information on the effects of the extension in holding-time on the toxicity of the samples must be obtained by comparing the results of multi-concentration chronic-toxicity-tests performed on effluent-samples held 36 h with toxicity-test-results using the same samples after they were held for the requested , longer period . the portion of the sample set aside for the second test must be held under the same conditions as during shipment and holding . 8.8 preparation of effluent and receiving-water-samples for toxicity-tests 8.8.1 adjust the sample-salinity to the level appropriate for objectives of the study using hypersaline-brine or artificial-sea-salts . 8.8.2 when aliquots are removed from the sample-container , the head-space above the remaining-sample should be held to a minimum . air which enters a container upon removal of sample should be expelled by compressing the container before reclosing , if possible ( i.e. , where a cubitainer® used ) , or by using an appropriate discharge-valve ( spigot ) . 8.8.3 it may be necessary to first coarse-filter-samples through a nylon® sieve having 2 to 4 mm-mesh-openings to remove debris and/or break up large floating or suspended solids . if samples contain indigenous-organisms that may attack or be confused with the test-organisms , the samples should be filtered through a sieve with 60-µm mesh-openings . since filtering may increase the dissolved oxygen ( do ) in an effluent , the do should be checked both before and after filtering . low dissolved oxygen-concentrations will indicate a potential-problem in performing the test . caution : filtration may remove some toxicity . 8.8.4 if the samples must be warmed to bring them to the prescribed-test-temperature , supersaturation of the dissolved oxygen and nitrogen may become a problem . to avoid this problem , samples may be warmed slowly in open-test-containers . if do is still above 100 % saturation , based on temperature and salinity ( table 4 ) , after warming to test temperature , samples should be aerated moderately ( approximately 500 ml/min ) for a few minutes using an airstone . if do is below 4.0 mg/l , the solutions must be aerated moderately ( approximately 500 ml/min ) for a few minutes , using an airstone , until the do is within the prescribed-range ( $ 4.0 mg/l ) . caution : avoid excessive-aeration . 8.8.4.1 aeration during the test may alter the results and should be used only as a last resort to maintain the required do . aeration can reduce the apparent-toxicity of the test-solutions by stripping them of highly-volatile toxic-substances , or increase their toxicity by altering the ph . however , the do in the test-solution should not be permitted to fall below 4.0 mg/l . 8.8.4.2 in static-tests ( non-renewal or renewal ) low dos may commonly occur in the higher concentrations of wastewater . aeration is accomplished by bubbling-air through a pipet at the rate of 100 bubbles/min . if aeration is necessary , all test-solutions must be aerated . it is advisable to monitor the do closely during the first few hours of the test . samples with a potential do problem generally show a downward-trend in do within 4 to 8 h after the test is started . unless aeration is initiated during the first 8 h of the test , the do may be exhausted during an unattended-period , thereby invalidating the test . 8.8.5 at a minimum , ph , conductivity or salinity , and total residual-chlorine are measured in the undiluted-effluent or receiving-water , and ph and conductivity are measured in the dilution-water . 8.8.5.1 it is recommended that total-alkalinity and total-hardness also be measured in the undiluted-effluent test water and the dilution-water . 8.8.6 total-ammonia is measured in effluent and receiving-water-samples where toxicity may be contributed by unionized-ammonia ( i.e. , where total-ammonia $ 5 mg/l ) . the concentration ( mg/l ) of unionized ( free ) ammonia in a sample is a function of temperature and ph , and is calculated using the percentage-value obtained from table 5 , under the appropriate ph and temperature , and multiplying it by the concentration ( mg/l ) of total-ammonia in the sample . 8.8.7 effluents and receiving-waters can be dechlorinated using 6.7 mg/l anhydrous-sodium thiosulfate to reduce 1 mg/l chlorine ( apha , 1992 ) . note that the amount of thiosulfate required to dechlorinate-effluents is greater than the amount needed to dechlorinate-tap-water , ( see section 7 , dilution-water ) . since thiosulfate may contribute to sample toxicity , a thiosulfate-control should be used in the test in addition to the normal dilution-water-control . 8.8.8 the do concentration in the samples should be near saturation prior to use . aeration will bring the do and other gases into equilibrium with air , minimize oxygen-demand , and stabilize the ph . however , aeration during collection , transfer , and preparation of samples should be minimized to reduce the loss of volatile-chemicals . 8.8.9 mortality or impairment of growth or reproduction due to ph alone may occur if the ph of the sample falls outside the range of 6.0 - 9.0 . thus , the presence of other forms of toxicity ( metals and organics ) in the sample may be masked by the toxic-effects of low or high ph . the question about the presence of other toxicants can be answered only by performing two parallel-tests , one with an adjusted ph , and one without an adjusted ph . freshwater-samples are adjusted to ph 7.0 , and marine-samples are adjusted to ph 8.0 , by adding 1n naoh or 1n hcl dropwise , as required , being careful to avoid overadjustment . table provided by teresa norberg-king , duluth , minnesota . also see emerson et al . ( 1975 ) , thurston et al . ( 1974 ) , and usepa ( 1985a ) . 8.9 preliminary-toxicity range-finding tests 8.9.1 usepa regional and state personnel generally have observed that it is not necessary to conduct a toxicity range-finding-test prior to initiating a static , chronic , definitive-toxicity-test . however , when preparing to perform a static-test with a sample of completely unknown-quality , or before initiating a flow-through-test , it is advisable to conduct a preliminary-toxicity range-finding-test . 8.9.2 a toxicity range-finding-test ordinarily consists of a down-scaled , abbreviated static acute-test in which groups of five organisms are exposed to several widely-spaced-sample-dilutions in a logarithmic-series , such as 100 % , 10.0 % , 1.00 % , and 0.100 % , and a control , for 8-24 h. caution : if the sample must also be used for the fullscale definitive-test , the 36-h limit on holding-time ( see subsection 8.5.4 ) must not be exceeded before the definitive-test is initiated . 8.9.3 it should be noted that the toxicity ( lc50 ) of a sample observed in a range-finding-test may be significantly-different from the toxicity observed in the follow-up , chronic , definitive-test because : ( 1 ) the definitive-test is longer ; and ( 2 ) the test may be performed with a sample collected at a different-time , and possibly differing significantly in the level of toxicity . 8.10 multiconcentration ( definitive ) effluent-toxicity-tests 8.10.1 the tests recommended for use in determining-discharge permit compliance in the npdes program are multiconcentration , or definitive , tests which provide ( 1 ) a point-estimate of effluent-toxicity in terms of an ic25 , ic50 , or lc50 , or ( 2 ) a no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) defined in terms of mortality , growth , reproduction , and/or teratogenicity and obtained by hypothesis-testing . the tests may be static-renewal or static-non-renewal . 8.10.2 the tests consist of a control and a minimum of five effluent-concentrations . usepa recommends the use of a $ 0.5 dilution-factor for selecting effluent-test-concentrations . effluent-test-concentrations of 6.25 % , 12.5 % , 25 % , 50 % , and 100 % are commonly used , however , test-concentrations should be selected independently for each test based on the objective of the study , the expected-range of toxicity , the receiving-water-concentration , and any available historical-testing-information on the effluent . usepa ( 2000a ) provides additional-guidance on choosing appropriate test-concentrations . 8.10.3 when these tests are used in determining-compliance with permit-limits , effluent-test-concentrations should be selected to bracket the receiving-water-concentration . this may be achieved by selecting effluent-test-concentrations in the following-manner : ( 1 ) 100 % effluent , ( 2 ) [ rwc + 100 ] /2 , ( 3 ) rwc , ( 4 ) rwc/2 , and ( 5 ) rwc/4 . for example , where the rwc = 50 % , appropriate-effluent concentrations may be 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % , and 12.5 % . 8.10.4 if acute/chronic ratios are to be determined by simultaneous acute and short-term chronic-tests with a single-species , using the same sample , both types of tests must use the same test-conditions , i.e. , ph , temperature , water-hardness , salinity , etc . 8.11 receiving-water-tests 8.11.1 receiving-water toxicity-tests generally consist of 100 % receiving-water and a control . the total-salinity of the control should be comparable to the receiving-water . 8.11.2 the data from the two treatments are analyzed by hypothesis-testing to determine if test-organism-survival in the receiving-water differs significantly from the control . four replicates and 10 organisms per replicate are required for each treatment ( see summary of test-conditions and test-acceptability-criteria in the specific-test-method ) . 8.11.3 in cases where the objective of the test is to estimate the degree of toxicity of the receiving-water , a definitive , multiconcentration-test is performed by preparing-dilutions of the receiving-water , using a $ 0.5 dilution-series , with a suitable-control water . section 9 chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis 9.1 endpoints 9.1.1 the objective of chronic aquatic-toxicity-tests with effluents and pure-compounds is to estimate the highest `` safe '' or '' no-effect-concentration '' of these substances . for practical reasons , the responses observed in these tests are usually-limited to hatchability , gross morphological-abnormalities , survival , growth , and reproduction , and the results of the tests are usually expressed in terms of the highest toxicant-concentration that has no statistically-significant observed-effect on these responses , when compared to the controls . the terms currently used to define the endpoints employed in the rapid , chronic and sub-chronic toxicity-tests have been derived from the terms previously used for full-life-cycle-tests . as shorter chronic-tests were developed , it became common-practice to apply the same terminology to the endpoints . the terms used in this manual are as follows : 9.1.1.1 safe-concentration - the highest concentration of toxicant that will permit normal-propagation of fish and other aquatic-life in receiving-waters . the concept of a `` safe-concentration '' is a biological-concept , whereas the '' no-observed-effect-concentration '' ( below ) is a statistically defined concentration . 9.1.1.2 no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) - the highest concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a full-life-cycle or partial-life-cycle ( short-term ) test , that causes no observable adverse-effects on the test-organisms ( i.e. , the highest concentration of toxicant in which the values for the observed-responses are not statistically significantly-different from the controls ) . this value is used , along with other factors , to determine toxicity-limits in permits . 9.1.1.3 lowest-observed-effect-concentration ( loec ) - the lowest concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a life-cycle or partial-life-cycle ( short-term ) test , which causes adverse-effects on the test-organisms ( i.e. , where the values for the observed-responses are statistically significantly-different from the controls ) . 9.1.1.4 effective-concentration ( ec ) - a point-estimate of the toxicant-concentration that would cause an observable adverse-affect on a quantal , `` all or nothing , '' response ( such as death , immobilization , or serious-incapacitation ) in a given percent of the test-organisms , calculated by point-estimation-techniques . if the observable-effect is death or immobility , the term , lethal-concentration ( lc ) , should be used ( see subsection 9.1.1.5 ) . a certain ec or lc value might be judged from a biological-standpoint to represent a threshold-concentration , or lowest concentration that would cause an adverse-effect on the observed response . 9.1.1.5 lethal-concentration ( lc ) - the toxicant-concentration that would cause-death in a given percent of the test-population . identical to ec when the observable adverse-effect is death . for example , the lc50 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause-death in 50 % of the test-population . 9.1.1.6 inhibition-concentration ( ic ) - the toxicant-concentration that would cause a given percent-reduction in a nonquantal biological-measurement for the test-population . for example , the ic25 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause a 25 % reduction in mean young per female or in growth for the test-population , and the ic50 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause a 50 % reduction in the mean-population responses . 9.2 relationship between endpoints determined by hypothesis-testing and point-estimation-techniques 9.2.1 if the objective of chronic aquatic-toxicity-tests with effluents and pure-compounds is to estimate the highest `` safe or no-effect-concentration '' of these substances , it is imperative to understand how the statistical-endpoints of these tests are related to the `` safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration . noecs and loecs are determined by hypothesis-testing ( dunnett 's test , a t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment , steel 's many-one rank test , or the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni-adjustment ) , whereas lcs , ics , and ecs are determined by point-estimation-techniques ( probit analysis , the spearman-karber-method , the trimmed spearman-karber-method , the graphical-method or linear-interpolation-method ) . there are inherent-differences between the use of a noec or loec derived from hypothesis-testing to estimate a `` safe '' concentration , and the use of a lc , ic , ec , or other point-estimates derived from curve fitting , interpolation , etc . 9.2.2 most point-estimates , such as the lc , ic , or ec are derived from a mathematical-model that assumes a continuous-dose-response-relationship . by definition , any lc , ic , or ec value is an estimate of some amount of adverse-effect . thus the assessment of a `` safe '' concentration must be made from a biological-standpoint rather than with a statistical-test . in this instance , the biologist must determine some amount of adverse-effect that is deemed to be `` safe , '' in the sense that from a practical biological viewpoint it will not affect the normal-propagation of fish and other aquatic-life in receiving-waters . 9.2.3 the use of noecs and loecs , on the other hand , assumes either ( 1 ) a continuous-dose-response-relationship , or ( 2 ) a non-continuous ( threshold ) model of the dose-response-relationship . 9.2.3.1 in the case of a continuous-dose-response-relationship , it is also assumed that adverse-effects that are not `` statistically-observable '' are also not important from a biological-standpoint , since they are not pronounced enough to test as statistically-significant against some measure of the natural-variability of the responses . 9.2.3.2 in the case of non-continuous-dose-response relationships , it is assumed that there exists a true-threshold , or concentration below which there is no adverse-effect on aquatic-life , and above which there is an adverse-effect . the purpose of the statistical-analysis in this case is to estimate as closely as possible where that threshold lies . 9.2.3.3 in either case , it is important to realize that the amount of adverse-effect that is statistically-observable ( loec ) or not observable ( noec ) is highly-dependent on all aspects of the experimental-design , such as the number of concentrations of toxicant , number of replicates per concentration , number of organisms per replicate , and use of randomization . other factors that affect the sensitivity of the test include the choice of statistical-analysis , the choice of an alpha-level , and the amount of variability between responses at a given concentration . 9.2.3.4 where the assumption of a continuous-dose-response-relationship is made , by definition some amount of adverse-effect might be present at the noec , but is not great enough to be detected by hypothesis-testing . 9.2.3.5 where the assumption of a noncontinuous-dose-response relationship is made , the noec would indeed be an estimate of a '' safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration if the amount of adverse-effect that appears at the threshold is great enough to test as statistically significantly-different from the controls in the face of all aspects of the experimental-design mentioned above . if , however , the amount of adverse-effect at the threshold were not great enough to test as statistically-different , some amount of adverse-effect might be present at the noec . in any case , the estimate of the noec with hypothesis-testing is always-dependent on the aspects of the experimental-design mentioned above . for this reason , the reporting and examination of some measure of the sensitivity of the test ( either the minimum significant-difference or the percent-change from the control that this minimum-difference represents ) is extremely-important . 9.2.4 in summary , the assessment of a `` safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration can not be made from the results of statistical-analysis alone , unless ( 1 ) the assumptions of a strict-threshold model are accepted , and ( 2 ) it is assumed that the amount of adverse-effect present at the threshold is statistically-detectable by hypothesis-testing . in this case , estimates obtained from a statistical-analysis are indeed-estimates of a `` no-effect '' concentration . if the assumptions are not deemed tenable , then estimates from a statistical-analysis can only be used in conjunction with an assessment from a biological-standpoint of what magnitude of adverse-effect constitutes a `` safe '' concentration . in this instance , a `` safe '' concentration is not necessarily a truly '' no-effect '' concentration , but rather a concentration at which the effects are judged to be of no biological-significance . 9.2.5 a better understanding of the relationship between endpoints derived by hypothesis-testing ( noecs ) and point-estimation-techniques ( lcs , ics , and ecs ) would be very helpful in choosing-methods of data-analysis . norberg-king ( 1991 ) reported that the ic25s were comparable to the noecs for 23 effluent and reference-toxicant data-sets analyzed . the data-sets included short-term-chronic-toxicity tests for the sea-urchin , arbacia-punctulata , the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus , and the red-macroalga , champia-parvula . birge et al . ( 1985 ) reported that lc1s derived from probit-analyses of data from short-term embryo-larval-tests with reference-toxicants were comparable to noecs for several-organisms . similarly , usepa ( 1988d ) reported that the ic25s were comparable to the noecs for a set of daphnia , ceriodaphnia-dubia chronic-tests with a single-reference-toxicant . however , the scope of these comparisons was very limited , and sufficient-information is not yet-available to establish an overall-relationship between these two types of endpoints , especially when derived from effluent-toxicity-test data . 9.3 precision 9.3.1 hypothesis-tests 9.3.1.1 when hypothesis-tests are used to analyze toxicity-test-data , it is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly used statistic . the results of the test are given in terms of two endpoints , the no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) and the lowest-observed-effect-concentration ( loec ) . the noec and loec are limited to the concentrations selected for the test . the width of the noec-loec interval is a function of the dilution-series , and differs greatly depending on whether a dilution-factor of 0.3 or 0.5 is used in the test-design . therefore , usepa recommends the use of the $ 0.5 dilution-factor ( see section 4 , quality-assurance ) . it is not possible to place confidence-limits on the noec and loec derived from a given test , and it is difficult to quantify the precision of the noec-loec endpoints between tests . if the data from a series of tests performed with the same toxicant , toxicant-concentrations , and test-species , were analyzed with hypothesis-tests , precision could only be assessed by a qualitative-comparison of the noec-loec intervals , with the understanding that maximum-precision would be attained if all tests yielded the same noec-loec interval . in practice , the precision of results of repetitive chronic-tests is considered acceptable if the noecs vary by no more than one concentration-interval above or below a central-tendency . using these guidelines , the `` normal '' range of noecs from toxicity-tests using a 0.5 dilution-factor ( two-fold-difference between adjacent-concentrations ) , would be four-fold . 9.3.2 point-estimation-techniques 9.3.2.1 point-estimation-techniques have the advantage of providing a point-estimate of the toxicant-concentration causing a given amount of adverse ( inhibiting ) effect , the precision of which can be quantitatively assessed ( 1 ) within tests by calculation of 95 % confidence-limits , and ( 2 ) across tests by calculating a standard-deviation and coefficient of variation . 9.3.2.2 it should be noted that software used to calculate point-estimates occasionally may not provide associated 95 % confidence-intervals . this situation may arise when test-data do not meet specific-assumptions required by the statistical-methods , when point-estimates are outside of the test-concentration-range , and when specific-limitations imposed by the software are encountered . usepa ( 2000a ) provides guidance on confidence-intervals under these circumstances . 9.4 data-analysis 9.4.1 role of the statistician 9.4.1.1 the use of the statistical-methods described in this manual for routine-data-analysis does not require the assistance of a statistician . however , the interpretation of the results of the analysis of the data from any of the toxicity-tests described in this manual can become problematic because of the inherent variability and sometimes unavoidable-anomalies in biological-data . if the data appear unusual in any way , or fail to meet the necessary-assumptions , a statistician should be consulted . analysts who are not proficient in statistics are strongly advised to seek the assistance of a statistician before selecting the method of analysis and using any of the results . 9.4.1.2 the statistical-methods recommended in this manual are not the only possible-methods of statistical-analysis . many other methods have been proposed and considered . certainly there are other reasonable and defensible-methods of statistical-analysis for this kind of toxicity-data . among alternative-hypothesis-tests some , like williams ' test , require additional-assumptions , while others , like the bootstrap-methods , require computerintensive computations . alternative point-estimations approaches most probably would require the services of a statistician to determine the appropriateness of the model ( goodness of fit ) , higher order-linear or nonlinear-models , confidence-intervals for estimates generated by inverse-regression , etc . in addition , point-estimation or regression-approaches would require the specification by biologists or toxicologists of some low-level of adverse-effect that would be deemed acceptable or safe . the statistical-methods contained in this manual have been chosen because they are ( 1 ) applicable to most of the different toxicity-test-data sets for which they are recommended , ( 2 ) powerful statistical-tests , ( 3 ) hopefully `` easily '' understood by nonstatisticians , and ( 4 ) amenable to use without a computer , if necessary . 9.4.2 plotting the data 9.4.2.1 the data should be plotted , both as a preliminary-step to help detect problems and unsuspected-trends or patterns in the responses , and as an aid in interpretation of the results . further discussion and plotted-sets of data are included in the methods and the appendices . 9.4.3 data transformations 9.4.3.1 transformations of the data , ( e.g. , arc-sine square-root and logs ) , are used where necessary to meet assumptions of the proposed analyses , such as the requirement for normally distributed data . 9.4.4 independence , randomization , and outliers 9.4.4.1 statistical-independence among observations is a critical assumption in all statistical-analysis of toxicity-data . one of the best ways to ensure independence is to properly follow rigorous randomization-procedures . randomization-techniques should be employed at the start of the test , including the randomization of the placement of test-organisms in the test-chambers and randomization of the test-chamber-location within the array of chambers . discussions of statistical-independence , outliers and randomization , and a sample-randomization-scheme , are included in appendix a . 9.4.5 replication and sensitivity 9.4.5.1 the number of replicates employed for each toxicant-concentration is an important-factor in determining the sensitivity of chronic-toxicity-tests . test-sensitivity generally increases as the number of replicates is increased , but the point of diminishing-returns in sensitivity may be reached rather quickly . the level of sensitivity required by a hypothesis-test or the confidence-interval for a point-estimate will determine the number of replicates , and should be based on the objectives for obtaining the toxicity-data . 9.4.5.2 in a statistical-analysis of toxicity-data , the choice of a particular-analysis and the ability to detect departures from the assumptions of the analysis , such as the normal-distribution of the data and homogeneity of variance , is also dependent on the number of replicates . more than the minimum-number of replicates may be required in situations where it is imperative to obtain optimal statistical-results , such as with tests used in enforcement-cases or when it is not possible to repeat the tests . for example , when the data are analyzed by hypothesis-testing , the nonparametric alternatives can not be used unless there are at least four replicates at each toxicant-concentration . 9.4.6 recommended alpha levels 9.4.6.1 the data-analysis-examples included in the manual specify an alpha-level of 0.01 for testing the assumptions of hypothesis-tests and an alpha-level of 0.05 for the hypothesis-tests themselves . these levels are common and well accepted levels for this type of analysis and are presented as a recommended-minimum significance-level for toxicity-data-analysis . 9.5 choice of analysis 9.5.1 the recommended statistical-analysis of most data from chronic-toxicity-tests with aquatic-organisms follows a decision-process illustrated in the flowchart in figure 2 . an initial decision is made to use point-estimation-techniques ( the probit analysis , the spearman-karber-method , the trimmed spearman-karber-method , the graphical-method , or linear-interpolation-method ) and/or to use hypothesis-testing ( dunnett 's test , the t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment , steel 's many-one rank test , or wilcoxon rank sum test with the bonferroni-adjustment ) . note : for the npdes permit-program , the point-estimation-techniques are the preferred statistical-methods in calculating-end-points for effluent-toxicity-tests . if hypothesis-testing is chosen , subsequent-decisions are made on the appropriate-procedure for a given set of data , depending on the results of tests of assumptions , as illustrated in the flowchart . a specific-flow-chart is included in the analysis-section for each test . 9.5.2 since a single chronic-toxicity-test might yield information on more than one parameter ( such as survival , growth , and reproduction ) , the lowest estimate of a `` no-observed-effect-concentration '' for any of the responses would be used as the `` no observed-effect-concentration '' for each test . it follows logically that in the statistical-analysis of the data , concentrations that had a significant toxic-effect on one of the observed-responses would not be subsequently tested for an effect on some other response . this is one reason for excluding-concentrations that have shown a statistically-significant reduction in survival from a subsequent-hypothesis-test for effects on another parameter such as reproduction . a second reason is that the exclusion of such concentrations usually results in a more powerful and appropriate statistical-analysis . in performing the point-estimation-techniques recommended in this manual , an all-data-approach is used . for example , data from concentrations above the noec for survival are included in determining icp estimates using the linear-interpolation-method . 9.5.3 analysis of growth and reproduction-data 9.5.3.1 growth-data from the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus , and inland-silverside , menidia-beryllina , larval-survival and growth-tests , and the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia , survival , growth , and fecundity-test , are analyzed using-hypothesis-testing according to the flowchart in figure 2 . the above mentioned growth-data may also be analyzed by generating a point-estimate with the linear-interpolation-method . data from effluent-concentrations that have tested significantly-different from the control for survival are excluded from further hypothesis-tests concerning-growth-effects . growth is defined as the change in dry-weight of the orginal-number of test-organisms when group-weights are obtained . when analyzing the data using-point estimating techniques , data from all concentrations are included in the analysis . 9.5.3.2 fecundity-data from the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia , test may be analyzed using-hypothesis-testing after an arc-sine-transformation according to the flowchart in figure 2 . the fecundity-data from the mysid-test may also be analyzed by generating a point-estimate with the linear-interpolation-method . 9.5.3.3 reproduction-data from the red-macroalga , champia-parvula , test are analyzed using-hypothesis-testing as illustrated in figure 2 . the reproduction-data from the red-macroalga-test may also be analyzed by generating a point-estimate with the linear-interpolation-method . 9.5.4 analysis of the sea-urchin , arbacia-punctulata , fertilization-data 9.5.4.1 data from the sea-urchin , arbacia-punctulata , fertilization-test may be analyzed by hypothesis-testing after an arc-sine-transformation according to the flowchart in figure 2 . the fertilization-data from the sea-urchin-test may also be analyzed by generating a point-estimate with the linear-interpolation-method . 9.5.5 analysis of mortality-data 9.5.5.1 mortality-data are analyzed by probit analysis , if appropriate , or other point-estimation-techniques , ( i.e. , the spearman-karber-method , the trimmed spearman-karber-method , or the graphical-method ) ( see appendices h-k ) ( see discussion below ) . the mortality-data can also be analyzed by hypothesis-testing , after an arc-sine square-root-transformation ( see appendices b-f ) , according to the flowchart in figure 2 . 9.6 hypothesis-tests 9.6.1 dunnett 's procedure 9.6.1.1 dunnett 's procedure is used to determine the noec . the procedure consists of an analysis of variance ( anova ) to determine the error-term , which is then used in a multiple-comparison procedure for comparing each of the treatment means with the control mean , in a series of paired tests ( see appendix c ) . use of dunnett 's procedure requires at least three replicates per treatment to check the assumptions of the test . in cases where the numbers of data-points ( replicates ) for each concentration are not equal , a t-test may be performed with bonferroni 's adjustment for multiple-comparisons ( see appendix d ) , instead of using dunnett's procedure . 9.6.1.2 the assumptions upon which the use of dunnett 's procedure is contingent are that the observations within treatments are normally distributed , with homogeneity of variance . before analyzing the data , these assumptions must be tested using the procedures provided in appendix b . 9.6.1.3 if , after suitable-transformations have been carried out , the normality-assumptions have not been met , steel 's many-one rank test should be used if there are four or more data-points ( replicates ) per toxicant-concentration . if the numbers of data-points for each toxicant-concentration are not equal , the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni 's adjustment should be used ( see appendix f ) . 9.6.1.4 some indication of the sensitivity of the analysis should be provided by calculating ( 1 ) the minimum-difference between means that can be detected as statistically-significant , and ( 2 ) the percent-change from the control mean that this minimum-difference represents for a given test . 9.6.1.5 a step-by-step-example of the use of dunnett 's procedure is provided in appendix c. 9.6.2 t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment 9.6.2.1 the t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment is used as an alternative to dunnett 's procedure when the number of replicates is not the same for all concentrations . this test sets an upper-bound of alpha on the overall-error-rate , in contrast to dunnett's procedure , for which the overall-error-rate is fixed at alpha . thus , dunnett 's procedure is a more powerful-test . 9.6.2.2 the assumptions upon which the use of the t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment is contingent are that the observations within treatments are normally distributed , with homogeneity of variance . these assumptions must be tested using the procedures provided in appendix b . 9.6.2.3 the estimate of the safe-concentration derived from this test is reported in terms of the noec . a step-by-step-example of the use of a t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment is provided in appendix d. 9.6.3 steel 's many-one rank test 9.6.3.1 steel 's many-one rank test is a multiple-comparison procedure for comparing several-treatments with a control . this method is similar to dunnett 's procedure , except that it is not necessary to meet the assumption of normality . the data are ranked , and the analysis is performed on the ranks rather than on the data themselves . if the data are normally or nearly normally distributed , dunnett 's procedure would be more sensitive ( would detect smaller differences between the treatments and control ) . for data that are not normally distributed , steel 's many-one rank test can be much more efficient ( hodges and lehmann , 1956 ) . 9.6.3.2 it is necessary to have at least four replicates per toxicant-concentration to use steel 's test . unlike dunnett's procedure , the sensitivity of this test can not be stated in terms of the minimum-difference between treatment means and the control mean that can be detected as statistically-significant . 9.6.3.3 the estimate of the safe-concentration is reported as the noec . a step-by-step-example of the use of steel 's many-one rank test is provided in appendix e. 9.6.4 wilcoxon rank sum test with the bonferroni-adjustment 9.6.4.1 the wilcoxon rank sum test is a nonparametric-test for comparing a treatment with a control . the data are ranked and the analysis proceeds exactly as in steel 's test except that bonferroni 's adjustment for multiple-comparisons is used instead of steel 's tables . when steel 's test can be used ( i.e. , when there are equal-numbers of data-points per toxicant-concentration ) , it will be more powerful ( able to detect smaller differences as statistically-significant ) than the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni 's adjustment . 9.6.4.2 the estimate of the safe-concentration is reported as the noec . a step-by-step-example of the use of the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni-adjustment is provided in appendix f. 9.6.5 a caution in the use of hypothesis-testing 9.6.5.1 if in the calculation of an noec by hypothesis-testing , two tested-concentrations-cause statistically-significant adverse-effects , but an intermediate-concentration did not cause statistically-significant effects , the results should be used with extreme-caution . 9.7 point-estimation-techniques 9.7.1 probit analysis 9.7.1.1 probit analysis is used to estimate an lc1 , lc50 , ec1 , or ec50 and the associated 95 % confidence-interval . the analysis consists of adjusting the data for mortality in the control , and then using a maximum-likelihood-technique to estimate the parameters of the underlying log tolerance distribution , which is assumed to have a particular-shape . 9.7.1.2 the assumption upon which the use of probit analysis is contingent is a normal-distribution of log-tolerances . if the normality-assumption is not met , and at least two partial-mortalities are not obtained , probit analysis should not be used . it is important to check the results of probit analysis to determine if use of the analysis is appropriate . the chi-square test for heterogeneity provides a good-test of appropriateness of the analysis . the computer-program ( see discussion , appendix h ) checks the chi-square-statistic calculated for the data-set against the tabular-value , and provides an error-message if the calculated value exceeds the tabular-value . 9.7.1.3 a discussion of probit analysis , and examples of computer-program input and output , are found in appendix h. 9.7.1.4 in cases where probit analysis is not appropriate , the lc50 and confidence-interval may be estimated by the spearman-karber-method ( appendix i ) or the trimmed spearman-karber-method ( appendix j ) . if a test results in 100 % survival and 100 % mortality in adjacent-treatments ( all or nothing-effect ) , the lc50 may be estimated using the graphical-method ( appendix k ) . 9.7.2 linear-interpolation-method 9.7.2.1 the linear-interpolation-method ( see appendix l ) is a procedure to calculate a point-estimate of the effluent or other toxicant-concentration [ inhibition-concentration , ( ic ) ] that causes a given percent-reduction ( e.g. , 25 % , 50 % , etc . ) in the reproduction , growth , fertilization , or fecundity of the test-organisms . the procedure was designed for general-applicability in the analysis of data from short-term-chronic-toxicity tests . 9.7.2.2 use of the linear-interpolation-method is based on the assumptions that the responses ( 1 ) are monotonically non-increasing ( the mean-response for each higher concentration is less than or equal to the mean-response for the previous-concentration ) , ( 2 ) follow a piece-wise linear-response-function , and ( 3 ) are from a random , independent , and representative-sample of test-data . the assumption for piece-wise linear-response can not be tested statistically , and no defined statistical-procedure is provided to test the assumption for monotonicity . where the observed-means are not strictly monotonic by examination , they are adjusted by smoothing . in cases where the responses at the low-toxicant concentrations are much higher than in the controls , the smoothing process may result in a large upward-adjustment in the control mean . 9.7.2.3 the inability to test the monotonicity and piece wise linear-response-assumptions for this method makes it difficult to assess when the method is , or is not , producing reliable-results . therefore , the method should be used with caution when the results of a toxicity-test-approach an `` all or nothing '' response from one concentration to the next in the concentration-series , and when it appears that there is a large-deviation from monotonicity . see appendix l for a more detailed-discussion of the use of this method and a computer-program available for performing calculations . section 10 report preparation and test-review 10.1 report preparation the toxicity-data are

test-review should be conducted on each test by both the testing-laboratory and the regulatory-authority . 10.2.2 sampling and handling 10.2.2.1 the collection and handling of samples are reviewed to verify that the sampling and handling-procedures given in section 8 were followed . chain-of-custody-forms are reviewed to verify that samples were tested within allowable-sample holding-times ( subsection 8.5.4 ) . any deviations from the procedures given in section 8 should be documented and described in the data-report ( subsection 10.1 ) . 10.2.3 test-acceptability-criteria 10.2.3.1 test-data are reviewed to verify that test-acceptability-criteria ( tac ) requirements for a valid-test have been met . any test not meeting the minimum test-acceptability-criteria is considered invalid . all invalid-tests must be repeated with a newly collected sample . 10.2.4 test-conditions 10.2.4.1 test-conditions are reviewed and compared to the specifications listed in the summary of test-condition-tables provided for each method . physical and chemical-measurements taken during the test ( e.g. , temperature , ph , and do ) also are reviewed and compared to specified-ranges . any deviations from specifications should be documented and described in the data-report ( subsection 10.1 ) . 10.2.4.2 the summary of test-condition-tables presented for each method identify test-conditions as required or recommended . for wet-test-data submitted under npdes-permits , all required-test conditions must be met or the test is considered invalid and must be repeated with a newly collected sample . deviations from recommended test-conditions must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the validity of test results . deviations from recommended test-conditions may or may not invalidate a test-result depending on the degree of the departure and the objective of the test . the reviewer should consider the degree of the deviation and the potential or observed-impact of the deviation on the test-result before rejecting or accepting a test-result as valid . for example , if dissolved oxygen is measured below 4.0 mg/l in one test-chamber , the reviewer should consider whether any observed mortality in that test-chamber corresponded with the drop in dissolved oxygen . 10.2.4.3 whereas slight-deviations in test-conditions may not invalidate an individual-test-result , test-condition-deviations that continue to occur frequently in a given laboratory may indicate the need for improved-quality control in that laboratory . 10.2.5 statistical-methods 10.2.5.1 the statistical-methods used for analyzing-test-data are reviewed to verify that the recommended flowcharts for statistical-analysis were followed . any deviation from the recommended flowcharts for selection of statistical-methods should be noted in the data-report . statistical-methods other than those recommended in the statistical-flowcharts may be appropriate ( see subsection 9.4.1.2 ) , however , the laboratory must document the use of and provide the rationale for the use of any alternate statistical-method . in all cases ( flowchart recommended-methods or alternate-methods ) , reviewers should verify that the necessary-assumptions are met for the statistical-method used . 10.2.6 concentration-response-relationships 10.2.6.1 the concept of a concentration-response , or more classically , a dose-response-relationship is `` the most fundamental and pervasive one in toxicology '' ( casarett and doull , 1975 ) . this concept assumes that there is a causal-relationship between the dose of a toxicant ( or concentration for toxicants in solution ) and a measured response . a response may be any measurable-biochemical or biological-parameter that is correlated with exposure to the toxicant . the classical-concentration-response-relationship is depicted as a sigmoidal shaped-curve , however , the particular-shape of the concentration-response-curve may differ for each coupled toxicant and response-pair . in general , more severe-responses ( such as acute-effects ) occur at higher concentrations of the toxicant , and less severe-responses ( such as chronic-effects ) occur at lower concentrations . a single-toxicant also may produce multiple responses , each characterized by a concentration-response-relationship . a corollary of the concentration-response-concept is that every toxicant should exhibit a concentration-response-relationship , given that the appropriate-response is measured and given that the concentration-range evaluated is appropriate . use of this concept can be helpful in determining whether an effluent possesses toxicity and in identifying anomalous-test results . 10.2.6.2 the concentration-response-relationship generated for each multi-concentration-test must be reviewed to ensure that calculated-test-results are interpreted appropriately . usepa ( 2000a ) provides guidance on evaluating-concentration-response relationships to assist in determining the validity of wet-test-results . all wet-test-results ( from multi-concentration-tests ) reported under the npdes program should be reviewed and reported according to usepa guidance on the evaluation of concentration-response-relationships ( usepa , 2000a ) . this guidance provides review-steps for 10 different-concentration-response patterns that may be encountered in wet-test-data . based on the review , the guidance provides one of three determinations : that calculated-effect-concentrations are reliable and should be reported , that calculated-effect-concentrations are anomalous and should be explained , or that the test was inconclusive and the test should be repeated with a newly collected sample . it should be noted that the determination of a valid-concentration-response relationship is not always-clear cut . data from some tests may suggest consultation with professional-toxicologists and/or regulatory-officials . tests that exhibit unexpected concentration-response-relationships also may indicate a need for further investigation and possible-retesting . 10.2.7 reference-toxicant testing 10.2.7.1 test-review of a given effluent or receiving-water-test should include review of the associated-reference toxicant-test and current-control-chart . reference-toxicant testing and control-charting is required for documenting the quality of test-organisms ( subsection 4.7 ) and ongoing-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.16 ) . the reviewer should verify that a quality-control-reference toxicant-test was conducted according to the specified-frequency required by the permitting-authority or recommended by the method ( e.g. , monthly ) . the test-acceptability-criteria , test-conditions , concentration-response-relationship , and test-sensitivity of the reference-toxicant test are reviewed to verify that the reference-toxicant test conducted was a valid-test . the results of the reference-toxicant test are then plotted on a control-chart ( see subsection 4.16 ) and compared to the current-control-chart limits ( ± 2 standard-deviations ) . 10.2.7.2 reference-toxicant tests that fall outside of recommended control-chart-limits are evaluated to determine the validity of associated effluent and receiving-water-tests ( see subsection 4.16 ) . an out of control reference-toxicant test-result does not necessarily invalidate associated-test-results . the reviewer should consider the degree to which the reference-toxicant test-result fell outside of control-chart-limits , the width of the limits , the direction of the deviation ( toward increasing-test-organism sensitivity or toward decreasing-test organism-sensitivity ) , the test-conditions of both the effluent-test and the reference-toxicant test , and the objective of the test . more frequent and/or concurrent-reference toxicant-testing may be advantageous if recent-problems ( e.g. , invalid-tests , reference-toxicant test results outside of control-chart-limits , reduced health of organism cultures , or increased within-test-variability ) have been identified in testing . 10.2.8 test-variability 10.2.8.1 the within-test-variability of individual-tests should be reviewed . excessive-within-test-variability may invalidate a test-result and warrant retesting . for evaluating-within-test variability , reviewers should consult epa guidance on upper and lower percent-minimum significant-difference ( pmsd ) bounds ( usepa , 2000b ) . 10.2.8.2 when npdes-permits require sublethal-hypothesis-testing endpoints from methods 1006.0 or 1007.0 ( e.g. , growth-noecs and loecs ) , within-test-variability must be reviewed and variability-criteria must be applied as described in this section ( 10.2.8.2 ) . when the methods are used for non-regulatory-purposes , the variability-criteria-herein are recommended but are not required , and their use ( or the use of alternative-variability-criteria ) may depend upon the intended uses of the test results and the requirements of any applicable-data quality-objectives and quality-assurance-plan . 10.2.8.2.1 to measure test-variability , calculate the percent-minimum significant-difference ( pmsd ) achieved in the test . the pmsd is the smallest percentage-decrease in growth or reproduction from the control that could be determined as statistically-significant in the test . the pmsd is calculated as 100 times the minimum significant-difference ( msd ) divided by the control mean . the equation and examples of msd calculations are shown in appendix c. pmsd may be calculated legitimately as a descriptive-statistic for within-test-variability , even when the hypothesis-test is conducted using a non-parametric-method . the pmsd bounds were based on a representative-set of tests , including-tests for which a non-parametric-method was required for determining the noec or loec . the conduct of hypothesis-testing to determine test results should follow the statistical-flow-charts provided for each method . that is , when test-data fail to meet assumptions of normality or heterogeneity of variance , a non-parametric-method ( determined following the statistical-flowchart for the method ) should be used to calculate test results , but the pmsd may be calculated as described above ( using parametric-methods ) to provide a measure of test-variability . 10.2.8.2.2 compare the pmsd measured in the test with the upper pmsd bound variability-criterion listed in table 6 . when the test pmsd exceeds the upper-bound , the variability among replicates is unusually-large for the test-method . such a test should be considered insufficiently-sensitive to detect toxic-effects on growth or reproduction of substantial-magnitude . a finding of toxicity at a particular-concentration may be regarded as trustworthy , but a finding of `` no toxicity '' or `` no statistically-significant toxicity '' at a particular-concentration should not be regarded as a reliable-indication that there is no substantial toxic-effect on growth or reproduction at that concentration . 10.2.8.2.3 if the pmsd measured for the test is less than or equal to the upper pmsd bound variability-criterion in table 6 , then the test 's variability-measure lies within normal-bounds and the effect-concentration-estimate ( e.g. , noec or loec ) would normally be accepted unless other test-review-steps raise serious-doubts about its validity . 10.2.8.2.4 if the pmsd measured for the test exceeds the upper pmsd bound variability-criterion in table 6 , then one of the following two cases applies ( 10.2.8.2.4.1 , 10.2.8.2.4.2 ) . 10.2.8.2.4.1 if toxicity is found at the permitted receiving-water-concentration ( rwc ) based upon the value of the effect-concentration-estimate ( noec or loec ) , then the test shall be accepted and the effect-concentration-estimate may be reported , unless other test-review-steps raise serious-doubts about its validity . 10.2.8.2.4.2 if toxicity is not found at the permitted rwc based upon the value of the effect-concentration-estimate ( noec or loec ) and the pmsd measured for the test exceeds the upper pmsd bound , then the test shall not be accepted , and a new test must be conducted promptly on a newly collected sample . 10.2.8.2.5 to avoid penalizing-laboratories that achieve unusually high precision , lower pmsd bounds shall also be applied when a hypothesis-test-result ( e.g. , noec or loec ) is reported . lower pmsd bounds , which are based on the 10th-percentiles of national pmsd data , are presented in table 6 . the 10th-percentile pmsd represents a practical-limit to the sensitivity of the test-method because few laboratories are able to achieve such precision on a regular basis and most do not achieve it even occasionally . in determining hypothesis-test results ( e.g. , noec or loec ) , a test concentration shall not be considered toxic ( i.e. , significantly-different from the control ) if the relative-difference from the control is less than the lower pmsd bounds in table 6 . see usepa , 2000b for specific-examples of implementing lower pmsd bounds . 10.2.8.3 to assist in reviewing within-test-variability , epa recommends maintaining-control-charts of pmsds calculated for successive effluent-tests ( usepa , 2000b ) . a control-chart of pmsd values characterizes the range of variability observed within a given laboratory , and allows comparison of individual-test-pmsds with the laboratory 's typical-range of variability . control-charts of other variability and test-performance-measures , such as the msd , standard-deviation or cv of control-responses , or average control-response , also may be useful for reviewing-tests and minimizing-variability . the log of pmsd will provide an approximately normal-variate useful for control-charting . table 6 . variability-criteria ( upper and lower pmsd bounds ) for sublethal-hypothesis-testing endpoints submitted under npdes permits.1 lower and upper pmsd bounds were determined from the 10th and 90th-percentile , respectively , of pmsd data from epa 's wet interlaboratory-variability-study ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2000b ) .
