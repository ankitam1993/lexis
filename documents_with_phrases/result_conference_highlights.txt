'' executive-directors nan heald ( maine ) , patrick mcintyre ( washington ) and jon asher ( colorado ) spoke from the perspectives of a longtime statewide-program ( maine ) ; a state that was reconfigured several years ago ( washington ) ; and , a newly reconfigured statewide ( colorado ) . each provided a perspective on developing a vision , setting-goals and determining-strategies for achieving-access to a full-range of civil legal-services . each emphasized three central-themes : 1 ) the imperative that each state must have a vision that encompasses a full-range of services ; 2 ) the challenge of orienting existing-staff to a new or changing-vision , inculcating the vision and mission within the staff , and , uniting-staff ( old and new ) over a common-vision , whether in a single-office or scattered office-setting ; and , 3 ) the challenge of balancing-vision with fiscal-reality , recognizing that as funds remain static or decline , the need for collaboration-increases and , at the same time , the threat of fractionalization-increases . session ii - group-discussion a group-discussion , facilitated by robert gross and melissa pershing , followed . the discussion provided a forum for participants to share thoughts , challenges and best-practices in the context of developing and fostering a statewide-vision . participants suggested that statewide-program-leadership needed to be able to : • talk consistently and constantly about vision and quality ; • set high expectations for staff ; • delegate appropriate-management-functions so that the executive director can be a visible-leader among staff and the greater equal-justice-community ; • work closely with the state-court-system , and get involved in collaborations ; • build on the program-strengths that already exist ; • seek assistance from experienced-consultants ; • visualize-state-planning holistically ; • know that there are positive-long-term-advantages that ensue from the state-planning-initiative ; • perform environmental-scans for information vital to the creation of a statewide-vision ; • appreciate and respect the differences in office and staff-culture and use them as a genesis for a unified vision ; • think critically about how to unify systems-noting that sometimes-uniformity is necessary , and sometimes it is not appropriate ; • understand that the pursuit of justice is different from the pursuit of access to justice . session iii - press & public relations mauricio-vivero , vice-president of governmental affairs/public relations , presented a session that focused on how programs can develop effective public-relations-campaigns . focusing on the findings of the national russenello-research , mr. vivero encouraged participants to use the media to publicize meaningful-program events . he stressed the importance of getting the right-message out , delivered by the most credible and prominent-spokesperson ( s ) . participants formed small-discussion-groups and brainstormed about events or ideas that could form the basis for a program 's media-campaign . on friday afternoon , the conference-agenda consisted of thematic discussions or mini-sessions that provided an exposition of the state-planning-concept , entitled , `` breaking the concept into parts -client-centered , comprehensive , integrated , statewide . '' session iv -client centered this discussion was co-facilitated by colleen cotter ( indiana legal-services ) and robert gross ( lsc ) and focused on the challenges of creating a service-delivery-model that is client-centered through client-leadership in the state-planning-process and through client-involvement on boards of directors . session v -comprehensive marilyn mcnamara ( new hampshire ) and adrienne-worthy ( west virginia ) facilitated this discussion . it provided a forum for sharing how programs can build bridges with other equal-justice providers and explored the need for creativity in forming-partnerships and collaborations that may consist of unusual associations . session vi -integrated anne milne ( utah ) and roger mccollister ( kansas ) facilitated this discussion on innovative-ways to integrate and combine fundraising to produce a creative resource-development program . vii -statewide norman metzger ( indiana ) and janet millard ( wyoming ) facilitated this session , which included defining the term `` statewide '' and discussion of various statewide-program-models . the session also examined the impact of planning and creation of a vision on pro-bono involvement , leveraging human-resources , and related-service delivery-issues . saturday , february 9 , 2002 viii -technology rhonda lipkin ( maryland ) , victor geminiani ( hawaii ) , nan heald ( maine ) and mike genz ( lsc ) presented this session . 1 ) maryland legal-assistance network ( mlan ) -

michael genz provided an overview of lsc 's technology-efforts : 1 ) the tig ( technology-initiative-grants ) program is developing-templates for statewide-websites . indiana is studying document-assembly-software , and illinois is studying the combination of audio-video conferencing with document-assembly . 2 ) shared national tig grants include the national technical-assistance project ( ntap ) , creation of www.lstech.org , and development of measurement and evaluation-tools , www.legalmeetings.org . 3 ) mr. genz announced the deadlines for this year 's tig requests for proposals . ix -diversity co-facilitated by teresa cosby ( south carolina ) and althea hayward ( lsc ) , this discussion focused on the importance of embracing cultural-diversity , leadership-succession-planning , and the general-expansion of program-leadership , especially as a part of a state-planning-initiative . transformation : an overarching-achievement identified it was obvious from the remarks made by a number of recently merged-states that some kind of critical-phase had been passed . participants recognized that programs were turning or had turned that critical-corner -- from being resistant to or resentful of change to an embracing of new visions by staff , board members and other stakeholders . participants shared-experiences about these transformations and acknowledged the benefits of reconfiguration , as programs complete the critical-work of reorganization . the future participants have already been provided detailed-contact information so that they can network and follow-up with others who attended the conference . lsc asked-attendees to identify what they feel would be the next appropriate-steps . a report of the conference will also be provided to all participants complete with a package containing-handouts . this information will also be shared with lsc 's opp staff . a total of 14 completed evaluations were received from participants . all were unanimous in their praise and appreciation for the statewide-conference , and expressed a desire for an annual or semi-annual-conference of this nature to be held either in person or with the use of videoconferencing . several suggested that separate-break-out-sessions could be developed for long-time statewides and recently merged-statewides , which would allow more time , attention and specifically tailored agendas and discussions for both . it was also noted that not all programs were `` state '' wides and that perhaps there would be value in getting the island programs together ( hawaii , puerto rico , the virgin islands , micronesia and guam ) since they face similar-delivery-issues . • ideas from both attendees and staff for additional-follow-up included : i . regional leadership-conferences - small intense-retreat-like group-meetings of executive-directors plus 1 or 2 identified potential-leaders from each of iv . mentoring/exchange program for newer leaders or leaders who could benefit from exposure to other programs ; v. online leadership-clearinghouse with links to non-profit management and leadership-sites and materials , m.i.e . etc . vi . resources , protocols and guidelines for conducting meaningful statewide-needs-assessment ; vii . more regional-meetings and meetings of `` like '' programs , i.e. , rural with rural , or small with small - for mutual-problem solving ; viii . directory of statewide-programs that includes information such as number of employees , number of offices , amount/percentage/type of funding , level of tech-usage , types of services , collaborations/partnerships , etc . that would allow us to look for a comparable-program to brainstorm a particular-issue ; ix . a place to share materials , information and best-practices documents , orientation-packages , training-ideas . many attendees also asked for additional information on the following-topics : • technology ; technology-innovations ; technology-connecting state government , courts , agencies and programs ; technology as a means of outreach ; technology-use between programs/offices . • resource development/fundraising ideas . • public-relations-initiatives . • internal/staff communications . • ways to establish and maintain a statewide equal-access committee . final-comments ( from one participant 's evaluation ) : '' the real-challenge in legal-services-today is how to change and expand our mission through new and innovative-approaches to the poverty around us . i feel this can be done within the current lsc restrictions but it requires entirely new approaches and combinations of services . i would encourage an agenda that challenges us to change and expand our mission . change is good .
