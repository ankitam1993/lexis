charleston gazette legal-aid campaign fourth of the way to fund-raising-goal paul j. nyden thursday , december 12 , 2002 legal-aid of west virginia announced wednesday that it has already raised $ 300,000 toward a three-year-goal of $ 1.2 million to help its work defending the rights of poor-people . adrienne-worthy , executive director of legal-aid , said her agency will receive $ 400,000 less in federal-funds in 2003 , because the 2000 census found 30,000 fewer poor-people in west virginia . `` we can not meet our needs with previous federal-funding-levels , especially since the economy has worsened since the census was completed , '' she said . today , west virginia has more than 315,000 poor-people , or 18 percent of the state 's entire-population . nearly one of every four children lives in a household whose income falls below federal-poverty-levels . more than 31,000 elderly west virginians also live in poverty . a pamphlet being distributed by the new campaign for legal-aid points out , `` there is only one le gal-aid-lawyer for every 7,900 poor-persons in west virginia . this compares to about one attorney for every 368 persons in the general-population . '' the two co-chairmen of the campaign are lawyers al emch of jackson kelly and scott segal of the segal law firm . emch said on wednesday , `` i have a lot of confidence in lawyers in west virginia , who are professionally-responsible and understand the importance of this project . everyone has a stake in making our justice-system accessible and fair . '' segal said raising-money to help legal-aid is critical `` to help battered-women , people transferring from welfare to jobs in the economy , and the elderly . it is important to guarantee everyone access to justice in the state . '' last year , legal-aid helped more than 9,500 poor-people in west virginia . individuals helped by legal-aid include : a young-mother and her children being abused by a violent-spouse , a severely disabled-child in need of medical care , a young-woman who needed more time in vocational-training to escape welfare , and a woman suffering from dementia in a nursing-home whose husband was trying to strip her of her financial-assets . last year , legal-aid spent $ 387 for work on its average-case . the cost to provide each hour of legal-services was $ 23 . legal-aid also works closely with local-community-organizations , state and local-bar-associations , social-workers and local-government agencies . major-contributors include : jackson kelly ; the segal law firm ; bowles , rice , mcdavid , graff & love ; spilman , thomas & battle ; bordas & bordas ; ditrapano , barrett & dipiero ; the west virginia state-bar ; and hill , peterson , carper , bee & deitzler . anyone interested in contributing to legal-aid 's fund-raising drive may contact them at 922 quarrier st. , charleston , wv 25301 . people may also call 343-3013 or ( 800 ) 642-8279 .
