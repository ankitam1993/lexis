attorneys step up pro-bono efforts as the city 's need for services grows , area 's firms urge partners to volunteer their time . by russ rizzo august 5 , 2002 indianapolis- four years ago , the state supreme court asked-law firms to address a growing-problem : not enough-lawyers were donating-time for pro-bono-work , and thousands of people were left with no legal-help in civil-cases . this year , two of the state 's legal-giants responded . barnes and thornburg , the state 's largest firm , asked all of its lawyers to volunteer at least 25 hours a year helping-low-income people on the clock . the firm 's 335 lawyers now can bill up to 50 hours of pro-bono-work , which is free legal-service for people who can not afford it . `` we 're saying that instead of that week-and-a-half of work for a paying-client , we want you to do this good , important pro-bono-work , and you 're not going to get punished , '' said john maley , who helped create the firm 's policy . `` in fact , you 're going to be rewarded . '' for years , lawyers at ice miller , the state 's second-largest firm , have earned bigger bonuses by clocking pro-bono hours . this year , ice miller organized with the heartland pro-bono council to provide more free-help . a lawyer at the firm receives requests and puts a qualified-person on the job . `` we are sending a message to the lawyers that pro-bono-work is part of their jobs as lawyers , '' ice miller managing partner art kalleres told the indianapolis star for a story published monday . the firms have set an important-precedent for others to follow , marion county superior court judge david j. dreyer said . `` when they say that everybody should do this , that makes it a status-quo-obligation for every lawyer , '' said dreyer , whom the supreme court appointed to boost pro-bono efforts in indianapolis . `` if they do it , that 's what all lawyers should be doing . '' for more than a decade , lawyers at corporations such as cinergy and eli lilly and co. have offered free-help to legal-aid , which handles 8,000 cases a year with five full-time and four parttime lawyers . but large-law-firms just now are getting organized to do similar-work , said john floreancig , general counsel for the legal-aid society , one of two pro-bono organizations in indianapolis . smaller firms also stepped up their efforts . all 35 lawyers at bamberger , foreman , oswald & hahn in evansville agreed to take at least one pro-bono case this year , partner cathy nestrick said . landlord-disputes and divorces are among the most common-types of pro-bono-cases . but the definition of pro-bono-work differs among firms . barnes & thornburg used to include time working for legal-organizations , like the city 's bar-association , maley said . the new policy narrows the definition to providing legal-advice or representation to people who can not afford it . baker & daniels considers time spent helping-neighborhood organizations pro-bono-work . the firm will not set a companywide-goal for all lawyers to meet because free-time varies for each person , burke said . paying lawyers for pro-bono-work is out of the question . `` i think pro-bono ought to be that . it is what you devote to the community and to those in need , '' burke said . `` that there is some sort of financial-compensation there , to me , means it is n't pro-bono . '' no matter what path-firms take to offer more help , indianapolis still has a long way to go to meet the need , floreancig said . `` we could throw as many lawyers as we can get at the poor and still need more , '' he said .
