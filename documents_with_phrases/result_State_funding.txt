state-funding-cuts could reduce free legal-aid indiana : commission looks to fill gaps by pam tharp monday , december 16 , 2002 funding-cuts in free legal-aid for 2003 could mean less access to courts for the poor , but the district 9 pro-bono commission is hoping to fill the gap . indiana legal-services , the primary-provider of free legal-aid in the state , is facing a $ 1.05 million cut in its 2003 budget , said courtney mathews , a paralegal and local-intake-coordinator for indiana legal-services . a drop in population revealed by the 2000 census is responsible for some of the funding-cut , mathews said . the agency also is in danger of losing $ 470,000 over the next 18 months from the violence against women act , but is appealing that decision , mathews said . the cuts have meant staff-reductions in indiana legal services' indianapolis office , eliminating one attorney , two paralegals and one administrator , mathews said . the agency has only about a half dozen-attorneys for 18 counties , mathews said . the other source of free legal-aid in indiana is through district pro-bono commissions established by the chief-justice of the indiana supreme court . under that program , civil-cases for eligible-clients are assigned to private-attorneys who have agreed to participate . union circuit judge james williams , who oversees the district 9 pro-bono commission , is looking for more attorneys willing to volunteer for the program to cover the reduction in indiana legal-services ' staff . the commission will also contribute enough-money next year to pay mathews 15 hours a week , to offset a 40-percent-cut in the richmond legal-services ' office-budget . `` this is an attempt to fill in behind legal-services , '' williams said . `` we 're stepping up our efforts and trying to recruit more attorneys to do pro-bono-work . we only ask that they take on one ( free ) case at a time . '' the commission 's funds come from interest generated by trust-accounts of attorneys who participate in iolta , interest on lawyers-trust-accounts , williams said . attorneys often hold funds in trust for estates , in real-estate-actions or by court order , williams said . the interest on nominal or short-term-client-accounts is now paid to the indiana bar commission , which in january will pay $ 405,000 to 14 pro-bono districts in the state , he said . the districts use the funds to operate pro-bono offices and pay out-of-pocket-expenses for attorneys who volunteer their time , williams said . that source of funding , though , could be in doubt in the future because the u.s. supreme court has agreed to hear a case from the 9th circuit-court of appeals on the constitutionality of using interest earned on client-funds to support legal-services for lowincome-residents . at issue is whether the interest generated properly belongs to the client , williams said . until that question is resolved , interest-funds will continue to help the local legal-services-office . to save money , the office will leave its current-location at 401 s. a st. in richmond and move back to the genesis office at the ywca , which provides support for battered-women . `` we get a lot of referrals from genesis , so that 's a good thing . our present-location , though , was more accessible for anyone who needed services , '' mathews said . twenty-nine-attorneys in wayne , union , fayette , franklin and rush counties participate in providing free legal-services through the pro-bono program , she said . the cases are all civil-cases , primarily dealing with domestic-issues , mathews said . that 's why it 's difficult to find private-attorneys willing to accept them , she said . `` these cases take time and they are n't-easy . there are a lot of emotions involved . but there is a lot of need . because of the cuts , its very important to recruit more local-attorneys , '' mathews said .
