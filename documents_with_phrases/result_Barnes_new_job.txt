atlanta journal-constitution barnes ' new job will improve justice for poor by mauricio-vivero friday , january 10 , 2003 on monday , departing gov . roy barnes will spend his first day as a private-citizen by starting his new job as a full-time , pro-bono ( unpaid ) lawyer at the atlanta legal-aid society . the decision by barnes , the most improbable-casualty of election day 2002 , to go to work for legal-aid was almost as unexpected as his november defeat . as a legal-services-attorney , barnes will help women escape domestic-violence , mauricio-vivero is vice-president seniors fight predatory-lending-scams and parents obtain child-support for their kids . of legal in doing so , he will take his place on the front-line of the u.s. legal-community 's services-corporation , the uphill and underpublicized-struggle to achieve equal-access to justice for millions of washington-americans too poor to afford legal-representation . based nonprofit-corporation chartered by the inaccessibility of the u.s. civil-justice-system is hardly a new development , but it congress in took barnes ' decision to put the national-media-spotlight on our country 's ongoing 1974 to promote equal-access to access-to-justice-crisis . civil-justice . the 2000 u.s. census reports that more than 43 million americans qualify for free federally funded legal-assistance , yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible-clients ( annual-income : $ 11,075 or less ) are able to obtain legal-help when they need it , according to the american bar-association . in georgia , there is just one legal-aid-lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor-people . barnes understood this problem long before he became-governor . while in private-practice , he handled many pro-bono-cases and was a frequent-volunteer in the cobb county-office of the federally funded atlanta legal-aid society . most memorably , he secured a $ 115 million judgment in 1993 against fleet finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior-citizens -- with its widespread predatory-lending mortgage practices . his long-standing-commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable , but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable-act of civic-virtue . to be admitted to practice law , every attorney must take a professional-oath to promote justice -- and every state 's ethical-rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair-play for those living in poverty . in georgia , many law-firms , corporations and private-attorneys are working pro-bono to serve the neediest clients . yet only 23 percent of the state 's 23,598 active-lawyers reported meeting the georgia state-bar 's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono-service in 2002 . the need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county atlanta metropolitan-area , where 70 percent of the state 's poor-people are served by only 24 percent of the state 's lawyers . national pro-bono-participation is even worse . only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in america volunteer even one hour of pro-bono-service annually , according to the aba . shamefully , over the last decade , the average-revenue of the country 's most successful-law-firms has increased by more than 50 percent while pro- bono-hours have dropped by one-third . barnes knows these statistics help explain the unflattering public-image of the legal-profession . speaking to university of georgia school of law graduates at their 2000 commencement , he said , `` the cold , hard-reality is that far too many people face the possibility of an unjust-outcome because they must navigate an often complicated legal-system without the benefit of competent-counsel . why ? because competent-lawyers in the corporate-practice do n't want to get involved . they do n't have the time . they have too many hours to bill . '' sometimes , it seems , we forget that `` justice for all '' is part of our national-creed . i , for one , will not forget president bush's poignant-reminder in the aftermath of sept. 11 : `` we 're in a fight for our principles , '' he told us , `` and our first responsibility is to live by them . '' our democracy will suffer greatly if so many of our nation's poor continue to be priced out of the justice-system . lawyers in georgia and across the country must follow barnes ' lead -- or millions of people will continue to arrive at the courthouse-door to find they can not afford the price of admission . mauricio-vivero is vice-president of legal-services corporation , the washington-based nonprofit-corporation chartered by congress in 1974 to promote equal-access to civil-justice .
