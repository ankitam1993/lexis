united states general-accounting-office testimony gao before the subcommittee on the legislative-branch , committee on appropriations , u.s. senate for release on delivery 10:00 a.m. est may 10 , 2001 fiscal year 2002-budget-request u.s. generalaccounting office statement of david m. walker comptroller general of the united states gao-01-609t mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee : good morning ! as the comptroller general of the united states , it is a pleasure to appear before you today to present the general-accounting-office 's ( gao 's ) budget-request for fiscal year 2002 . i am proud to say that we served the congress and the american people well in fiscal year 2000 . our work resulted in substantial financial-savings and significant-improvements to government that will benefit all americans . i am confident that fiscal year 2001 will be just as productive . at the outset , i want to thank the committee for its support in helping enact gao 's human-capital-legislation . this legislation will go a long way toward helping us address many of our human-capital requirements and ensuring that gao remains prepared to meet the congress ' needs in the future . we have issued implementing-regulations for the early-retirement and scientific and technical-staff provisions and plan to issue authorizing-regulations later this year to guide any potential-future-buy-outs and reductions-in-force . gao 's fiscal year 2002-budget-request is critical to our continuing-efforts to reorganize and reshape the agency , reengineer our business-processes , and train and equip our staff with up-to-date-technology to help meet congress ' current and future-needs . congressional-mandates and requests continue to represent over 90 percent of our work , and our workload and productivity remain at near-record-levels . our budget-request represents our needs -- not wants -- to sustain this level of effort and support to the congress . since becoming the comptroller general at the beginning of fiscal year 1999 , gao 's appropriations have been insufficient to fund mandatory and inflation-expenses associated with employee-compensation and benefits , and make needed-investments in critical-areas , such as technology , training , and performance-recognition . we have managed our resource-shortages by reducing our staffing-levels and underfunding critical-investments . we can not , and should not , continue this trend . the funds we are requesting are essential to helping us remain prepared to meet the complex , controversial , and multidimensional-issues and challenges confronting the congress now and in the future . our request includes only those funds we need to stabilize at our approved 3,275 fulltime equivalent-staffing-level and to incrementally increase investments needed in training , technology , performance-recognition , and other key-support-items to a level consistent with best-practices of other comparable-government and private-sector-entities . before i begin detailing our fiscal year 2002-budget-needs , i would like to highlight some of gao 's accomplishments and achievements in fiscal year 2000 and the major-challenges confronting us . a review of gao 's fiscal year 2000 accomplishments gao had a tremendous-year in fiscal year 2000 . as a result of actions taken on our work by the congress and federal-departments and agencies , taxpayers benefited from over $ 23 billion in financial-savings-a $ 61 return on every $ 1 invested in gao . our work also resulted in significant-improvements in government-operations and services that will benefit all americans . among other things , by acting on our recommendations , the government improved public health and safety , strengthened national security , better protected consumers , and improved its financial-management and information-systems . we also contributed critical-information to public-debates on social-security and medicare reform and called attention to looming-problems , such as the security of government-computer systems and the knowledge and skills needed in the federal-workforce in coming years . other indicators of our performance , such as the number of testimonies our senior executives provided and recommendations implemented , exceeded that of most recent years . i also am pleased to report that we made significant progress toward addressing many of the organizational , human-capital , and information-technology-challenges that i outlined for you at last year 's hearing . we had a very busy and productive year . taxpayers benefit from $ 23 billion in financial-savings in fiscal year 2000 , gao helped achieve about $ 23.2 billion in direct financial-benefits for the american-taxpayer . these benefits are a result of the congress or federal-departments and agencies implementing our recommendations to make government-services more efficient , improve the budgeting and spending of tax-dollars , and strengthen the management of federal-resources . the estimated financial-benefits include budget-reductions , costs avoided , resources reallocated , and revenue-enhancements . these results exceeded our target of $ 22 billion and were greater than that of the previous three fiscal-years , as illustrated in the following graphic . dollars in billions $ 23.2 24 $ 22.0 $ 20.9 $ 19.7 $ 20.1 20 16 12 8 4 0 19 97 1 998 1 999 2 00 0 200 0 target f is cal-years some examples of gao 's work that contributed to these financial-savings include the following . helping to prevent fraud and abuse in medicare : gao had long advocated increased-funding specifically for activities to prevent fraud and abuse in the medicare program . in 1996 , the congress passed the health insurance-portability and accountability act , which provided the additional-funding . as a result of these activities , the medicare program 's net-savings were about $ 3 billion in fiscal year 2000 . cutting-costs of the f-22 aircraft program : in a series of reports beginning in the mid 1990s , gao questioned various-aspects of the air force 's f-22 aircraft-acquisition program . we reported that the acquisition-strategy was risky and that the program was experiencing-cost-growth , manufacturing-problems with test-aircraft , and testing-delays . our analysis helped the congress reduce the final fiscal year 2000-appropriation-request for the f-22 by about $ 552 million and to identify conditions that should be met before the department of defense could begin full-production . supporting-oversight of the internal revenue service ( irs ) : gao continued to support congressional-oversight of irs ' operations , including irs' implementation of the 1998 irs restructuring and reform act , its budget-requests , and administration of various-tax functions . for example , our testimony on irs ' broad-based modernization-efforts provided an integrated-assessment of the challenges irs continues to face in its tax-enforcement and customer-service-operations and its modernization of performance-management , information-systems , and business-practices . at the same time , our work generated savings and potential-reductions in taxpayer-burden . our work on the improved-use of information-returns in irs ' tax-enforcement operations yielded $ 83 million in savings this year . irs also agreed to begin tracking information that has the potential of clarifying its notices to taxpayers and easing their task in complying with those notices . recapturing excess hud funding : gao identified-funding from several-sources in the department of housing and urban development 's budget , including unexpended balances no longer needed , that could be recaptured in fiscal-years 1998 and 1999 . the congress rescinded $ 1.65 billion from the section 8 housing program 's fiscal year 1998 budget-authority and rejected $ 1.3 billion of hud 's fiscal year 1999 request for housing assistance for a total-reduction of $ 2.95 billion . subsequently , gao and hud worked together to revise hud 's analysis to show that , by using recaptured-funds , hud had sufficient-funding to meet its needs . almost 800 actions taken to improve government-operations or services gao 's recommendations and audit-findings also resulted in or contributed to many improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of government-operations and services during fiscal year 2000 . while immeasurable in dollar-terms , they contributed to improving public-safety and consumer-protection , establishing more effective and efficient-government-operations , and safeguarding the nation 's physical and information-infrastructure . we recorded 788 actions taken in response to our recommendations to improve how the federal government operates , a number far exceeding that of the preceding 3 years as illustrated in the following graphic . 788 800 607 620 537 600 number of actions 391 400 200 0 1997 1998 1999 2000 2000 target fiscal year examples of gao 's work that resulted in these accomplishments follow . improving-nursing-home quality of care : the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) and several-states-including california , maryland , and michigan-improved their oversight and enforcement of nursing-homes ' quality of care-standards in response to gao 's recommendations highlighting-weaknesses in existing processes . improvements included increased-funding for nursing-home surveyors , more prompt-investigation of complaints alleging serious harm to residents , more immediate-enforcement-actions for homes with repeated serious-problems , a reorganization of hcfa 's regional staff to improve consistency in oversight , and increased-funding for administrative-law-judges to reduce the backlog of appealed enforcement-actions . managing-wildfire prevention : -federal experts saw massive wildfires coming '' read an august 7 , 2000 , news headline . the article was referring to gao 's april 1999 report on wildfires . since then , gao has used the increased risk of uncontrollable and often catastrophic-wildfires as an example of the need for '' strategic-budgeting '' to address-issues that are not aligned with the current-budget and organizational-structures of the four major federal land-management-agencies . responding to the wildfires that burned over 6.5 million acres of public and private-land in 2000 , the congress appropriated an additional $ 240 million in fiscal year 2001 to reduce hazardous-fuels in high-risk-locations where wildlands and urban-areas meet . gao testified on the need for the four land-management-agencies to act quickly to develop a framework to spend funds effectively and to account accurately for what they accomplish with the funds . improving human-capital-practices : our work on human-capital-issues helped focus the attention of the executive and legislative-branches on the importance of these issues , particularly in managing for results . we helped spur the administration to make human-capital a priority-management-objective in the fiscal year 2001 budget-submission , and our framework for human-capital-self-assessment is being used at other agencies , including the social-security administration , small business-administration , national aeronautics and space administration , and environmental-protection agency . the framework also is used throughout gao to help guide our research and development-work and our congressionally driven examinations of how well agencies are pursuing strategic-human capital-management in support of their missions and goals . we have designated strategic-human capital-management as one of the federal government 's high-risk-areas in our 2001 performance and accountability series and high-risk-update . strengthening-information-security : gao has evaluated the security of critical-information systems at federal-agencies and recommended numerous improvements , most recently at three treasury agencies , the department of energy , department of veterans affairs , and the environmental-protection agency . in september 2000 , gao issued a governmentwide-perspective on federal-information-security that covered inspector-general and gao audit-findings reported since july 1999 . we concluded that weak-security continues to be a widespread-problem that places critical and sensitive federal-operations at risk of tampering , disruption , and inappropriate-disclosure . in october 2000 , government information-security reform provisions were enacted into law to strengthen information-security-practices throughout the government . stabilizing the balkans : despite the presence of two large forces led by the north atlantic treaty organization , the balkans remain volatile . gao's work has shown that the international-operations in bosnia and kosovo face severe obstacles to achieving enduring-peace and stability . most local-leaders and members of their respective ethnic groups have not embraced the political and social-reconciliation needed to build multiethnic , democratic-societies . our work also has shown that the international community has not provided the resources that the united nations mission in kosovo says it needs , particularly for building a civilian-police force . if progress is not made with these matters , violence may escalate or armed-conflict may result . requests for gao testimony and implementation of recommendations increased in fiscal year 2000 , the number of times that gao 's senior executives testified before the congress and the rate at which our recommendations were implemented exceeded that of most recent years . because gao 's primary-function is to support the congress in carrying out its decision-making and oversight-responsibilities , the number of times our experts testify before congressional-panels each year is an indicator of our responsiveness and reflects the impact , importance , and value of our work . in fiscal year 2000 , gao officials testified 263 times before 104 different house and senate committees and subcommittees , more than half of all congressional-committees and subcommittees . our experts testified on a broad-range of issues of national-importance , including-arms-control , health care , social-security , human-capital , nuclear-waste-cleanup , wildfire-prevention , aviation-safety and security , international-trade , computer-security , financial-management and reform , and budget-issues . our assistance to the congress at public-hearings continues to remain high , as illustrated below . however , it is clear that the number of congressional-oversight-hearings and other gao testimony opportunities will decline significantly in fiscal year 2001 as a result of factors beyond our control . among these include the slow start of the 107th congress due to the power-sharing-arrangements in the senate , closer margins and committee-leadership-changes in the house , and delay in filling many bush administration-policy positions . number of testimonies 256 263 270 229 230 182 180 90 0 1997 1998 1999 2000 2000 target fiscal year we also exceeded our performance of previous years with respect to the rate at which the recommendations we made 4 years ago were implemented . we use a 4-year interval because our historical-data show that agencies often need time to take action on our recommendations . by the end of fiscal year 2000 , 78 percent of the recommendations we made in fiscal year 1996 had been implemented . as illustrated in the graphic below , this rate exceeds that of the preceding 3 years . implemented recommendations correct the underlying-causes of problems , weaknesses in internal-controls , failures to comply with laws or regulations , or other matters impeding effective and efficient-performance . percent of recom m en dations im plem-ented 74 7378 80 69 70 60 40 20 0 1997 1998 1999 2000 2000 target fiscal year significant progress made addressing management and operational issues last year , i outlined for you a number of major-management and operational-challenges facing gao . these challenges included human-capital , information technology , organizational , job-processes , and communication-issues within the agency . i am pleased to report that we made significant progress toward addressing many of these issues . we continued to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency through a variety of means during fiscal year 2000 , including issuing a strategic-plan , establishing congressional-protocols , realigning the agency , implementing key human-capital-initiatives , and increasing the use of information technology . these efforts to enhance and strengthen gao and its services to the congress and the american people include the following . in the spring of 2000 , we issued our first strategic-plan for the 21st century based on input from the congress and supplemented by gao 's own expertise and other outreach-efforts . the plan focuses on how we intend to support the congress in helping to shape a more efficient and effective-government . it describes our role and mission in the federal government ; the core-values that guide our work ; the trends , conditions , and external-factors underlying our plan ; and our goals , objectives , and strategies for serving the congress . our intent is to update the strategic-plan every 2 years for each congress . we established a set of congressional-protocols to govern our interactions with and ensure our accountability to the congress . these protocols , which underwent a 9month-pilot-test , set out clear , transparent , consistently applied-policies and practices for gao 's relations with the congress to reduce miscommunication and ensure that all requesters are treated equitably . the final protocols were issued in november 2000 . we continued our outreach-efforts to understand how best to meet congressional-needs and assist the congress in using our resources and services . during each congress , i and other gao executives plan to meet with the leadership of the senate and house , all committee-chairs and ranking-minority-members , and members of our oversight and appropriations-committees to obtain feedback on our performance and information needed to update our strategic-plan . we issued our first-ever accountability report to the congress discussing our performance and accountability in serving the congress and the american people in fiscal year 1999 . the report reviews our accomplishments in meeting our mission and sustaining our core-values of accountability , integrity , and reliability . we also issued a performance-plan for fiscal year 2001 that contains the performance-measures and annual-performance targets we will use to gauge progress toward accomplishing our strategic-goals and objectives . we also realigned the agency to better support the congress and prepare ourselves with current and expected-resource-levels to meet the future-challenges outlined in our strategic-plan . to align gao 's structure with the goals in our strategic-plan , we reorganized both our field and headquarters-operations . the changes were primarily designed to better align our resources with our strategic-plan , eliminate a layer of managerial-hierarchy , reduce the number of organizational-units , increase internal and external coordination-activities with the congress and other accountability-organizations , clarify the roles and responsibilities of management , increase the number of personnel who perform rather than manage or review work , and increase the critical-mass and enhance the flexibility of field-resources . we also began implementing a range of new and enhanced-human capital and information-technology-strategies to position gao for future-success . thanks to the congress , we now have legislative-authority that provides us greater flexibility to effectively manage our human-capital . this legislation , enacted into law in october 2000 , grants us the authority to establish new senior-level scientific and technical-positions ; offer targeted voluntary early-outs and buy-outs ; and carry out reductions in force to downsize , realign , or correct-skills-imbalances within our agency . we have issued implementing-regulations for early-outs and the scientific and technical-positions and plan to issue buy-out and reductions-in-force authorizing-regulations later this year . other accomplishments within the human-capital-area include : completion of a first-ever electronic-knowledge and skills assessment and inventory that is being used to help identify skill-gaps and succession-planning-needs within the agency . in addition , staff completed an employee-preference-survey that is being used along with the results of the knowledge and skills-inventory to meet our institutional-work needs while accommodating-staff preferences for engagements to the extent possible . significant-recruiting and college-relations-efforts on the nation 's campuses . aggressive-efforts are underway to attract , recruit , and hire high-caliber-staff with the skills and abilities needed to assist gao in achieving our strategic-goals and objectives . revised performance-standards for all staff that incorporate gao 's core-values and strategic-goals , update descriptions of performance to better reflect the current-nature of gao 's work , and include key-management and performance-concepts , such as leadership by example , client-service , and measurable-results . also , during fiscal year 2000 , we began a major-initiative to develop a competency-based-performance-appraisal system for analysts to reflect prevailing best-practices . in fiscal year 2001 , we will begin updating the performance-systems for attorneys and mission-support staff to reflect prevailing best-practices . enhanced internal-communications that remain a vital-tool for change-management throughout the agency . throughout fiscal year 2000 , i conducted a number of telecasts to all agency-staff to discuss gao 's strategic-plan and congressional-protocols , client-service , employee-survey-results , initiatives to enhance the agency 's human-capital-programs and legislative-proposals , work-processes , organizational-alignment , information technology , and other areas of interest to the staff . also , to engage our employees more fully in improving the agency 's performance , we established the comptroller general 's employee advisory council to discuss current and emerging-issues of mutual-interest and concern and implemented an employee-suggestion-program that received more than 800 submissions in its first year of operation . we also made significant-gains in strengthening and improving our operations and processes in fiscal year 2000 . we implemented two new management-strategies : risk management and matrix-management . gao 's risk-management-approach allows management to identify and involve key-stakeholders throughout an engagement to transcend traditional organizational-boundaries to maximize institutional-value and minimize related-risks . gao 's matrix-management approach maximizes our value to the congress by leveraging the knowledge , skills , and experience of all employees to ensure the highest quality-products and services and to help the congress address the challenging , complex , multidimensional problems facing the nation . throughout fiscal year 2000 , we also continued to improve our use of information technology as a tool for productivity and knowledge-management . to provide our teams of analysts with a mechanism for simplifying and standardizing their work , we launched the electronic assistance guide for leading-engagements -- the eagle , which is a prototype of a comprehensive webbased-guide to conducting gao engagements . we also continued to enhance the capabilities of our computer-network and successfully made our systems y2k compliant . in addition , we began a number of projects on enabling-technologies , including-software-upgrades , the deployment of notebook-computers , and improved remote-access to allow teams to work more efficiently in the field . also , to carry out gao 's responsibilities under the presidential transition act of 2000 , we developed a separate-section on our internet-web-site with links to key gao contacts and reports on the major-executive-branch agencies , which was completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2001 . fiscal year 2001 plans and future-challenges during fiscal year 2001 , we will continue to focus our work on the major-issues facing the congress , including social-security solvency , education , economic development , medicare reform , national security , international-affairs , and government-management reforms and computer-security . another top priority this year will be working with leaders on the hill to help the congress strengthen its approach to oversight , with an emphasis on looking hard at what government does , how it does it , and the long-term-consequences of today 's policy-choices . gao 's 2001 performance and accountability series and high-risk-update will serve as a solid-foundation for congressional-oversight . also , as i mentioned earlier , we have several key-initiatives in progress to improve how we serve the congress , among them an expanded client-feedback-system ; protocols governing our dealings with federal-agencies ; new high-level advisory-bodies to gain the expertise of business leaders , former cabinet officials , and other experts ; and new avenues for sharing our own expertise with other accountability-organizations . we also are preparing to carry out two new responsibilities mandated by the previous congress . we will chair a panel to review the government 's a-76 process for obtaining-services through competitive-sourcing . also , if the needed-funding is provided , we will review the costs and benefits of major-regulations under the truth in regulating act ( p.l . 106-312 , oct. 17 , 2000 ) . we have a request pending for $ 2.6 million in supplemental-funding for fiscal year 2001 and are requesting $ 5.2 million for fiscal year 2002 to meet the requirements created by the truth in regulating act . internally , we will continue to emphasize initiatives to address our two major-management-challenges : human-capital and information technology . with about 80 percent of our resources devoted to staff salary and benefits , the area of human-capital-presents a major-challenge . a significant-percentage of our workforce is nearing-retirement-age , while marketplace , demographic , economic , and technological-changes indicate that competition for skilled-workers will be greater in the future . with our agency realigned to facilitate our work for the congress and new legislative-authority in hand to manage our workforce more effectively , we are pursuing several-initiatives to strengthen our human-capital . for example , we are recruiting diverse , highcaliber-staff with the skills and abilities we need to achieve our strategic-goals and objectives . we will be putting into place a competency-based-performance-appraisal system and using the results of our staff-knowledge and skills-inventory to help us in workforce-planning . we also have reestablished and are expanding-training-opportunities for our staff-from the senior executives to the new hires . another major-management-challenge is building an integrated and reliable-information-technology ( it ) infrastructure that supports the achievement of our goals . we are conducting a comprehensive it review to identify opportunities to increase our efficiency , effectiveness , and productivity . we also are mapping our business-processes to our it architecture and will link future it investments to our business-goals . in addition , we plan to continue initiatives to increase our employees ' productivity , maximize the use of technology , and enhance the webbased knowledge-sharing applications on the desktop . last , we also must heighten the security of our network . fy 2002-budget-request to fully support the congress as outlined in our strategic-plan and the additional congressional-mandates received since its issuance , we are requesting a budget for fiscal year 2002 of about $ 430.3 million . this funding-level will allow us to support and staff to our approved level of 3,275 full-time equivalent personnel . we will increase our emphasis on areas of congressional and public-interest and , internally , will continue to emphasize initiatives to address our two major-management-challenges : human-capital and information technology . our request also includes $ 5.2 million to carry out new responsibilities created by the truth in regulating act . in addition , we are seeking a nominal-increase in gao 's representation-expenses , from $ 10,000 to $ 12,500 , to accommodate our expanded role with both domestic and international accountability-organizations . additional-funding in fiscal year 2002 is being requested for : mandatory-pay and benefit-costs resulting primarily from federal cost-of-living and locality-pay-adjustments , based on office of management and budget ( omb ) guidance , increased-participation in the federal-employees retirement system , and an increase in the estimated-number of retirees -- $ 17,554,000 ; uncontrollable inflationary-increases in transportation , lodging , postage , printing , supplies , contracts , and other essential mission-support services , based on omb 's 2percent inflation-index and other factors -- $ 1,565,000 ; and uncontrollable contract rate-increases in building-operations and maintenance and information-technology-programs -- $ 1,453,000 . funding of $ 8,004,000 for salaries and benefits also is being requested to staff and support our approved 3,275 full-time equivalent-staffing-level . we plan to use these resources to enhance our review-efforts in areas of congressional and public-interest and concern , such as government-computer-security , social-security solvency , education , economic development , medicare reform , and international-affairs . the additional-funds requested also would be used to continue initiatives begun in fiscal year 2000 that are critical to supporting the congress and the goals and objectives identified in our strategic-plan . these initiatives include human-capital-initiatives and enabling technological-advances to enhance the performance and productivity of our workforce as follows . human-capital-initiatives -- $ 3,324,000 : enabling-technology initiatives to increase employee-productivity , maximize the use of technology , and enhance employee-tools available at the desktop , including such initiatives as reengineering-business-processes , upgrading-hardware and software-applications , expanding our videoconferencing-capabilities , and implementing a best-practices network-security-program -- $ 2,585,000 . other efforts include : enhancing-security and removing-asbestos within the gao building to protect the health and safety of our most important-asset-our staff -- $ 2,839,000 ; upgrading gao 's computer-security-facility to ensure our continued-ability to conduct effective , comprehensive-computer security-controls testing of complex , diverse , and interconnected executive-branch-systems and to attract and retain skilled , technical-staff -- $ 750,000 ; enhancing the international-organization of supreme audit institution 's efforts to combat government related corruption around the world , multi-lateral-training-efforts with eastern-bloc and selected south and latin american-countries , and bilateral assistance to russia -- $ 250,000 ; and contracting for the development of a requirements-document to be used along with other legislative-branch-agencies to jointly procure and share a common financial-management-system -- $ 250,000 . in addition , as previously mentioned , we are requesting $ 5.2 million to provide the annual-funding-requirement specified in the truth in regulating act . budget-request critical to sustaining existing level of service to the congress the resources we are requesting for fiscal year 2002 are critical to addressing our human-capital and information-technology-challenges and ensuring our ability to effectively meet the increasing congressional-requests for gao services . we have reached a point that if sufficient-funding is not received to address these issues and properly support our staff , we will need to take actions that will negatively impact our service and responsiveness to the congress . congressional-demand for gao services continues to increase . for example , as illustrated below , the number of engagements begun as a result of a congressional-request has increased during the past 4 years . these numbers do not include hundreds of other requests that had not yet been started . we have worked hard over the past 3 years with available-resources to significantly increase our productivity-levels to successfully meet increasing congressional-demand . for example , we realigned our organization , reengineered many of our business-processes , retooled our engagement and risk-management-practices , revised our performance-appraisal and recognition-systems , and updated our information-technology-infrastructure . however , we have reached a point that significant additional-productivity-gains are unlikely without sufficient-funding to further enhance our human-capital and information-technology-programs . we are concerned about our ability to continue to increase our productivity-levels , sustain our return on investment , and meet future congressional-demands given the recent-trend in our funding-levels . since becoming the comptroller general at the beginning of fiscal year 1999 , i have not asked for any increase in our approved 3,275 full-time equivalent-staffing-level . i have only requested the funding necessary to properly maintain and support this staffing-level and cover mandatory-expenses , including-inflation and compensation-costs . however , as illustrated in the following graphic , the funding gao received has been significantly less than what we requested and needed to support our approved staffing-level . in order to cover our mandatory-expenses during the past 3 years , we had to staff well below our approved staffing-level , as illustrated below , and delayed or made reduced-investments in important human-capital and information-technology-initiatives . as a result of these funding-shortfalls and the mandated funding-reductions in the mid-1990s , our training , performancebased recognition and rewards-programs are not where they need to be . consequently , we are at a competitive-disadvantage with the executive-branch in some areas , such as performance-rewards . in addition , we have some management-information-systems that are obsolete and incapable of interfacing within our network environment and a variety of software that needs to be upgraded to ensure continued-vendor-maintenance and support . we can not continue down this path . we have reached the point at which investments in these critical-programs and other areas must be made in order to effectively-support our staff and provide the high level of service expected and required by the congress . 3,400 3,325 3,275 3,275 3,275 3,192 3,155 3,000 1999 2000 2001 fiscal-year-ftes requested ftes used the funds we are requesting are critical to addressing our succession-planning-challenges and enhancing the knowledge , skills , and abilities of our workforce . a large-percentage of our workforce will become eligible for retirement within the next 5 years . more than 35 percent of our analysts and 50 percent of our senior executives will be retirement-eligible within that time period . we need to aggressively continue our efforts to hire new staff , develop existing-staff , and otherwise build the future gao . in order to be competitive in attracting , hiring , and retaining high caliber and talented-staff , we need to be able to further enhance our human-capital-programs . thus , the funding we are requesting for training , performance-based-recognition and compensation-programs , education-loan-repayments , mass-transit subsidy-allowance , and enabling-technology is critical . without such funding , we will not be competitive in attracting and retaining the best , brightest , and expertise needed to effectively serve the congress in addressing the complex , controversial , and multidimensional-issues and challenges it faces each year . if the funding-trend of the past 3 years is continued , we will need to restrict our work to only responding to requests from committees and subcommittees , thus severely limiting-and potentially-eliminating-work done for individual-members . such a restriction also would further reduce the limited-flexibility we have to research and develop expertise on emerging-issues , thereby limiting our ability to respond to the congress when related-issues arise on short-notice . for example , were it not for the advance research and development-work we had done on computer-security , china , the world-trade organization , and last year 's presidential election-issues , we would have been unable to be responsive to the congressional-requests and public-debates on these real time , event driven-issues . we need sufficient-funding to build and ensure we have the capacity and expertise to address such emerging-issues on short-notice in the future . s e t f f o r 3,200 e b m u n concluding-remarks fiscal year 2000 was a tremendous-year of accomplishment and achievement for gao œ a year of great-service to the congress and of great-benefit to the american-taxpayer . we have made significant progress in addressing many of the areas in need of improvement in gao and need to continue these efforts . the resources we are requesting for fiscal year 2002 are critical to sustaining our high-level of performance and service to the congress . we are the nation 's and possibly the world 's leading-accountability-organization . we need these additional-resources to continue our efforts to further strengthen gao and be a model-organization for the rest of the federal government and accountability-organizations around the world . in addition , given gao 's impressive-results and return on investment , it only makes sense for gao to receive resource-allocations that are well above average for other federal-entities . to do otherwise would send a troubling-message to gao's employees , the press , and the public . we look forward to your continued-support and working even more closely with you and your staff this year and in fiscal year 2002 . this concludes my statement . i would be pleased to respond to any questions that the members of the subcommittee may have . orders by internet for information on how to access gao reports on the internet , send an email-message with ``
