5 legal-groups at 1 locale to serve the february 3 , 2002 vulnerable salt lake city tribune by edward mcdonough five independent salt lake organizations that provide legal-services to the poor , ethnic-minorities , seniors and people with disabilities have joined together to acquire a west-side-downtown building where they will have their offices . the new community legal center at 205 n. 400 west is a project of `` and justice for all , '' which , until this venture , has been a joint-fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit-providers of free legal-services . `` and justice for all , '' which solicits donations primarily from utah lawyers and foundations , was the first joint-fund-raising campaign of legal-services-agencies in the country , and the community legal center is the first joint-office-project of public-service law groups . the legal-aid society of salt lake , the disability law center , the multi-cultural legal center , the senior-lawyer volunteer project and utah legal-services will share the new facility , and last wednesday their board members were given a tour of the community legal center hosted by staff-members of the five agencies . all of the agencies can share the same reception-area and client waiting-room . the building is close in , across the street from west high and two blocks from the gateway . it has its own parking , something that 's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients . owning and sharing the building and not paying-rent-times five will save the non-profit-agencies about $ 375,000 each year . my assistant , charity christenson , pointed out that the shared-facility will also be efficient for those needing legal-services . no longer will a woman desperate for a protective-order , for example , have to run all over town trying to find the right-agency . after the tour , we found jaye olafson at the cookies and brownies-reception on the first floor . jaye and her husband , erik , own tomax technologies and were the sellers of the building . jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there . the hardwood-floors , wooden-ceilings and brick and stone-interior-walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint . she loves the building , and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space . so they renovated the old sweet candy company building for tomax . the olafsons are delighted with the new owners . the building had been like home , she explained , and so it was important who would be living there . i noted on the donor-list that the couple , through olafson group , had become one of the major-supporters of the project . stewart ralphs , the executive director of the legal-aid society , explained that the community legal center campaign still has a long ways to go , with a bit more than half of the $ 4 million projected cost received so far . there still needed to be furnishings and office-equipment and such . he promised that they would be getting in touch with us later on the subject .
