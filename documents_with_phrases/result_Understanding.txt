understanding where they 're coming from hotline-offers-aid and advice to asian-immigrants who find themselves in desperate-situations and do n't know where to turn . erin chan sunday , july 14 , 2002 kim luu and her six co-workers never see the callers ' faces . they will never meet 42-year-old tranh tran and her cash-strapped westminster family , never hug the terrified 70-year-old woman who has just been evicted and never personally comfort the battered-women seeking-divorces but petrified of losing their immigration-status . but they 've talked . and that 's enough to touch the callers' lives . luu and her colleagues work at a toll-free-hotline , the asian language legal intake project . they use their language-skills and experiences -- luu 's family fled north vietnam when she was an infant -- to add resonance to their advice . with their fluent-vietnamese and mandarin , they help tran understand her family 's eligibility for medi-cal and food-stamps , assist the 70-year-old woman in finding a place to live and advise abused-women how they can stay in the country while staying away from their husbands . through the free-hotline , which officially made its debut last week , luu and other project-employees calm anxious-callers and even elicit laughs from those who do n't know where else to turn . `` these people are desperate for information , '' said juliet stone , 29 , the project 's supervising-attorney . `` this is so needed in the community . '' the project links four legal-service-organizations in los angeles and orange counties -- the asian pacific american legal center , the legal-aid foundation of los angeles , neighborhood legal-services and the legal-aid society of orange county . callers dial ( 800 ) 267-7395 for vietnamese-language-assistance , or ( 800 ) 520- 2356 for mandarin . an employee-records personal information and determines , on the basis of income and place of residence , if a caller is eligible for assistance . after a two-month-pilot-program , the hotline is now in full-operation . plans are to expand the effort to include korean and khmer , the main cambodian-language , by next year . a confused tran called luu a few weeks ago seeking-advice on medi-cal , a term she had heard since arriving two months ago from ho chi minh city , the former-saigon . `` a lot of these people come from an inherently-repressive regime , '' luu said . `` they do n't think of going to the government for assistance and public-benefits . '' luu recorded tran 's basic-information and described medi-cal's medical-assistance-programs , advising tran of her rights and finding a location-close to tran 's westminster home where she could apply . the hotline-staff can elicit information that would be difficult , if not impossible , in english . luu recently spent an hour on the phone with a distraught-woman . `` she just kept crying , '' luu said . `` we have to be extremely patient with them . '' the woman had called the day before she was to be evicted from her apartment . after coaxing-information from the woman , luu called the elder-abuse-hotline . although the woman was evicted , luu's resourcefulness and a social-worker 's efforts found her a place at a senior-citizens-facility . `` we 're looking for a new way of serving the underserved community , '' said bob cohen , executive director of the legal-aid society of orange county . `` anything we can do to get out in the community , to make folks aware of how easy it is to get service , that they wo n't be ripped off , is important ... . `` according to census-data , the vietnamese-population in orange county jumped by nearly 89 % between 1990 and 2000 , while the chinese-population increased by 44 % . in los angeles county , the vietnamese-population rose nearly 25 % in the decade , while the chinese-population leaped by more than 34 % . more than 1.5 million asians and pacific islanders now live in the two counties . many have little or no english-skills . stewart kwoh , president of the asian pacific american legal center , said the idea of a hotline had been tossed around for years . but the latest census-figures and an influx of grant-money convinced center-staff members that the time had come to begin the program . kwoh 's efforts have raised more than $ 300,000 from the open society institute and the community technology foundation of california to anchor the hotline . staff-members have appeared on vietnamese-radio and mandarin television to publicize the program . tran called the hotline after her sister heard luu on bolsa radio , 106.3 fm . the broadcasts have made luu a celebrity of sorts . callers regularly greet her with : `` ms. kim , i have this problem and i need your help . '' in part , hotline-workers gain immigrants ' faith because they understand where their callers are coming from -- literally . when she glances down at the tattoo on her right-forearm , staff-attorney anita le 's forehead furrows in pain at the bold-black letters that spell out `` le quang thai ha . '' that 's the name of the sister who never made it out of vietnam -- who at age 15 , drowned when bullets tore through the boat in which she was trying to escape . `` we never forget where we came from , '' said le , 29 , who arrived in the united states six years after her sister 's death . `` we 're in a vacuum without helping-others . '' stories-stream from luu , too , of how she and her parents fled north vietnam in 1979 . she described how her family sat-waist-deep in water for two weeks on a leaky-fishing-boat to hong kong , how her father gave up his own ration of rice to feed his family , how they settled in louisville , ky. , with $ 100 and a gold-wedding-ring among them . `` right now , i 'm giving back to the community i grew up in , '' said luu , 24 , who lives in alhambra . `` the fact that i speak vietnamese every day reconfirms that i 'm still very vietnamese . `` even though i 'm american , i can relate to them . i understand the depths of their pain .
