( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 the administrator of fsis has concluded that the rule will have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities and an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis and final regulatory-flexibility-analysis has been prepared and included in the notice of proposed-rulemaking and the final-rule-notice , respectively , as required by sections 603 and 604 . the analyses comply with the informational-requirements of the sections including the classes of small-entities-subject to the requirement and alternatives considered to reduce to the burden on the small-entities . the final regulatory-flexibility-analysis discusses the comments received from both the industry and the office of advocacy , small business-administration and the changes made to the proposed-rule to grant regulatory-relief to the small-entities including the sequencing of implementation by establishment-size . gao/ogc-96-31 the analyses use both quantifiable and general-descriptions of the effects of the rule on small-entities as required by section 607 and small-entities , in addition to the actions required by 5 u.s.c . § 553 , participated in the numerous-meetings , forums and conferences held in connection with the preparation of the final-rule as required by section 609 .
