and policy statements 1996-1 ( regarding computer-loan-origination systems ) ; 1996-2 ( regarding-sham controlled business-arrangements ) ; and 1996-3 ( rental of office-space , lock-outs , and retaliation ) '' ( rin : 2502-ag26 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis as discussed below , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) submitted the proposed amendments to regulation x to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for review as a '' significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order 12866 . since the rule was determined to be potentially `` economically-significant , '' 1 hud prepared an economic-analysis , which was also reviewed by omb . according to hud staff , after the economic-analysis was submitted to omb , hud made changes in the analysis to maintain its consistency with the rule , to which minor-changes had been made as described below . these changes were also submitted to omb for approval . the economic-analysis indicates that it is difficult to quantify the costs and benefits of the exemptions for certain employer/employee payments . the analysis also states that hud lacks '' essential-information '' to estimate the economic-consequences of its action with respect to computer-loan-origination systems ( clos ) . however , in both areas , the analysis includes a discussion of cost- and benefit-related-issues and the possible-effects of the changes to regulation x . with respect to hud 's statement of policy on clos , the analysis states that the guidance provided should enable clos to develop with much greater certainty about respa consequences and with few restrictions on reasonable-pricing and compensation . it also states that these actions should lead to faster development of 1in response to our inquiry , omb staff advised that the rule could be `` economically-significant , '' and `` major , '' because it could adversely affect competition . omb also informed us that generally regulation x matters had been designated `` major-rules '' under executive-order 12291 . gao/ogc-96-22 clos , which should ultimately lead to greater consumer and producer-surplus . the analysis summarizes the two other statements of policy issued with the final-rule . in its submission , hud states that its analysis `` reflects [ its ] assessment that ( 1 ) changes in the rule 's treatment of employer/employee payments are desirable to prevent any abuse of the relationship of trust between consumers and providers of settlement-services ; and ( 2 ) the elimination of the exemption for payments by borrowers to clos enhance [ s ] the ability of firms to develop clos . '' ( ii ) actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 in the preambles to the proposed and final-rules , hud states without elaboration2 that `` by approving [ the rule the secretary ] certifies that [ it ] does not have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities , other than those impacts specifically required to be applied universally by the respa statute . `` 3 59 fed . reg . 37373 ; 61 fed . reg . at 29251 . accordingly , under 5 u.s.c . § 605 ( b ) , hud did not prepare initial or final regulatory-flexibility-analyses . sections 607 and 609 of title 5 were also inapplicable . in the discussion of the regulatory-flexibility-act , the preamble to the final-rule-states that hud 's economic-analysis considers the impact of the rule on small-entities . id . in connection with the employer/employee payments exemption , the analysis indicates only that large-firms are likely to find the practice of dedicating an individual to marketing affiliates' products more attractive than small-firms . in connection with clos , the analysis identifies potential-concerns of small real estate firms and lenders , but also sets forth potential-advantages of clos to those entities . section 605 ( b ) states that the certification and explanatory-statement shall be provided to the chief-counsel for advocacy of the small business-administration ( sba ) . in response to our inquiry , hud staff explained that its procedures do not include providing a separate-copy of the certification to sba and that it did not do so in this instance . an sba official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice , and that sba has not objected to it . 2section 605 ( b ) provides that if the head of an agency makes a certification under that section , the agency shall publish such certification in the federal register along with a succinct-statement explaining the reasons for such certification . 3hud staff explained that the exemptions at issue here would not have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities , to the extent that such an impact could be determined . page 2 gao/ogc-96-22 ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 in its submission , hud explains that the final-rule is not likely to result in annual-expenditures of $ 100 million or more by state , local , or tribal-governments in the aggregate , or by the private sector . therefore , sections 202 and 205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1994 are inapplicable . in addition , the final-rule does not affect small-governments or contain a significant intergovernmental-mandate . accordingly , sections 203 and 204 of the act , which require agencies to consult with small-governments and solicit input from state , local , and tribal-governments , are also inapplicable . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . hud promulgated the amendments to regulation x under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . in 1993 , hud determined that a review of certain-policies embodied in the controversial 1992 rule would be useful prior to promulgation of a proposed-rule . 61 fed . reg . at 29239 . therefore , on july 6 , 1993 , hud published a `` notice of written comment-period and informal public-hearing . '' 58 fed . reg . 36176 . on august 6 , 1993 , hud conducted a public-hearing , which produced-testimony and documents from 36 interested parties ; in addition , hud received 1,526 comments on the matters at issue . 61 fed . reg . at 29240 . hud published a proposed-rule on july 21 , 1994 . 59 fed . reg . at 37360 . in the preamble to the proposed-rule , hud discussed the comments received in response to its july 6 , 1993 solicitation and invited further comments . see 59 fed . reg . at 37360 , 37362-73 . in addition , following-promulgation of the proposed-rule , hud conducted an open-house for operators of clos . the open-house was designed to allow operators to demonstrate their systems to hud and to the public . 61 fed . reg . at 29240 . further , in august and september 1995 , hud convened two working-group-meetings of interested-industry , government , and public-officials to obtain their input and to further explore the status of clos . id . according to the preamble to the final-rule , hud received 354 comments on the proposed-rule . id . at 29241 . throughout the preamble to the final-rule , hud discusses and responds to issues raised during the comment-period , as well as the information gathered during the open-house and subsequent working-group sessions . see 61 fed . reg . at 29241-51 . page 3 gao/ogc-96-22 paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the final-rule continues a requirement that , in controlled business-situations , people making-referrals of settlement-services make certain-disclosures to those being referred . under the paperwork reduction act , these disclosure-requirements are to be submitted by hud to omb for approval . hud had believed that the controlled-business-disclosure requirements were included in a respa information-collection submission last approved by omb on may 6 , 1994 ( 2502-0265 ) . the final-rule did not substantially modify the requirements for the controlled-business-disclosure and , therefore , hud did not submit the disclosure-requirements to omb in connection with this rulemaking . hud has discovered that the controlled-business-disclosures , which are mandated in section 8 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( a ) of respa , 12 u.s.c . § 2607 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( a ) , were omitted from the respa submission approved by omb in 1994 . hud has begun to take the steps necessary to rectify this problem , including-preparation and publication of a correction to the final-rule and proper-submission of the controlled-business-disclosure requirements for omb review and public-comment . statutory-authorization for the rule hud promulgated these amendments to regulation x and accompanying-statements of policy under the authority in section 19 of respa , 12 u.s.c . § 2617 . section 8 ( c ) ( 5 ) of respa , 12 u.s.c . § 2607 ( c ) ( 5 ) , permits hud to exempt `` other payments or classes of payments '' from respa 's prohibition on compensated referrals , after consulting with specified federal-agencies . section 19 ( a ) , 12 u.s.c . § 2617 ( a ) , authorizes hud to grant `` reasonable-exemptions for classes of transactions , as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of [ respa ] . '' the preamble to the final-rule-states that hud consulted with other federal-agencies , as required by section 8 ( c ) ( 5 ) . 61 fed . reg . at 29245 . national environmental policy act of 1969 the preambles to both the proposed and final-rules reflect hud's finding that the rule will not have a significant impact on the environment . 59 fed . reg . at 37373 ; 61 fed . reg . at 29251 . accordingly , hud did not prepare an environmental-impact-statement in connection with this rule . executive-order 12866 omb reviewed the amendments to regulation x and accompanying-statements of policy under executive-order 12866 as a `` significant regulatory-action . '' hud staff advised that , after submission to omb , hud made technical , editorial , and clarifying-changes to the rule , which omb also approved . page 4 gao/ogc-96-22 other executive-orders in response to our inquiry , hud staff advised that hud reviewed the rule under executive-order 12988 ( civil-justice-reform ) . we note that the final-rule does clearly specify its affects on existing-regulations . in addition , the preambles to the proposed and final-rules address executive-orders 12612 ( federalism ) and 12606 ( the family ) . with respect to the federalism order , they state that hud has determined that the policies contained in the rule will not have substantial direct-effects on states or their political-subdivisions , or the relationship between the federal government and the states , or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various-levels of government . as a result , the rule is not subject to review under that order . with respect to the family order , the preambles similarly state hud's determination that the rule does not have the potential for a significant impact on family-formation , maintenance , and general-well-being , and , thus , is not subject to review under the order . 59 fed . reg . at 37373-4 ; 61 fed . reg . at 29251 . further , the executive-orders on property rights ( 12630 ) , intergovernmental-partnership ( 12875 ) , and environmental-justice ( 12948 ) are similarly inapplicable . in its submission , hud did not identify any other statute or executive-order imposing procedural-requirements relevant to the rule . page 5 gao/ogc-96-22
