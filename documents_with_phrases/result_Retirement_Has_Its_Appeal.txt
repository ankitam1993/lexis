retirement has its appeal lawyers form group to offer legal-aid to indigent-clients christine mcconville sunday , january 26 , 2003 it started out as one of those talks-people have at the end of a summer-day . two years ago , former middlesex county judge edward ginsburg and his cousin were sitting by the edge of a pond in new hampshire , discussing his approaching 70th-birthday . `` i do n't believe in retirement . i do n't like that term , '' said ginsburg , recalling that day 's conversation . having reached the court-system 's mandatory-retirement-age , the lifelong newton resident left the courtroom . but he has taken on another full-time venture - turning into reality a vision he and his cousin had on that summer-day . senior-partners for justice is less than four months old , but already ginsburg has some of the city 's top-lawyers working for some of the region 's poorest clients . the lawyers provide expert legal-service for indigent-people who need help with divorces , custody-battles , and other family-law-matters . one case has already been settled ; 13 others are in the works . the initiative is his response to a pattern he noticed during his 25 years as a family-court-judge . `` there 's a disconnect between lawyers and the people who need their services . sixtyfive-percent of the people in probate-court appear without lawyers because they ca n't afford them . `` i have a friend who says that going into court without a lawyer is like going to a foreign-country without a guide . sometimes the people who represent themselves do n't even know the significant-facts of their case . `` this is an effort to do something about that , while giving older , retired-lawyers a chance to stay active , '' he said . `` it helps the courts by giving them attorneys to argue the cases , too . '' so far , ginsburg , who works out of an office on longfellow-place in boston , has recruited 30 lawyers , including a 91-year-old lawyer from cape cod , a retired-judge , and an expert on dividing-pensions after a divorce . former newton mayor thomas b. concannon has signed on , along with lawyers from lowell , andover , weston , and wayland . retired-judge herbert hershfang just settled the group 's first case , a divorce . `` it was n't complicated , '' hershfang said of the case . but he supports the cause , partly because as a judge at boston municipal court and other courtrooms , hershfang witnessed firsthand how many people ca n't afford lawyers . `` judge ginsburg is to be commended for filling a really-important need in our court-system , '' hershfang said . `` he had done a wonderful-job as a judge , and then as soon as he leaves , he fills this need . '' to ginsburg , it 's just the right-idea , at the right-time . `` i think it 's voltaire who said , 'there 's nothing more powerful than an idea that has come of age . ' `` everything just fell into place , and i thought , 'i 've got to seize the opportunity and run with it , ' `` said ginsburg , who names former-president jimmy carter as a role-model . `` most presidents retired , and what happened to them ? they fade away , but i think [ carter ] had more influence after his presidency . '' the participating-lawyers say ginsburg , a diehard red sox fan known for his trademark-bow-ties , is tough to turn down . concannon , who at 63 is still practicing full-time , said he could n't say no to ginsburg , a longtime-friend . `` he fished me in , '' concannon said , adding , `` people need lawyers , and there 's a growing-amount of poor that need pro-bono-services . '' the volunteer-lawyers project of the boston bar-association supplies the clients . that group 's executive director , meg connolly , said all the cases are screened first , to make sure they have legal-merit and that the client meets federal-poverty-guidelines . that means that an individual ca n't earn more than $ 11,075 a year , and that a family of four may not earn more than $ 33,938 , she said . connolly said her program has been working to provide free legal-services for 25 years , and the demand is n't abating . having someone like ginsburg working on the same problem helps out . `` he has the cachet of being a long-standing family-court-judge , and lots of people like him , '' she said . ginsburg has a lifetime of connections to tap , `` and he 's an expert-tapper , '' said jack reilly , executive director of massachusetts continuing legal-education inc . the agency hosts training seminars the first wednesday of each month to keep the group 's members up to date on marital-law and family-court-issues . reilly said he has been stunned at the number of people who have been showing up . `` for a lot of people in the legal-services , the initial-reaction [ to the program ] was : 'been there , done that ; does n't work . ' `` but based on the force of [ ginsburg 's ] personality , and that he 's at the office every day , he 's gotten some very senior-people on board , '' reilly said . `` you do n't realize you want to do this until he talks to you . '' the lawyers who are participating , reilly said , `` still want to have an intellectual-experience , and they want to be part of the legal-community . `` and , '' he said , `` i 'm sure their spouses are delighted to push them out of the house the first wednesday of every month .
