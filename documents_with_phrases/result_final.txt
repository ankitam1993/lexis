i . the president 's approach - building on success the president 's energy plan includes a number of conservation , advanced-research and development , and other efforts that will reduce electricity-usage . reducing the amount of electricity we use and the amount of fuel needed to produce it are part of the answers to the challenge of providing-energy in an environmentally responsible way . the president 's energy plan goes even further . the president has directed me to develop proposed legislation that would significantly reduce and cap nox , so2 and mercury-emissions from power-generation . such a program ( with appropriate-measures to address local-concerns ) would provide significant-health-benefits even as we increase electricity-supplies . the proposed legislation will : - establish reduction-targets for emissions of so2 , nox and mercury , - phase in reductions over a reasonable-time-period , similar to the successful acid-rain-program established by the 1990 amendments to the clean-air act and to state-programs , - provide regulatory-certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation , and - provide market-based-incentives , such as emissions-trading , to help achieve the required-reductions . nationwide-reductions of the three emissions , so2 , nox and mercury , in an integrated-approach would result in key-benefits including-thousands of avoided premature-deaths and aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular-illness due to fine-particles , reduced hospitalization and emergency-room-visits due to fine-particles and continued-exposure to ground-level-ozone . it would also address interstate-transport-issues as they relate to meeting the new particulate-matter and ozone air-quality-standards . visibility-improvement would be anticipated over large-areas including national-parks and wilderness-areas and recovery of many freshwater and coastal-ecosystems would be likely . public health-risks associated with mercury , particularly those posed to children and women of child-bearing-age , may be reduced . this includes risks of neurotoxic-effects such as mental-retardation , cerebral-palsy , difficulty speaking and hearing-others , and other learning-disabilities . currently , current forty plus states have fish advisories ; that number would be reduced . the president 's approach builds on the acid-rain-program , which provides a wonderful-model for future-programs . it has not only met expectations , but exceeded them . administering the acid-rain-program has been a cost-effective-experience . the program will achieve about 40 % of the total-emission-reductions required under the 1990 clean-air act amendments at a low-cost to industry and to the government . the program is administered with a relatively-small staff relying on strong and state-of-the-art-data-tracking and reporting-capabilities . when president george h.w . bush signed the clean-air act amendments of 1990 , it revolutionized clean-air-policy regarding regional and national air-pollution issues and drove environmental-protection in new directions . first , the president and congress designed the acid-rain-program to focus on reducing the so2 emissions that cause-acid-deposition and translated the emission-reduction-goal into a nationwide-cap on emissions from electric generating-sources . second , congress provided epa with a tool to achieve this reduction - - an innovative-market-based-allowance trading-program . this `` cap-and-trade '' approach provided greater certainty that the emissions-reductions would be achieved and sustained while at the same time allowing-industry unprecedented flexibility in how to achieve the needed emission-reductions . in return for this flexibility , sources were to provide a full-accounting of their emissions through continuous-monitoring and reporting , and there would be consequences for failing to comply . the objective was for sources to find the most cost-effective-means for limiting so2 emissions and to be responsible for achieving those emission-reductions . there would be no government-second-guessing and lengthy-permit-reviews . compliance with the acid-rain-program began in 1995 and is now in its seventh-year . it has been a resounding-success , with so2 emissions from power-generation dropping 4.5 million tons from 1990 levels and nox-emissions down 1.5 million tons from 1990 levels ( about 3 million tons lower than projected growth ) . in addition , during the first phase of the program ( 1995-1999 ) , so2 emissions were between 20 to 30 percent below their allowable-levels . furthermore , environmental-monitoring-networks tracked important environmental-improvements - - acid-deposition was reduced by up to 30 percent in certain-areas of the country . and , these environmental-improvements cost less than predicted because of the built-in-market based incentives . in 1990 , epa projected the cost of full-implementation of the so2 emissions-reduction with trading at $ 5.7 billion per year ( 1997 dollars ) . in 1994 , gao projected the cost at $ 2.3 billion per year ( 1997 dollars ) . recent-estimates of annualized cost of compliance are in the range of $ 1 to $ 1.5 billion per year at full-implementation . president bush has not only promised to take the so2 trading-program to the next level but he has experience to lend to the matter . in 1999 , then-governor bush signed-legislation that permanently caps nox and so2 emissions from older power plants in texas starting in 2003 and requires utilities to install a certain-quantity of renewable and clean-energy-capacity by 2009 . environmental defense hailed this legislation as a model for the country . the emission banking and trading of allowances program is expected to achieve substantial-reductions when it is fully phased in by 2003 . it is estimated that this program will reduce nox by 75,000 tons per year and so2 by 35,000 tons per year . it is designed to give the utilities-flexibility in determining how and where to achieve the reductions . allowances are allocated to each power plant based on 1997 emissions using a formula that does not penalize the `` clean '' plants that already have a low nox or so2 emission-rate . permitted power generating-plants may opt into the trading-program . ii . regulating-emissions from power-generation the president 's legislative-approach stands in sharp-contrast to the complex-web of existing-regulations which currently confront the industry . over the years , congress , epa and the states have responded to specific environmental and public-health-problems by developing separate regulatory-programs for utilities to address the specific-problems . each individual-program uses its own approach to serve its own purpose . as i describe the different regulatory-programs , i think you will understand why we believe it is time to simplify . if we have a new legislation that significantly reduces emissions of so2 , nox and mercury , we can eliminate many of the individual-programs that apply to the power-generation-sector and replace them with a system that will reduce the administrative-burden on industry and governments , use market-based-incentives to keep compliance-costs low , and provide the industry with more certainty about its future regulatory-obligations . there are many regulatory-initiatives in place that will lead to reductions in air-emissions from electric-power-generation . these regulations include both federal and state requirements that address a variety of emissions including so2 , nox , co , pm10 , and a number of hazardous-air-pollutants . the requirements also vary depending on the characteristics of the generating-facility , including its boiler-type , size , age and location . these programs include the national-ambient-air quality-standards for particulate-matter and ozone , the section 126 and the nox sip-call rules , new source-review and new source-performance-standards , the regional-haze-rule and mercury-regulation as a hazardous-air-pollutant , among others . epa has set national-ambient-air quality-standards ( naaqs ) for six pollutants : ozone , carbon-monoxide ( co ) ; particulate-matter ( pm ) ; so2 ; no2 ; and lead ( pb ) . the clean-air act calls upon states to adopt emissions-control-requirements in the form of state-implementation-plans ( `` sips '' ) to bring nonattainment-areas into compliance with the naaqs . historically , most states ' strategies to attain the so2 and pm naaqs included power plant controls . epa has taken two actions to address the contribution of interstate-transport of nox-emissions to downwind ozone-nonattainment-problems , and both of these actions affect the power-sector . in 1998 , epa finalized the nox sip-call , which now requires 19 states and the district of columbia ( whose emissions significantly contribute to downwind ozone-nonattainment-problems ) to revise their sips to control summertime-nox-emissions . in response , all of these states are choosing-control-strategies that focus on reducing power-plant-emissions . in a separate-action aimed at the same interstate nox transport-problem , in january 2000 , epa finalized a rule which was issued in response to petitions from several northeastern-states under section 126 of the caa . in this rule , epa found that emissions from large electric-generating-units and large industrial-boilers and turbines in 12 states and the district of columbia are significantly contributing to downwind states ' ozone-nonattainment-problems . the rule requires these sources to control their summertime-nox-emissions under the federal nox budget-trading-program beginning may 1 , 2003 . the electric-power-generation sector is also regulated through a variety of traditional and innovative-programs . consistent with the clean-air act , many states have adopted nox reasonably-available control-technology-requirements for combustion-facilities . in addition , several-states have adopted market-based-approaches . the south coast air-quality management district in southern california , for example , adopted a nox and so2 emissions-trading-program ( called reclaim ) . the northeast and mid-atlantic states that comprise the ozone-transport region have developed a region-wide nox-emissions trading-program ( the ozone-transport commission nox budget program ) . the revised ozone-naaqs and new pm2.5 naaqs could lead to further regulation of power plant so2 emissions ( a precursor to ambient pm2.5 ) and nox-emissions ( both for pm2.5 and ozone-attainment-strategies ) . the act also requires state-implementation-plans to include a preconstruction permit-program for new or modified major-stationary-sources , referred to as new source-review ( `` nsr '' ) . this program ensures that when large , new facilities are built -- or major-modifications to existing-facilities are made that result in a net emissions-increase -- they include state-of-the-art-air-pollution control-equipment . it also assures citizens who live near new major-sources of air-pollution that the facilities will be as clean as possible . the requirements are different for ( 1 ) the part of the program called the prevention of significant-deterioration-program that applies to construction-projects in areas where the air is already-clean , and ( 2 ) the part of the program called the non-attainment nsr program that applies to construction-projects in areas where the air is unhealthy to breathe . for attainment-areas , to prevent significant-deterioration of our nation 's air-quality , new major-sources and major-modifications to existing-sources must apply the best-available control-technology and ensure that the new pollution introduced into the environment does not adversely impact the air-quality , such as in pristine-areas like national-parks . for nonattainment-areas , in addition to applying-control-technology that represents the lowest achievable-emission-rates , new major-sources and major-modifications must offset their emissions increases . this can be done by getting-reductions from other sources in the general-area to compensate for the increases resulting from the new air-pollution-sources . the act also requires epa to establish new source-performance-standards ( `` nsps '' ) that all new or modified sources must meet regardless of their location . the nsps are technology-based numerical-performance-standards that apply to all sources in a particular-source-category , such as electric-utility-steam generating-units or stationary-gas-turbines . these standards are intended to `` level the playing field '' so that all new facilities install a minimum-amount of air-pollution-control equipment . the recently finalized regional-haze-rule will also require power-generators to reduce so2 and nox-emissions either through the implementation of best-available retrofit-technology ( bart ) or a trading-program yet to be developed . states must show `` reasonable progress '' in their state-implementation-plans toward the congressionally mandated goal of returning to natural-conditions in national-parks and wilderness-areas . epa is developing a rule to limit mercury-emissions from utilities . the 1990 caa amendments required epa to study and prepare a report to congress on the hazards to human-health that can reasonably be expected to occur as a result of emissions of hazardous-air-pollutants ( air-toxics or haps ) from fossil fuel-fired electric-power-plants . based on the report to congress and on other available-information , epa found in december 2000 that air-toxics-control is appropriate for coal-fired and oil-fired utility-boilers . as a result of that regulatory-determination , epa is scheduled to propose `` maximum achievable-control-technology '' ( mact ) standards for these source-categories by 2003 . given the conclusions of the report , the regulation is likely to focus on mercury-emissions . the utility-industry is also required to reduce so2 emissions through the acid-rain trading-program described above . in addition , to address acid-rain , the clean-air act requires utilities to reduce their emissions through emissions-limits , which epa established based on unit-type . iii . health and environmental-benefits of the president's energy plan the president 's energy plan recognizes that by conserving-energy and limiting nox , so2 and mercury-emissions , we can provide the country with significant public health and environmental-benefits . the problems we would address include : fine-particle-pollution , visibility-degradation , ozone-pollution , mercury-deposition , acid-rain , nitrate-deposition and climate-change . in turn , this will avoid incidences of premature-mortality , aggravation of respiratory and cardiopulmonary-illnesses , and diminished-lung-function which results in lost work-days , school-absences and increased hospitalizations and emergency-room-visits , and will also avoid damage to eco-systems , fish and other wildlife . to understand the tremendous-benefits of the president 's plan , we need to understand the public health and environmental-issues . emissions from power-generation power-generators are a significant-source of three key-emissions : sulfur-dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen-oxide ( nox ) , and mercury ( hg ) . the clean-air act has been , and will continue to be , a successful-tool in reducing these emissions . however , while we are observing significant environmental-improvement , power-generation still contributes 67 % of so2 , 25 % of nox , and 37 % of man-made-mercury . ( power-generation has other emissions , such as carbon-monoxide and coarse-particles , but the level of these emissions poses smaller risks for public health and the environment . ) one of the reasons-power-generation accounts for such a large-share of these key-emissions is that significant-emissions-reductions have already been required from other sources . for example , a new car-today is more than 90 % cleaner than it was before federal-laws limiting-emissions of co , nox and volatile organic-compounds - and they are subject to further reductions starting in 2004 , as are heavy-duty-trucks in 2007 . in contrast , some older power plants , built before certain federal-performance standards were put into place , are still operating without modern pollution-control-equipment for some emissions . air-quality effects fine-particle-pollution : the president 's energy plan will reduce fine-particle-pollution . so2 and nox-emissions from power-generation react in the atmosphere to form nitrates and sulfates , which are a substantial-fraction of fine-particle ( pm2.5 ) pollution . ( some pm2.5 comes from direct emissions from a variety of sources . ) a source emitting nox and so2 can cause pm2.5 many miles away . a substantial-body of published scientific-literature recognizes a correlation between elevated fine particulate-matter and increased-incidence of illness and premature-mortality . the health-impacts include aggravation of chronic-bronchitis , hospitalizations due to cardio-respiratory-symptoms , emergency-room-visits due to aggravated asthma-symptoms , and acute-respiratory symptoms . based on these findings , epa and others estimate that attaining the fine-particle-standards would avoid thousands , and up to tens of thousands , of premature-deaths annually . the significant-expansion in scientific-research in recent years has enhanced our understanding of the effects of particles on health . epa is summarizing all new information in the ongoing-review of the particulate-matter-standard in a `` criteria-document '' that will undergo extensive-peer and public-review . • visibility and regional-haze impacts : the president 's energy plan will improve visibility by reducing so2 and nox-emissions . sulfates and nitrates that form in the atmosphere from so2 and nox-emissions are significant-contributors to visibility-impairment in many national-parks and wilderness-areas , as well as urban-areas across the country . sulfates are a key-factor in all areas of the united states , particularly in the east , where high humidity increases the light-extinction-efficiency of sulfates . sulfates are responsible for 6080 % of total-light extinction in the east , based on data collected during the 1990's in eastern national-parks such as acadia , everglades , great smoky mountains , shenandoah , and in washington , dc . in the west , sulfates account for approximately 25-50 % of visibility-impairment . nitrates can play a larger role in visibility-problems in some portions of the west than in the east . for example , nitrates account for 20-40 % of visibility-impairment in national-parks and wilderness-areas in southern california . in many urban-areas , nox-emissions from cars , trucks , and power plants contribute to winter-time `` brown-cloud '' situations . c ozone : the president 's energy plan will reduce ozone by reducing nox , a key-contributor to the formation of ground-level-ozone . in the presence of sunlight , nox and volatile organic-compounds react photochemically to produce ozone . nox can be transported long distances and contribute to ozone many hundreds of miles from its source . more than 97 million people live in areas that do not yet meet the health-based 1-hour ozone standard ( based on 1997-1999 data ) . the number would be even higher for the new 8-hour ozone standard . reducing-ozone levels will result in fewer hospitalizations , emergency-room and doctors-visits for asthmatics , significantly fewer incidents of lung-inflamation for atrisk populations , and significantly fewer incidents of moderate to severe respiratory-symptoms in children . not only will reducing-ozone provide public-health-benefits , but it will avoid damage to ecosystems and vegetation . ozone causes decreased agricultural and commercial-forest-yields , increased-mortality and reduced-growth of tree-seedlings , and increased-plant susceptibility to disease , pests , and environmental-stresses ( e.g. , harsh-weather ) . since nox-emissions result in formation of ground-level-ozone , reducing nox-emissions will reduce ozone-levels and thus reduce the deleterious-effects of ozone on human-health and ecosystems . deposition-effects c mercury : the president 's energy plan will benefit public health by reducing-mercury air-emissions . mercury is highly-toxic in small-quantities and americans with diets with high levels of mercury are at risk for adverse-health-effects . mercury is a naturally occurring-element , but human-activity mobilizes mercury in the environment , making it more bioavailable . after mercury is emitted to the air , it can be transported through the atmosphere for days to years before being deposited into water-bodies . once mercury is deposited in lakes , rivers , and oceans , it bioaccumulates in the food-chain , resulting in high concentrations in predatory-fish . in the u.s. , most human-exposure to mercury is the result of consumption of fish contaminated with methylmercury . a recent-report of the national academy of sciences ( nas ) concluded that while most americans face a very low-risk from methylmercury , children of women who consume large amounts of fish during pregnancy face a much higher risk . fetuses are particularly-vulnerable to methylmercury because of their rapidly developing nervous-systems . these effects include cognitive , sensory , and motor-deficits . the nas study estimates as many as 60,000 children annually may develop neurological-problems because of low-level methylmercury-exposure through their mother prior to birth . forty-one-states have advisories warning the public to restrict eating-fish from local-waters due to methylmercury . epa estimates that 5.6 million acres of lakes , estuaries and wetlands and 43,500 miles of streams , rivers and coasts are impaired by mercury-emissions . acid-rain : the president 's energy plan will reduce acid-rain by reducing so2 and nox . acidic-deposition or `` acid-rain '' occurs when so2 and nox in the atmosphere react with water , oxygen , and oxidants to form-acidic-compounds . these compounds fall to the earth in either dry-form ( gas and particles ) or wet-form ( rain , snow , and fog ) . some are carried by the wind , sometimes-hundreds of miles , across state and national-borders . in the united states , about 67 percent of annual so2 emissions and 25 percent of nox-emissions are produced by electric-utility-plants that burn fossil-fuels . although we have made progress as a result of the 1990-acid-rain program , we have not fully addressed the problem . indicators of recovery of lakes and streams do not show consistent-change in response to reduced so2 emissions . in sensitive-areas such as the adirondacks , for example , the majority of lakes have remained fairly-constant in terms of acidification-levels , while the most sensitive-lakes continue to acidify . overall , acid-deposition continues to impair the water-quality of lakes and streams in the northeast : 41 percent of lakes in the adirondack region of new york and 15 percent of lakes in new england exhibit-signs of chronic and/or episodic-acidification . although sulfur-deposition has declined , nitrogen-emissions have not changed substantially region-wide . moreover , recent-findings also suggest that nitrogen is quantitatively as important or , in some areas , possibly more important than sulfur as a cause of episodic-acidification because of short-term-acidic-pulses occurring during the most biologically sensitive-time of the year , when fish-reproduce . reductions of nox , particularly during winter and spring , are critical for addressing these concerns . � nitrogen-deposition : the president 's energy plan will improve eco-systems and water-bodies by reducing nox-emissions . some air-emissions of nox from power-generation-result in deposition of nitrogen in soils and water . while nitrogen is an essential-nutrient , its availability is naturally limited , making it an important-factor in regulating the structure and functioning of both terrestrial and aquatic ecological-systems . human-activity has greatly altered the terrestrial and atmospheric-nitrogen-cycle , doubling the annual-amount of nitrogen available in forms that are useful to living organisms . nitrogen-saturation of watersheds contributes to environmental-problems such as reduced drinking water-quality , nitrateinduced toxic-effects on freshwater-organisms , increased soil-acidification and aluminum-mobility , increased-emissions from soil of nitrogenous-greenhouse trace-gases , reduction of methane consumption in soil , and forest-decline and reduced productivity . coastal water and marine-environment are also impacted by atmospheric-deposition of nitrogen . depending upon the location , from 10 to more than 40 percent of new nitrogen-inputs to coastal-waters along the east coast and gulf coast of the united states come from air-pollution . one of the best documented and understood impacts of increased nitrogen is the eutrophication of estuaries and coastal-waters . eutrophication refers to the increase in the rate of supply of organic-matter to an ecosystem and its many undesirable-consequences . symptoms of eutrophication are found in many of our nation 's coastal-ecosystems . they include algal-blooms that are potentially-hazardous to human-health , low dissolved oxygen-concentrations , declines in the health of fish and shellfish populations , loss of seagrass-beds and coral-reefs , and ecological-changes in food-webs . summary of health and environmental-effects adopting a unified-approach to reduce so2 , nox and mercury is better than looking at each pollutant separately because of synergistic-effects . beyond their impacts as separate-emissions , so2 , nox , and mercury together contribute to many air pollution-related-problems affecting human-health and the environment . in certain-cases , synergies exist between emissions and among the various-reduction approaches available , making it imperative that efforts to reduce risk address all three emissions accommodate these synergies . in the case of fine-particles , atmospheric-chemical-relationships suggest that when only reducing sulfate for example , it is replaced in the atmosphere by nitrate . thus , simultaneous-nox and so2 emission-reductions are critical . in the case of acid-rain , significant-reductions in sulfur-dioxide have not corresponded to ecological-changes due to continuing high levels of nitrogen . continuing levels of sulfur-deposition , albeit smaller than before , also work to prevent recovery due to extremely large-sulfur-loadings over the years . both emissions count in achieving the goal of recovery . additionally , some synergies have been observed between methylmercury and lake-acidity - the more acidic , the greater the mercury-concentration . as more environmental-data become available and science improves , we are observing some environmental-improvement accompanying the downward-trend in emissions . however , there are persistent and growing-concerns regarding-recovery of ecosystems and the risks that air-pollution pose to human-health . for instance , nitrate-levels in surface-waters are not significantly improving , and at best are constant . logically , if emissions continue at the same level , or increase , pollution-problems will mirror that trend . visibility-impairment in national-parks , wilderness-areas and urban-areas also continues to be a problem . many people continue to be exposed to unacceptable-levels of smog . of particular-significance -- the american-public has become acutely-aware of the hazards to their health , including the risk of mortality , posed by inhalation of fine-particles and exposure to mercury through fish-consumption . iv climate-change the president 's energy plan , and the climate-change-strategy that is under development , will provide benefits by addressing-climate-change . energy-related-activities are the primary-source of u.s. man-made greenhouse-gas emissions . power-generators , which emit co2 , contribute abut 29 % of the total-emissions of all u.s. man-made-greenhouse-gases . scientists continue to learn more about global-climate-change , its causes , potential-impacts , and possible solution . we recently held cabinet-level working-group-meetings to review the most recent , most accurate and most comprehensive science . during those meetings , we heard from scientists offering a wide-spectrum of views . we have reviewed the facts and listened to many theories and suppositions . the working-group asked the highly respected national academy of sciences to provide us the most up-to-date information about what is known and about what is not known on the science of climate-change . we know the surface-temperature of the earth is warming . it has risen by .6 degrees celsius over the past 100 years . there was a warming-trend from the 1890s to the 1940s , cooling from the 1940s to the 1970s , and then sharply rising-temperatures from the 1970s to today . there is a natural-greenhouse-effect that contributes to warming . greenhouse gases trap heat and thus warm the earth because they prevent a significant portion of infrared-radiation from escaping into space . concentration of greenhouse gases , especially co2 , have increased substantially since the beginning of the industrial-revolution . and the national academy of sciences indicates that the increase is due in large part to human-activity . the academy 's report also tells us that there are many unanswered-questions about climate-change , which makes it difficult to determine what levels of greenhouse-gas emissions need to be avoided . to address global-climate-change and greenhouse-gas emissions , we are pursuing a broad-array of conservation and energy efficiency goals under the administration 's national-energy-policy as well as the development of a comprehensive-policy under the ongoing cabinet-level-review for this issue . on june 11 , president bush announced the establishment of two major-initiatives to address the major scientific and technological-challenges presented by this serious , long-term-issue : the u.s . climate research initiative and the national climate-change technology initiative . in addition , he committed the united states to increasing cooperative-efforts in the western hemisphere , and with our allies globally , to aggressively pursue joint-research and actions . these efforts have recently borne fruit , particularly recent-agreements with japan and italy to collaborate on climate-modeling-efforts and with el salvador in a `` forest for debt '' swap that will preserve tropical forests there that sequester-carbon . the complex-challenge of global-climate-change requires a global-response that will draw on the power of global markets and the promise of technology to achieve emissions-reductions most flexibly and costeffectively in the coming-century . the administration intends to address this challenge in that context , and will leverage our national-resources to enhance our scientific-understanding of global-climate-change , and develop the advanced-energy-technologies that the world will need in coming-decades to meet its energy and environmental-needs . v. conclusion our country has made great-progress in reducing-air-pollution over the last-several decades , but pollution from power-generation needs to be further controlled . we can draw no other conclusion given the significant-contribution that power-generation makes to the emissions that cause such serious public health and environmental-problems . but our current regulatory-programs are not the most efficient way to achieve the goal of ensuring a reliable-energy-supply in an environmentally responsible-manner . rather than take a pollutant-by-pollutant , problem-by-problem-approach , we have the opportunity to examine the sector as a whole . doing so provides us with the opportunity for cost-effective-reductions and significant public health and environmental-gains . that is why this administration supports the development of new legislation that builds on the success of the market-based acid-rain-program to reduce significantly the so2 , nox and mercury-emissions from power-generation . mandatory controls are not the only way to solve public health and environmental-problems . president bush 's national-energy plan also includes measures to increase conservation of energy , increase energy efficiency , and encourage technological-advances such as clean-coal-technology , fuel-cells , and combined heat and power-facilities -- all of which will contribute to addressing the energy and environmental-challenges of 11 this industry . i have already spent-time with representatives of the power-generation-sector and have heard from a number of them who are interested in legislation that will provide the public health and environmental-benefits we discussed-today . i applaud their concern and their willingness to help craft a workable-solution . i have also heard from environmentalists who are interested in these same issues . i know that many of you are interested in addressing these issues through legislation . i hope that our common-interests will lead us to a consensus - one that will provide the country with significant-benefits . i look forward to working with you on these issues . 12
