associated press justice requests filing-surcharge to fund legal-aid for poor wednesday , january 15 , 2003 olympia ( ap ) - the washington supreme court is asking the legislature to approve a $ 90 surcharge on a court-filing-fee to help provide legal-help for the poor in civil-cases , chief-justice gerry alexander said wednesday . `` some might say , why should we support this when we face tough financial-times ? '' alexander asked in his state of the judiciary address to a joint-session of the legislature . `` it seems to me in america , where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law , we should not ration access to justice . '' the recommendation comes from the court 's task-force on civil equal-justice funding , created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse-amount of money available for such cases . as the task-force was studying the issue , $ 900,000 was cut from state-support for civil equal-justice-services . that prompted the state 's two main legal-services-providers - columbia legal-services and northwest justice project - to cut their staffs , alexander said . the change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in superior court to $ 200 . the total-fee would be split , with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal-justice-account . alexander also requested-money for five additional superior court judgeships and one additional district-court judgeships , arguing that increased caseloads require more judges . two of the superior court judges and the district-court judge would be in clark county , with one superior court judge added in the joint district that serves benton and franklin counties and one each in kittitas and kitsap-counties .
