office of the general counsel b-275070 october 24 , 1996 the honorable nancy landon kassebaum chairman the honorable edward m. kennedy ranking minority member committee on labor and human-resources united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : department of health and human-services , food and drug administration : medical-devices ; current good-manufacturing practice ( cgmp ) final-rule ; quality-system-regulation pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by department of health and human-services , food and drug administration , entitled '' medical-devices ; current good-manufacturing practice ( cgmp ) final-rule ; quality-system-regulation '' ( rin : 0910-aa09 ) . we received the rule on october , 11 , 1996 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on october 7 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 52601 . the final-rule revises existing current good-manufacturing practice-requirements for medical-devices and incorporates them into a quality-system-regulation . the quality-system-regulation includes requirements related to the methods used in , and the facilities and controls used for , designing , manufacturing , packaging , labeling , storing , installing and servicing of medical-devices intended for human-use . the rule adds preproduction-design-controls and is intended to achieve consistency with quality-system requirements-worldwide . gao/ogc-97-3 enclosed is our assessment of the food and drug administration's compliance with the procedural-steps required by sections 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the food and drug administration complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact james vickers , senior-attorney , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the department of health and human-services , food and drug administration is thomas e. slomba , assistant director . mr. slomba can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-9910 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : the honorable donna e. shalala the secretary of health and human-services page 2 gao/ogc-97-3 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . §§ 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the department of health and human-services , food and drug administration entitled `` medical-devices ; current good-manufacturing practice ( cgmp ) final-rule ; quality-system-regulation '' ( rin : 0910-aa09 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the food and drug administration ( fda ) performed a cost and benefit-analysis evaluating the economic-impact of the final-rule . the estimated-total annual incremental-cost to the industry is $ 81.9 million . the majority of the costs ( $ 57.5 million ) represent the establishment of design-controls for new products . most of the remaining-costs are attributable to extending the quality-system and requiring appropriate-documentation , evaluating-suppliers and contractors and management-review . the benefits to the public health are estimated to be 36 to 44 fewer deaths per year and 484 to 677 fewer serious-injuries per year attributable to design-related-device-failures . fda assumed an economic-value of $ 5 million per fatality avoided , so that the monetary-savings per year would be $ 180 to $ 220 million per year . these figures do not include any monetary-savings associated with the reduction in serious-injuries . additionally , the fda states that the rule will result in fewer product recalls and better product-quality . finally , since the final-rule is designed to harmonize with the international-standards , device-manufacturers will not have to maintain two different-quality-systems to compete both nationally and internationally . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 the fda has concluded that the rule will have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities because almost all medical-device-establishments are classified as small under the small business-administration 's definition of size . an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis and a final regulatory-flexibility-analysis have been prepared and included in the preambles to the proposed-rule and the final-rule-notice , respectively , as required by sections 603 and 604 . the analyses comply with the informational-requirements of the sections gao/ogc-97-3 including the classes of small-entities-subject to the rule and alternatives considered to reduce the burden on the small-entities . the fda , in drafting the rule to ease the burden on small-entities , has not applied the design-requirements to all class i devices and component-suppliers have been removed from the rule's coverage . also , the requirement for traceability of components has been limited to where the agency believes it is necessary to protect the public health . in addition , other revisions were made to make the final-rule less prescriptive and to allow establishments greater flexibility in meeting the requirements . finally , the fda will conduct workshops , issue-guidance-manuals and videotapes , and hold teleconferences to aid small-entities in complying with the rule . the analyses use both quantifiable and general-descriptions of the effects of the rule on small-entities as required by section 607 and numerous small-entities participated in the rulemaking as required by section 609 by submitting-comments on the proposed-rule and by attending an open public-meeting in august 1995 and the september 1995 meeting of the good-manufacturing practice advisory-committee . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 the fda examined the final-rule as prescribed by the act and found that no mandate will be imposed on state , local or tribal-governments and it believes that the burden on the private sector will be below the $ 100 million annual-expenditure-level to require compliance with the act . however , while the cost estimated by the fda on the private sector is $ 81.9 million , in view of the uncertainties in the estimates , fda has followed the requirements of the act . as required by section 205 , fda considered regulatory-alternatives to the requirements of the rule but determined that the provisions of the final-rule constituted the most cost-effective and least burdensome-alternative that would meet the objective of the rule . to ease the regulatory-burden , the fda has extended the effective-date of the rule to june 1 , 1997 , and will not take regulatory-action for an additional-year on the design-control requirement . also , fda exempted almost all class i devices . however , fda rejected-suggestions that low-risk-devices be exempted because the cost of implementation will exceed the public-health-benefits gained . fda found that all class ii and iii devices , even those devices from firms with excellent past-records , should be covered because their failure could adversely affect public health . page 2 gao/ogc-97-3 ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule was promulgated using the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 and the procedures contained at 21 u.s.c . § 360j ( f ) ( 3 ) concerning the establishment of an advisory-committee to advise and submit recommendations to the secretary regarding regulations concerning good-manufacturing-practices . meetings of the device good-manufacturing

preamble to the final-rule discusses the comments which were received and the changes which were made to the rule based on such comments . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the final-rule contains information-collections that are subject to review by the office of management and budget and include device master-records , device-history-records , quality-system-records and complaint-files . the fda solicited-comments on these requirements in the notice of proposed-rulemaking and has evaluated and responded to them in the preamble to the final-rule . the preamble to the final-rule contains an explanation of the need for the information and the burden-estimates relating to each section of the rule . the information-collections associated with the final-rule contain 3,527,901 burden-hours which include 1,433,579 burden-hours for a one time start up expenditure for 7,237 manufacturers and 2,094,321 burden-hours expended annually by 7,237 manufacturers . the fda solicits comments on the information-collections contained in the final-rule until december 6 , 1996 , regarding the necessity of the collection , the estimate of the burden-hours and ways to minimize the burden including electronic-submission of responses . after receipt of these comments , fda will publish a notice in the federal register when the agency is submitting the collections to omb for approval and again when omb makes a decision on approval , modification or disapproval . the information-collections in the rule will not become effective until omb-approval is obtained and an omb control-number has been issued . page 3 gao/ogc-97-3 statutory-authorization for the rule the safe medical-devices act of 1990 ( pub . l. 101-629 , november 28 , 1990 ) , amended section 520 ( f ) of the federal food , drug and cosmetic act providing the fda with the authority to add preproduction-design-controls to the current good-manufacturing-practices regulation . 21 u.s.c.§ 360j ( f ) ( 1 ) ( a ) . executive-order no . 12866 the rule was determined to be an `` economically-significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order no . 12866 requiring-review by the office of management and budget , office of information and regulatory affairs ( oira ) . oira approved the final-rule as complying with the requirements of the order based on information supplied by the fda , including a planned regulatory-action-document describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary-impact of the rule . executive-order no . 12875 ( intergovernmental-partnership ) the fda has reviewed the rule under executive-order no . 12875 and finds that the order does not apply because the rule is not applicable to government-facilities but to finished device-manufacturers . however , regarding-consultation with state , local and tribal-governments , the fda notes that there were two state government-representatives who were members of the good-manufacturing-practices advisory-committee in 1995 which explored the need to revise the current good-manufacturing-practices regulation . page 4 gao/ogc-97-3
