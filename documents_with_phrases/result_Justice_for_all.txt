justice for all is a never-ending-quest documentary-shows how legal-services aids people who have nowhere else to turn by rudy larini thursday , january 23 , 2003 after becoming disabled in a machete-attack on a visit to his native haiti , jean-claude joseph needed-help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor-apartment to one on the ground-floor . isaac benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic-snafu that took away his social-security disability-payments for more than two years . the story of martha , a woman from sierra leone , was more compelling . beaten , raped and tortured in her politically repressive-homeland , she knowingly used-someone else 's passport to escape to america , but was caught by immigration-authorities upon her arrival . she desperately sought political-asylum . not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking-upheavals in the law , but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn . the work of attorneys from legal-services of new jersey will be highlighted in a onehour-documentary , `` quest for justice , '' to be aired 9 p.m. today on new jersey network . produced by nyd2 , a communications-firm based in somerset , the documentary features case-histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation . joseph , a 54-year-old naturalized-citizen , turned to legal-services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment-complex in elizabeth turned a deaf-ear to his request for a ground-floor-apartment . having lost the use of his left-arm in warding off the machete-attack during a robbery-attempt , joseph said he found it increasingly-difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging-groceries or laundry on the frequent-occasions when the building 's elevator was out of order . `` with this , it became impossible for me to stay upstairs , '' he said , pointing to the scars on his forearm . `` if i can not carry my groceries or my laundry , how can i live ? '' `` it was a compelling-case , '' said legal-services-attorney stephen st. hilaire . `` the key for us -- and we have to make tough-decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth-floor , struggling with a bag of groceries , '' he said . benjamin , 53 , of jersey city had been collecting social-security disability after undergoing double-bypass-surgery when the checks stopped coming . he said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health . `` but what got me was they did n't let me know they did n't get it , they just cut me off , '' he said , adding he found it impossible to negotiate the social-security bureaucracy himself . `` when i would call them up or go up there , they would give me blank-stares , '' he said . `` i did n't know what to do . '' so he contacted legal-services and his case was assigned to paralegal david morris . `` isaac 's case was one of government-screw-ups , '' morris said , recounting how social-security shuffled his file from new jersey to baltimore and then philadelphia before finally tracking it down . legal-services eventually got benjamin 's benefits restored . martha , who does not want her last-name used , believes she owes her very life to legal-services and lawyer laura adjangba , who won her political-asylum in the united states . `` this is a great-thing she has done for me in this world , '' she said as tears welled up in her eyes . `` god just brought her to take care of my problem . '' in new jersey , legal-services has represented more than 1.3 million clients since the program was conceived during president lyndon johnson 's war on poverty in the mid1960s . in a survey last year , legal-services determined that more than one-third of new jersey 's poor-adults -- more than 400,000 people -- have at least one civil legal-problem a year . there are legal-services-offices in every county except salem and they handle roughly 50,000 cases a year . new jersey has a legal-services budget of almost $ 38 million and a staff of 500 , including about 200 attorneys . the lawyers , many of whom could be earning considerably more in the private sector , are uniformly devoted to the principle of providing legal-assistance to those who otherwise might be denied their day in court . `` people often say , 'oh , you work with legal-services because you could n't work for a big-firm with 300 people , ' '' attorney-grayce wiggins explains on the documentary . `` people that work at legal-services are committed to the mission of legal-services . this is more than just a job . this is about changing-people 's lives . '' `` with this group , you hear them regularly say to a person they are honored to practice this kind of law , '' said michael defabrizio , an nyd2 vice-president and the executive-producer of the documentary . in the opening-segment of the documentary , nicholas deb . katzenbach , who was u.s. attorney-general under johnson , scoffs at the notion that legal-services is just another government handout . `` i think many people think of legal-services as something charitable , '' he said . `` the purpose of legal-services is not to give something to the poor other than the justice that every person is entitled to . '' does defabrizio believe his documentary will help convince people of the need for the kind of help offered by legal-services ? `` you hope that the public cares , '' he said . `` civilization really depends on human-beings caring about other human-beings .
