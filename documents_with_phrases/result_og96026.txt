it published a summary of that analysis in the preamble to the proposed-rule in the federal register on october 20 , 1993 . 58 fed . reg . 54212 . the analysis concluded that the economic-burden for initial-compliance would be minimal for about 90 percent of the small businesses affected . for the remaining 10 percent , however , the analysis stated that the program would impose a significant adverse-effect in the first year . based on the information presented during public-hearings and in comments received on the proposed-rule , epa published a supplemental-notice of proposed-rulemaking in the federal register on march 13 , 1995 . 60 fed . reg . 13526 . the agency included in the preamble to the revised proposed-rule a summary of its updated regulatory-flexibility-analysis . the analysis concluded that the rule as proposed in 1993 would have had severe adverse-effects on small businesses . the revised analysis evaluates three alternatives to the initially proposed-rule and assesses the burdens and impacts of each . according to the epa 's discussion , the streamlined requirements of the revised proposed-rule drastically reduce the burden on both small businesses and small-communities . section 604 : final regulatory-flexibility-analysis epa published a summary of its final regulatory-flexibility-analyses as required by section 604 of the act in the federal register on june 20 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 31715 . epa estimated that the total number of small-entities affected by the rule was 12,500 or 19 percent of the affected-universe . no detailed analysis of the impact on small-entities was performed because of the relatively-low-cost of implementation estimated by epa ( for most manufacturers substantially less than 1 percent of sales the first year and considerably less in subsequent-years ; for non-manufacturers less than $ 1,000 for initial-compliance ) . according to epa 's analysis , a number of decisions adopted in the final-rule ( specifically , the adoption of tiers ( `` programs '' ) , the reduced-requirements for the risk-management-plan and the development of guidance for offsite-consequence-analysis ) have significantly reduced the burden on small-entities . epa considered comments on both the initial and the proposed-rule in making these decisions . all analyses prepared in accordance with this act were submitted to the chief-counsel , small business-administration . page 2 gao/ogc-96-26 section 607 : preparation of analysis epa 's analyses use both quantifiable and general-descriptions of the effects of the rule and alternatives on small-entities . section 609 : participation by small-entities epa included small-entities ( from both government and business ) in focus-groups , public-hearings , seminars , and meetings to develop this rule . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 epa has determined that this rule contains a federal-mandate that may result in expenditures of $ 100 million or more for state , local , and tribal-governments , or the private sector in only its first year . in compliance with section 202 of the unfunded-mandates reform act , epa prepared a written-statement , including a cost-benefit-analysis , assessing the impact of the rule , which it published with both the proposed and the final-rule . as discussed previously , epa considered the future-compliance-costs in assessing the impact of the rule . consistent with the intergovernmental-provisions of sections 203 and 204 of the act , and executive-order 12875 `` enhancing the intergovernmental-partnership , '' epa involved-state , local , and business-representatives in focus-groups , public-hearings , seminars , and meetings to develop the rule . section 205 of the act requires agencies to identify and consider a reasonable-number of regulatory-alternatives and to adopt the least costly , most cost-effective or least burdensome-alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule . the preamble to the final-rule indicates that epa evaluated three different-methodologies for implementation . it ultimately chose what it believed to be the least costly and least burdensome-alternative . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . this rule was promulgated through the general-notice of proposed-rulemaking procedures of the act , 5 u.s.c . § 553 . epa afforded interested-persons several-opportunities to comment . following-publication of the proposed-rule ( 58 fed . reg . 54190 ) , epa held four public-hearings and received approximately 770 written comments . because of these comments , epa issued a supplemental-notice of proposed-rulemaking on march 13 , 1995 ( 60 fr 13526 ) for comment on : page 3 gao/ogc-96-26 approaches for setting different-requirements for sources that pose different-levels of hazard ( tiering ) ; worst-case-releases and other hazard-assessment-issues ; accident-information-reporting ; public-participation ; inherently safer approaches ; and implementation and integration of section 112 ( r ) with state-programs , particularly-state-air permitting-programs . epa held a public-hearing on march 31 , 1995 , in washington , dc , and received more than 283 written comments . in total , commenters represented 92 chemical-manufacturers , 81 other chemical-users , 111 petroleum industry-companies , 174 industry trade-associations , 40 other trade-associations , 58 agricultural-supply-retailers , 102 propane retailers , 132-explosives-users , 29 water-treatment facilities , 26 utilities , 66-state-agencies , 63 local governments , 8 other federal-agencies , 52 academics and consultants , 61 environmental-groups , 6 labor-unions , and 31 private-citizens . this rule reflects epa's consideration of all comments ; major-issues raised by commenters and epa 's response are briefly discussed in the preamble . a summary of all comments submitted and epa 's response to them is available at the agency . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule imposes information-collection-requirements in the registration-process , in the preparation and submission of the risk-management-plans , and in the maintenance of on-site-documentation . epa describes in the preamble to the rule the reasons for the collection of information , the type of information and an estimate of the burden imposed on the source . both initial and supplemental proposed-rule publications invited-comments on the information-collection-requirements imposed by the rule . 58 fed . reg . 53212 . 60 fed . reg . 13543 . section 3506 ( c ) of the act requires each agency to establish an independent-process to review each proposed collection of information before submitting the proposal to omb for review . epa's office of program planning and evaluation conducted such a review . epa subsequently sent the information-collection-requirements to the office of management and budget for approval under the act . 44 u.s.c . §§ 3507 ( a ) ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . epa 's discussion of its compliance with the paperwork reduction act was omitted from the final-rule , including the agency 's response to comments by oira required to be discussed in the final-rule by 44 u.s.c . § 3507 ( d ) ( 2 ) . consequently , there is no evidence in epa 's filing of oira's comments on , approval or disapproval of , the agency 's information-collection-requirements . epa did , however , reduce the potential burden of required-information collection in drafting the final-rule . see discussion below . epa appears to meet the omb requirement ( 5 c.f.r . § 1320.8 ( a ) ( 5 ) ) that agencies evaluate the use of automated , electronic or other technological-collection-forms by allowing-sources to register and file risk-management-plans electronically , thus avoiding what could have been a huge-paperwork-burden . page 4 gao/ogc-96-26 executive-order no . 12866 based on its economic-impact , the rule was determined to be an '' economically-significant regulatory-action '' within the meaning of executive-order 12866 . epa submitted both the proposed-rule and the final-rule to the office of information and regulatory affairs ( oira ) for review . according to epa , oira raised some concerns about the scope of information-collection-requirements initially proposed by epa . epa addressed oira 's concerns by lessening the information-collection-requirements for risk-management-plans in its final-rule . in the federal register notice , epa described lessening risk-management-plan information-requirements as follows : '' . . . epa has limited the requirements for information to that which can be reported as data-elements . in contrast , the rule as proposed would have required sources to document for each process all major-hazards , the consequences of each of these hazards , the risk-reduction-steps taken to address each hazard , and the consequences of each risk-reduction-step . the result would have been , for large , complex-sources , documents of a l,000 pages or more . '' statutory-authorization for the rule this rule is promulgated under sections 112 ( a ) , 301 ( a ) ( 1 ) , title v of the clean-air act as amended ( 42 u.s.c . § § 7412 ( r ) , 7601 ( a ) ( i ) , 7661-7661f ) . the intent of section 112 ( r ) is to prevent accidental-releases to the air and mitigate the consequences of such releases by focusing-prevention-measures on chemicals that pose the greatest risk to the public and the environment . section 112 ( r ) ( 3 ) mandates that epa promulgate a list of regulated substances , with threshold-quantities ; this list defines the stationary-sources that will be subject to accident-prevention regulations mandated by section 112 ( r ) ( 7 ) . epa promulgated its list of substances on january 31 , 1994 ( 59 fed . reg . 4478 ) . epa did not identify any other statute or executive-order imposing procedural-requirements relevant to this rule . supplementary-information the rule is not covered in the judicial-review-provisions recently added to the regulatory-flexibility-act by the small business regulatory enforcement act of 1996 ( pub . l. 104-121 , title ii , march 29 , 1996 ) because it was published as a final-rule before the effective-date of those provisions . it is , however , reviewable under page 5 gao/ogc-96-26 the clean-air act . see 42 u.s.c . § 7607 ( b ) ( 1 ) . under that provision , judicial-review of the requirements contained in this rule is available only by petition for review in the u.s. district of appeals for the district of columbia circuit within 60 days of publication of this final-rule . page 6 gao/ogc-96-26
