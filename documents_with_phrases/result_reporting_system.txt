the lsc matters reporting-system august 8 , 2002 introduction starting on july 1 , 2001 , all lsc grantees began collecting information on non-case-activities using the matters reporting-system . lsc had long noted that grantee-programs provide referrals and community legal-education , that they engage in outreach , and that they work cooperatively with other groups to address the needs of the low-income-community . we recognized that this work often entails a great deal of effort and produces significant-results . with the matters reporting-system in place , an important-tool has been created for use by legal-services-leaders at the national , state and local-levels in describing the full-scale and scope of legal-services being delivered in communities across the nation . although the 2001 data reported in march of this year should be regarded as preliminary ( it covered only half a year and reflected the usual-kinds of startup-problems one would expect of a new data-system ) , it already has produced a wealth of information that allows the corporation to provide a more complete-picture of legal-services-practice than has ever before been possible on a nationwide-basis . for example , we can already say that : ! the total number of people being served annually by lsc grantees is several times the number of cases being reported on the case service report ( csr ) . a conservative-estimate of just the people receiving-services that can be easily counted , such as referrals and legal-education-presentations , shows that more than two million people were provided with these services in the last six months of 2001 alone . many more were provided with other services using-delivery-vehicles whose reach is more difficult to quantify , such as web sites , weekly-radio and tv shows and legal-information columns in newspapers . ! more than 75 percent of grantees are providing various-forms of pro se assistance . these include workshops , courthouse-help desks , forms , pleadings , self-help-packets and other resources for self-representation in simple legal-matters . in addition to providing an important-service to people who can not afford lawyers , lsc grantees are playing a significant-role in helping-courts to deal with the flood of self-represented-litigants appearing in courtrooms across the nation . ! increasingly , lsc grantees are important-gatekeepers , or '' hubs , '' in referral-networks of agencies and service providers serving-low-income people . these are addressing a wide-range of needs of the poor , including-access to jobs , education , shelter and personal-safety . many lsc grantees operate intake-systems that systematically diagnose each applicant 's problems and make referrals through a network of legal and non-legal-service providers in the community who can provide the most appropriate types and levels of service . with the implementation of the matters reporting-system , the corporation has created an asset offering significant-dividends for stakeholders at all levels of the civil-justice-system . along with the csr system , which quantifies `` case '' services , the matters reporting-system provides an expanded capacity to produce numerical and narrative-data describing the full-range of services provided by the core-network of legal-services-programs serving-communities across the nation . with further refinements underway to improve reliability , this system will enable program-leaders at all levels to provide congress , client-groups , state-legislatures , bar-leaders , courts , funders and other stakeholders with a more accurate-picture of how many people are being served by lsc-funded-programs . it will help to identify innovative , best-practice-models that point the way toward more efficient and effective-methods of addressing the legal-needs of low-income-people . it will inform lsc grantees about the range of methods being used by their fellow-program-managers to deliver more and better services and to assist people with the precise-level and type of service appropriate to their legal-situation . it will enable leaders to do a better job of marketing legal-services by telling the `` story '' of what lsc grantees are contributing to their communities through the partnerships they have created and the wide-range of solutions they have put in place . in the next-section of this report , we describe in more detail the picture that emerges from the 2001 matters service reports . in addition , we outline some changes that the lsc `` results group '' ( a working-group of senior lsc professionals plus ken smith , an outside consultant , that designed , tested , and is currently evaluating and refining a system for reporting-matters-services ) is considering for improving the reliability of the data obtained for 2002 and 2003 . overview of matters-services provided by lsc grantees a . more than two million people received significant-matters-services from lsc grantees in the last-half of 2001 . this figure is conservative . it only includes the counts that the lsc results group deemed reliable based on a review of the data and follow-up-interviews with a sample of grantees . ( see exhibit 1 for a summary of `` reliable '' versus `` soft '' numbers . ) the actual-number of people provided various non-case-services by lsc-funded-programs is almost certainly-several times higher . refinements in the guidelines provided to grantees , planned for distribution in october 2002 , will provide more reliable-figures to be generated covering 2002 and 2003 services . b . `` matters '' services were of six types . 1 . community legal-education . 195 lsc grantees ( 99.5 percent ) reported providing-community legal-education-services to low-income-people in their communities . according to `` matters '' reports by grantees , in the second half of 2001 , more than 1,450,000 people received these services . among the services delivered were the following : ! presentations at gatherings of low-income-people ( for example , residents of a local senior-center ) ; ! legal-education-brochures distributed at community-centers , helping-agencies and other community-sites ; ! legal-education-videos distributed through libraries , courthouse-kiosks , public-access tv and community-sites ; ! legal-education-materials downloaded over the internet by people visiting-web-sites maintained by lsc grantees . community legal-education is a crucial-service provided by lsc grantees . it informs low-income-people about their legal-rights and responsibilities connected with various-situations they might encounter as consumers , tenants , parents , spouses , employees and citizens . it equips people to handle simple-matters themselves , reducing the strain on already-overburdened-courts and legal-assistance-programs . it is preventative , helping-people to avoid mistakes that can lead to more serious legal-problems and the need for representation in the future . 2 . pro se assistance . legal-services-programs provide a broad-range of generalized-information and assistance to people wishing to handle simple legal-matters themselves without extensive assistance from an attorney . 150 lsc grantees reported that in 2001 they provided pro se assistance-services . they indicated that in the second half of 2001 more than 183,000 people were served . the numbers of grantees providing different types of services were as follows : number of grantees ! self-help-workshops or clinics 89 ! help-desk at court 56 ! self-help-materials posted on web sites 44 ! other ( e.g. , self-help-materials posted on kiosks ) 70 3 . referrals . people come to legal-aid-offices with a wide-range of problems , some of them falling within the scope of the program's priorities and others that do not . referring-people to other organizations that can help them is a crucial-service that most legal-aid-programs provide . any referral which is not a `` case '' as defined by the csr system can be counted as a matter . examples of `` matters '' referrals would be criminal-matters or civil-problems excluded under a grantee's priorities - for example , divorces not involving domestic-violence or children . in the second half of 2001 , grantees reported providing '' matters '' referrals to 533,490 people . the table below indicates the kinds of help to which these people were referred : 4 . outreach . lsc grantees seek to increase visibility in the client-community in several-situations - for example , when launching new services ( for example , a toll-free-phone-hotline ) , trying to reach special-needs-populations ( the elderly , homeless-people , families reaching the end of their eligibility-period for welfare , people in non-english speaking-communities ) or expanding services into hard-to-serve-communities ( for example , to small towns far from legal-aid-offices ) . 89 percent of lsc grantees reported that they conducted-outreach efforts in 2001 . the method used most often ( by 61 percent of grantees ) was referral-agreements with other agencies . these are agreements made with other service providers , such as domestic-violence-shelters , to refer eligible-clients to our grantees . this is a very effective way of letting the public know we are there . other outreach-methods used were informational-notices printed in local-media ( 53 percent ) , tv spots or public-service announcements ( 32 percent ) , radio-spots or announcements ( 39 percent ) , newsletters of other organizations ( 44 percent ) , `` how to reach us '' information on web sites ( 59 percent ) and other methods ( 49 percent ) . increasingly , grantees are using targeted-outreach-methods rather than shotgun-approaches like general-media-advertising . these are designed to reach people specifically having critical legal-needs addressed by special legal-aid-projects such as domestic-violence-clinics , eviction-prevention-programs and disability-advocacy-units . an example of targeted-outreach is the posting of an advertisement for order-of-protection-clinics in domestic-violence-shelters and family-counseling-agencies . 5 . indirect-services . number of grantees 169 some legal-aid-programs tap the significant-resources of other community-organizations in an effort to expand their reach . they are doing this by providing legal-training and support to non-lawyer `` helping '' personnel such as social-workers , ministers , teachers and shelter-staff who apply this new knowledge to help their clients find appropriate legal-information and advice when they have a legal-problem . one hundred sixty nine grantees reported they used such `` indirect '' service-delivery-models in 2001 . this has a multiplier effect : one lawyer trains 20 social-workers , each of whom helps 50 clients , resulting in 1,000 people and families getting legal-information , materials or referrals they might otherwise not have had . applying this principle , legal-aid-programs are beginning to form collaborations with other agencies to provide holistic solutions for complex-problems such as domestic-violence that raise other issues such as the need for income-support , health care and child-care-services . legal-aid-lawyers and paralegals increasingly are partnering with social-workers , medical-people , job-counselors and other specialists to provide the right-mix of legal and non-legal-services-people need to get back on their feet . 6 . other services . in addition to the above , there are a number of newer kinds of services that grantees reported as `` matters '' in 2001 . these include the following : number of grantees ! mediation / alternative-dispute-resolution 38 ! other 58 in the last six months of 2001 lsc-programs reported providing such `` other `` matters-services to over 49,000 people c. significance : `` matters '' services have major-impacts on our communities , courts and low-income-population . ! community legal-education prevents small-problems from getting worse and reduces the strain on our legal-system . ! pro se assistance empowers people to help themselves and makes our court-system work better . ! referrals help people find the help they need . it is clear from the matters service reports that lsc grantees have dramatically expanded the range of strategies available for addressing the legal-needs of low-income-people . the data-collection system provides lsc with the capacity to track the expansion of these methods and to better describe their scale and impacts as this expansion continues . the matters data includes some people who were not eligible-clients . it is impractical to restrict grantees to counting only matters handled on behalf of client-eligible-people . however , we believe that the number is a small-proportion of the total . lsc grantees go to considerable-lengths to focus services on the client-eligible-population . in the first instance , this is done by presenting the services as being for the poor , including the targeting of outreach-efforts on groups and areas in which poor-people congregate and live . the subject-matter of written materials and of events ( for example , legal-education-workshops is on issues of particular-concern to our clients ) . the sponsorship and location of events and location of grantee-offices contributes to this targeting . and where ineligible-persons participate anyway , the great-majority of them are near-poor , often those who are eligible under non-lsc-funding-programs such as iolta and administration on aging . even with web-based-services , which are notoriously-difficult to target exclusively to a particular-segment , there is some evidence that the majority of users are client-eligible-people . for example , web visitor survey-data from pinetree legal-services in maine indicates that two-thirds of its site-visitors are low-income-people or persons seeking-information on behalf of low-income-people . implementation of the system : a status-report planning for the matters service reports process was several months in the making . in designing the instrument , consultant ken smith and the lsc results group examined existing-data-collection models that state iolta funders and individual-programs had used . the group then drafted an instrument and pilot tested it with a volunteer-group of 22 programs in january 2001 . their experience led to the version that was implemented in all lsc grantee-programs in july , 2001 . what 's working , what issues need to be addressed . the general-concept of matters is working well . the data-system seems to have been well accepted by field-programs ; the system includes a narrative-component as well as statistical-reporting , providing the corporation with a strong-capacity for describing the character as well as the volume of services and delivery-models in use . the 2001 reports have enabled the lsc results group to identify adjustments for improving-reliability of the numerical-data being provided by grantees . these include ! clarification of definitions . for example , `` web-hits '' were counted in the 2001 version of the system , but this proved to be a vague-concept that produced huge-numbers but little-useable information . definitions will be clarified for measures to be used in 2003 for quantifying the reach of web-based legal-education and pro se assistance-models . ! additional-questions . considering the difficulty of changing data-collection-systems in mid-stream , few changes are being considered that would require grantees to revise their forms or procedures . however , in a few areas , small-changes will be proposed that are relatively-easy to implement . for example , in 2002 grantees will be asked to report the number of newspaper-articles published rather than the number of people reached by newspaper-articles , which is nearly-impossible to quantify in a useful way . ! improved-guidelines . for example , more guidance will be provided to grantees on quantifying the numbers of brochures and materials-packets they have distributed . clearer distinctions will be drawn between newsletter-articles , which are targeted to well-defined-audiences , and newspaper-articles , which are broadcast to the general-population . additional-guidelines will be provided for estimating-numbers that can not be directly counted . these changes are expected to lead to greater reliability in the matters data for 2002 and 2003 . some of the figures which grantees estimated in 2001 will be measured in 2002 as data-collection-systems become better established and guidelines get wider distribution to program-staff . figures which the results group deemed too `` soft '' to be used in 2001 will eventually be moved to the `` reliable '' column . conclusion the data from the matters reporting-system can be used for a variety of important-purposes . these include : ! producing-materials that provide congress , bar-leaders and other stakeholders with a more accurate-picture of how many people are being served by lsc-funded-programs . ! describing the benefits that services such as community legal-education , pro se assistance and referrals to community-agencies provide to the communities served by lsc grantees . ! identifying-programs that have developed innovative , best-practice-models , pointing the way toward more efficient and effective-methods of addressing the legal-needs of low-income-people . ! informing-grantees about the range of methods being used by their fellow-program-managers to deliver more and better services and to reach more people with the precise-level and type of service appropriate to their legal-situation . ! doing a better job of marketing legal-services by telling the '' story '' of what lsc grantees are contributing to their communities through the partnerships they have created and the wide-range of solutions they have put in place . the matters reporting-system represents an important-asset now in place in lsc-funded-programs . it will provide a stream of information about legal-services-practice serving the civil-justice-community well into the future .
