report : farm-workers plagued by pesticides legal-aid-group alleges laws violated coleman cornelius the farm-workers said they knew they had breathed poison-moments after a crop-duster buzzed nearby , spraying a field of sweet-corn with pesticides to kill mites and worms . most of the 20 migrant-farm-workers , in an adjacent-lettuce field in olathe , said they felt sick immediately : they gasped for breath , had pounding-headaches , irritated-eyes and swollen , numb tongues . some vomited as a cloud of white-chemicals settled on fields around them . the farm-workers in the western colorado community said they left the lettuce-field when sprayed , but a foreman ordered them to continue working , saying the crop-duster had released a harmless solution of soap and water . a new study by colorado legal-services , the first of its kind in the rocky mountain region , says such migrant-workers at farms statewide are regularly exposed to hazardous-pesticides in violation of federal-laws . the company that hired the workers for the olathe-farm and the farmer whose land they were working have denied any role in making the workers sick . the lettuce-workers , talking about their incident last week , said their experience illustrates the problems . 'we were cutting-lettuce , and we saw the plane coming . it was spraying , and the wind was blowing , so it blew toward us , ' said blanca chavez , 44 , who sought-shelter in a portable-toilet . 'we ingested it . it was like a fog . ' another farm-worker , 22-year-old marcelina lopez , was five months pregnant during the reported olathe spraying-incident on june 29 . she developed-stomach-cramps and a rash on her belly and arms , lopez said as she and six others on the lettuce-crew discussed the incident last week . lopez saw a doctor three days after the spraying , but that heightened her concern . 'the doctor could n't tell if the baby was affected , ' her husband said in spanish . 'we worry a lot because we do n't know if the baby will be affected . ' jim dorsey , an officer of cactus produce - the scottsdale , ariz. , farm-labor-contractor that employs the crew - said company policy requires that incidents of pesticide-exposure be reported immediately . he said crew-supervisors did not report what workers described . lacking-field or physician-reports , he questioned whether the incident occurred . grower tom humphrey also was skeptical . 'i think this is a crock , ' said humphrey , a vegetable-farmer for 30 years . 'you 're listening to somebody who wants money for nothing . ' nevertheless , chavez took her case to colorado legal-services , a nonprofit-law-firm that represents low-income-clients in civil-cases around the state . she and the other farm-workers said they agreed to publicly discuss the olathe-incident to illustrate the hazards-laborers face in the fields and to push growers to abide by pesticide-safety-laws . chavez 's case mirrors the findings of the survey by colorado legal-services , which reports that migrant-workers at farms statewide are regularly exposed to hazardous-pesticides in violation of federal-laws . the exposure comes from chemical-residue on plants in farm fields and from pesticide-drift , such as the incidents-lettuce workers described , according to the survey . legal-services conducted-interviews with 88-farm-workers in some of colorado 's most abundant agricultural-regions last year and found that half of those surveyed had experienced symptoms of pesticide-exposure . the symptoms included-skin-rash , inflamed-eyes , headaches and irritation of the nose and throat . those surveyed worked in weld county , the arkansas valley , the san luis valley and the western slope and took part in 30-minute interviews at farm-labor-housing in those regions . kimi jackson , author of the colorado legal-services study , said the surveys were detailed and the responses consistent across the state . 'it 's striking that so many farm-workers report experiencing symptoms of pesticide-exposure , ' said jackson , director of the agency 's pesticide-project . 'imagine in your own office if half the workers had experienced symptoms like that . that 's very high . ' ray christensen , executive-vice-president of the colorado farm bureau , said growers on the state 's 20,000 farms consider pesticide safety important for themselves and their employees , in part because they want to maintain a productive-workforce and avoid liability . 'pesticides can be very injurious if they are not handled properly . i think farmers across the united states realize that , ' christensen said . yet the legal-services report faults-growers , farm-labor-contractors and crop-dusters for routinely failing to abide by federal-regulations meant to protect worker-health . the study also demands that the u.s. environmental-protection agency and colorado department of agriculture better enforce the 10- year-old-laws , collectively called the worker protection standard . the laws require that farm-workers be prevented from entering fields treated with pesticides until recommended times have elapsed . the laws also mandate that workers be trained in pesticide safety , are notified of fields that have been sprayed , have fresh water to wash chemicals from their skin and receive emergency medical-help in cases of pesticide-exposure or illness . epa records show employers regularly fail to follow the rules . last year , the agency 's regional-office inspected 23 colorado farms , and 20 failed to fully comply with federal-laws meant to protect farm-workers from pesticides , said tim osag , an enforcement coordinator . those farms got warning-letters and will be inspected again , he said . 'workers were not being trained . there was no central-location where the required-information was being posted , and several of them did not have decontamination-supplies , ' said britta campbell , an epa enforcement-officer who conducted most of the farm inspections . 'obviously we have a regulation which is not being followed , ' osag said . 'there is a potential that we 're exposing-workers to increased health-risks . ' migrant-farm-workers - 16,000 to 40,000 in colorado , according to the u.s. department of labor - are critical to the state 's $ 1.23 billion-agriculture-industry . they travel from farm to farm , tending and harvesting-fruits and vegetables . farm-workers earn an average of $ 5.15 an hour for jobs that often require fieldwork from sunup to sundown during the growing season , jackson said . many migrant-farm-workers are reluctant to report pesticide problems because they fear they will lose their jobs , laborers said . 'we do the work in the fields because we do n't have a lot of education , and in this country you need to have an education to have a good job . we do n't feel like we have any options , ' said maria figeroa , 54 , a member of the lettuce-crew reportedly overcome by pesticide-drift in olathe . she and other crew-members spoke in spanish through an interpreter . pesticides , widely used to increase crop-yields , have become a leading-health-concern among migrant-farm-workers . coloring-books distributed to the children of farm-workers in weld county warn youngsters to run when they see crop-dusters spraying 'pesticidas . ' in 1998 , cesar chavez fasted for 36 days in california to underscore the dangers of pesticides to farm-workers and their children . it was the last and longest fast for the 61-year-old civil-rights activist . the following year , chavez 's organization , united farm-workers , released a seminal-study addressing the health-effects of pesticides on farmworkers . the report , 'fields of poison , ' found that california farmworkers face greater risk of pesticide poisoning than any other segment of the population and are not adequately protected . like the colorado report , it called for stronger enforcement of existing-laws . little-research has been conducted on the long-term-health effects of pesticides on farm-workers . but some research-points to danger : a study published earlier this year in the american journal of industrial medicine found that migrant-farm-workers in california , most of them hispanic , have a 59 percent higher risk of developing-leukemia than other hispanics in the state . field-laborers have a 69 percent higher risk for stomach-cancer . male-workers also have a higher chance of developing-brain-cancer , while female-workers have a higher risk for uterine-cancer , according to the study , which linked the risks to pesticide-exposure . researchers compared farm-worker-data from united farm-workers with that from the california cancer registry . it is hard to prove that worker-illness is a result of pesticide-exposure in the field because other things , both on and off the job , can trigger physical-symptoms , said dr. suzanne wuerthele , an epa toxicologist in denver . yet dozens of chemicals commonly used to kill weeds , fungus and insects on agricultural-crops can cause immediate-sickness in people who inhale , swallow or absorb them through skin-contact , wuerthele said . recent-research raises questions about the connection between pesticide-exposure and long-term-health-problems , such as chronic headaches , sleep disorders , vision-problems , nerve-damage , cancer and birth-defects , wuerthele said . 'these chemicals are always-dangerous to humans . that 's why they have to be used correctly , ' she said . 'they are designed to kill things , and they can be toxic to humans . ' chavez said she called colorado legal-services because she felt sick and did not know where to turn . 'they 're not worms , ' said guierrmo othon , chavez 's husband , who is also a lettuce-worker . 'these are human-lives . '
