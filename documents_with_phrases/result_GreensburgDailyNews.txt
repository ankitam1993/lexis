greensburg daily news from cornfield to courtroom jim cummings november 14 , 2002 growing up on a farm near st. paul , l. mark bailey did n't dream of becoming a judge . even when he graduated from north decatur high school in 1975 , sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely-activity than a career . somewhere along the line , all of that changed . bailey received his bachelor 's degree from the university of indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence-doctorate from indiana university-indianapolis in 1982 . after several years of private-practice from 1982-90 , he became the judge of decatur county court for a year . the indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and bailey was tabbed decatur superior court judge from 1992-98 , winning-reelection twice . from there , his career continued on the fast-track and bailey was appointed by gov . frank o'bannon to sit on the indiana court of appeals first district , where he works today . despite his quick-climb up the legal-ladder , bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about . it was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized . the indiana pro-bono commission hosted its annual-celebration event , the randall t. shepard dinner , at french lick springs spa in october . more than 100 judges , lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering . one of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever randall t. shepard award for excellence in pro-bono-work . bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer-work at indiana pro-bono commission . the award was named after the chief-justice of the indiana supreme court to honor his statewide-vision on justice . the qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative-development and delivery of legal-services to the poor in one of the 14 pro-bono districts of indiana . `` this award came as a real-surprise to me . it is truly an honor . just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro-bono process was somewhat-humbling . it took a lot of hard-work by all of the committee-members to make this a reality , '' bailey said . `` it also takes a commitment by all of the state 's lawyers to make sure that every individual can have their day in court . it is on their behalf that i accepted the award . it is so important that the courts remain open to all citizens not just the rich . '' although this award will now be handed out annually , bailey was selected for several years of his commitment . in being named the original-chairman of the indiana pro-bono commission three years ago , he led the 21-member board to create a structure that would embrace shepard 's pro-bono ideals from beginning . `` judge bailey was chosen because he should be looked at as the representative of all future-winners . those recipients should strive to follow his example . he dedicated three years of his life to creating the framework of the indiana pro-bono commission as it was set up by indiana code 6.5 , '' said jennifer konomos , executive director of the indiana pro-bono commission . `` he is a joy to work with and is very professional . he 's dedicated to justice and ensuring that every individual has the ability to take their legal-issues to court regardless of their social-stature . '' to date , the ipbc has contributed more than $ 1.3 million to help provide civil legal-services to the poor . `` bailey is very patriotic and proved that by dedicating three years of his life to this cause . his mission was to make sure that no one was left behind in our legal-system . because of him lawyers are lining up every day to be part of what he created . this is just a wonderful-office to be part of , '' konomos said . the ipbc has received praise from legal-offices nationwide . when it was created , it was the first of its kind in the country . recently , the state of maryland has created a similar-program after the model created in indiana . perhaps the most glowing-comments on bailey 's philanthropy came from the man after whom the award was named . `` judge bailey has taken the lead in creating this program that helps people who can not afford a lawyer for civil-litigation . people from indiana , related to the project , are often asked to speak nationally about our system , '' shepard said . `` that is a great compliment to bailey and to indiana . many types of civil-litigation involve things that are dear to us . our homes , jobs and families can be at stake . these are important-issues dear to him . he 's a decent-self effacing-person who works hard at being a judge . we're all better off because he is in that position . '' bailey still seems to have a hard time accepting that the award was really given to him . `` these are the ideals i used when i was in private-practice . as a trial-judge i am always-happy to see equity in the courts . it is when we have competent-counsel representing both litigants , regardless of money , that the system works best . i look at it as a form of homeland-security which has become so prevalent lately , '' bailey said . `` we need to ensure that the third-branch [ the judiciary ] of the government is working for everyone . i 'm so pleased that i was recognized for my efforts , i just ca n't take all of the credit . so many people were involved in this process . i also think this looks good for decatur county . i have the highest regard for their judicial-system .
