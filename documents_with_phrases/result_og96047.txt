office of the general counsel b-274636 ; b-274637 september 23 , 1996 the honorable richard g. lugar chairman the honorable patrick j. leahy ranking minority member committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry united states senate the honorable pat roberts chairman the honorable e ( kika ) de la garza ranking minority member committee on agriculture house of representatives subject : department of agriculture , federal crop-insurance corporation : catastrophic-risk protection endorsement and general administrative-regulations ; federal crop-insurance reform act of 1994 , regulations for implementation pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on two major-rules promulgated by department of agriculture , federal crop-insurance corporation , entitled '' catastrophic-risk protection endorsement '' and `` general administrative-regulations ; federal crop-insurance reform act of 1994 , regulations for implementation '' ( rin : 0563-ab11 ) . we received the rules on september 12 , 1996 . they were published in the federal register as final-rules on august 20 , 1996 . 61 fed . reg . 42979 and 61 fed . reg . 42970 . the first listed-rule provides for a catastrophic-risk protection-plan of crop-insurance and the second rule provides noninsured-producers , policyholders , and insurance companies the regulations applicable to the catastrophic-risk protection program . this new catastrophic-risk protection level of insurance was mandated by the federal crop-insurance reform act of 1994 ( p.l . 103-354 ) . gao/ogc-96-47 enclosed is our assessment of the federal crop-insurance corporation 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by sections 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rules . our review indicates that the corporation complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact james w. vickers , senior-attorney , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the department of agriculture , federal crop-insurance corporation is robert a. robinson , director for food and agriculture issues . mr. robinson can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-5138 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : mr. kenneth ackerman manager federal crop-insurance corporation page 2 gao/ogc-96-47 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . §§ 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of two major-rules issued by the department of agriculture , federal crop-insurance corporation entitled `` catastrophic-risk protection endorsement '' ( rin : 0563-ab09 ) and `` general administrative-regulations ; federal crop-insurance reform act of 1994 , regulations for implementation '' ( rin : 0563-ab11 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis the federal crop-insurance corporation ( fcic ) prepared a cost-benefit-analysis in connection with the final-rules . the costs and benefits discussed in the analysis consider both rules . the analysis estimated $ 25 million in savings associated with requiring a producer to obtain at least catastrophic-coverage for any crop of economic-significance as a condition of receiving-benefits for that crop under certain department of agriculture programs ( linkage-requirement ) or signing a waiver for eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance . a $ 3 million cost resulting from the loss of revenue is estimated from the tobacco-marketing card and the undivided-interest-language which allows a landowner to obtain catastrophic-coverage to satisfy the linkage-requirement for all other landowners who hold an undivided interest in given insurable-acreage . therefore , a $ 22 million annual-savings is estimated to result from the rules . in addition , the rule is expected to result in less volatility of producers ' incomes and less risk of no income due to adverse weather-events and rural-communities and producers will benefit from the certainty of payments in times of catastrophic-yield losses . the government-benefits from a single-disaster-protection program , as opposed to the previous ad hoc disaster-programs , and reduced federal-outlays . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 pursuant to section 605 ( b ) of the act , fcic certified in the preambles to both the interim-rules ( 60 fed . reg . 2000 and 1996 ( january 6 , 1995 ) ) and the final-rules ( 61 fed . reg . 42980 and 42970 ( august 20 , 1996 ) ) that the rules would not have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . therefore , there was no requirement to prepare an initial or final regulatory-flexibility-analysis under sections 603 or 604 of the act . for the same reason , sections 607 and 609 are inapplicable . gao/ogc-96-47 however , the preambles to the final-rules do discuss additional-flexibility and cost-savings for small-entities in several-areas . first , producers are no longer required to obtain at least catastrophic-coverage for economically-significant crops but may sign a waiver foregoing emergency crop loss assistance . second , all producers with a share in a tobacco-crop are allowed to be under one marketing-card to insure the crop under one insurance-policy . finally , with certain-restrictions , persons who hold an undivided interest in a crop may be eligible to purchase one insurance-policy covering all shares to satisfy linkage-requirements , thereby not having to pay the $ 50-processing-fee in these situations . according to an official at fcic , publication of the certifications in the federal register was treated as providing-notice under section 605 ( b ) to the small business administration's ( sba ) chief-counsel for advocacy . the sba has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice without objection from sba . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 in the preambles to the final-rules , fcic explains that the rules do not contain a federal-mandate under title 2 of the act for state , local or tribal-governments or the private sector and therefore , sections 202 and 205 of the act are inapplicable . in addition , the final-rules do not affect small-governments or contain a significant intergovernmental-mandate . accordingly , sections 203 and 204 of the act , which require agencies to consult with small-governments and solicit input from state , local , and tribal-governments , are also inapplicable . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rules were promulgated through the notice and comment-rulemaking procedures of the act , 5 u.s.c . § 553 . because the federal crop-insurance reform act of 1994 required that the statutory-changes be implemented by the 1995-crop-year and many of the changes were mandated by the statute , fcic invoked the exception to the notice and comment-requirements contained in 5 u.s.c . § 553 ( b ) ( b ) that it would be impractical and contrary to the public-interest to publish the rules prior to making the rules effective . therefore , the rules were published as interim-rules rather than as proposed-rules . however , a 60-day-period was afforded for comments to be submitted on the interim-rules , which period was reopened on august 7 , 1995 and extended to august 18 , 1995 . forty-comments were received and considered prior to the issuance of the final-rules . each of the comments and the response and changes page 2 gao/ogc-96-47 made by the fcic based on such comments are discussed in the preambles to the final-rules . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the information-collections contained in the rules , which include the crop-insurance application and crop-insurance acreage report , were submitted to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for approval as required by the act . the submittal , which was made available to the public , contained the reasons for collecting the information and the burden-estimates , as required by the act . on march 22 , 1996 , omb approved the information-collection and assigned omb control no . 0563-003 . statutory-authorization for the rules the corporation is authorized under 5 u.s.c . §§ 1506 ( l ) and ( p ) to issue-regulations to carry out the function of providing-crop insurance . these rules implement section 106 of the federal crop-insurance reform act of 1994 ( pub . l. 103-354 ) and section 193 of the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 ( pub . l. 104-127 ) requiring the fcic to offer catastrophic-risk protection . executive-order no . 12866 the rules were determined to be `` economically-significant '' under executive-order 12866 requiring-review by the office of management and budget , office of regulatory affairs ( oira ) . oira approved the final-rules as complying with the requirements of the order based on the information supplied by fcic , including a planned regulatory-action-document describing the reasons for the rules and an assessment of the costs and budgetary-impact of the rules . other executive-orders and statutes the preambles to the final-rules-state that the rules have been reviewed under executive-orders nos . 12372 ( intergovernmental cooperation ) and 12612 ( federalism ) and found not subject to those orders . also , according to the preambles , the final-rules were reviewed pursuant to executive-order no . 12778 ( civil-justice-reform ) . however , that executive-order has been replaced by executive-order no . 12988 , effective may 5 , 1996 . the prior executive-order contained a similar-requirement now found at section 3 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of the newly effective-order requiring that the preemptive-effects of the rule be specified . fcic has been determined that the provisions of the rules that preempt page 3 gao/ogc-96-47 state and local-laws to the extent such state and local-laws are inconsistent with the rules meet those standards . page 4 gao/ogc-96-47
