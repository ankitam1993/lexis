proposal floated to study wingate 's winds friday june 7 , 2002 by brad bennett bbennett @ herald.com an environmental-expert may study the winds that flowed from the old wingate-landfill-incinerator 's smokestacks , and identify wide areas where people may have been exposed to toxic-chemicals . that was among the latest ideas suggested in a proposed study that would search for a link between the landfill 's contaminants and high rates of illness around it . black-community-leaders supported the study at a meeting on thursday , despite skepticism from government officials that the $ 120,000 earmarked for it may not be enough . ''not only is the money short , but time is even shorter , '' said ron wilson , ombudsman for the federal-agency for toxic-substances and disease registry , which will make the money available only if the health-study-proposal from legal-aid service of broward county is strong enough . friction between competing-community-groups nearly jeopardized the health-study , which must reach community-consensus and be funded by sept. 30 , 2003 . the proposal -- complete with a line-item-budget and commitments from participating-experts -- is expected to reach the state-department of health by july 8 . if the study bears out enough-facts to merit more research , the state could apply for another $ 120,000 in the second year . but the second grant is by no means guaranteed , wilson said , adding that his agency 's budget has already been cut by $ 6 million . ''the problem here is money , '' said frank estok , an environmental-engineer and health-specialist who works with legal-aid . `` we 're trying to get what we can for our dollar . '' the study-proposal goes beyond looking at a link between the landfill and high rates of cancer near it , and also seeks to study non-fatal-diseases such as skin-rashes , thyroid-disorders and abnormal-liver-function , among other illnesses . although a previous-version of the study sought to exhume the bodies of infants and to autopsy-babies whose mothers live in the area around the capped-landfill , the new version suggests that autopsy might have to be funded another way . the landfill , at 1300 nw 31st ave. in fort lauderdale , operated from 1954 to 1978 . some residents believe its contaminants made them sick , but no study has ever proven a link . the city has capped the landfill and wants to create a golf-course on the site . some black-community-leaders support those plans . others are focused on forcing the city to relocate residents and clean up toxic-chemicals now buried under the plastic-cap .
