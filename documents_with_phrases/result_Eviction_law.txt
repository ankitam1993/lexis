eviction-law is fine with local-tenant wednesday , february 20 , 2002 by ted roelofs as a husband , father and tenant of a grand rapids public-housing complex , aubrey robertson puts security at the top of his home priority-list . because of that , robertson is all for a zero-tolerance-drug-law in force at creston plaza apartments on grand rapids ' northeast side . that includes cases in which families may be evicted for the drug-use of a single-family-member , even off the premises . robertson sees it as a tool to keep his complex as clean and safe as possible . `` if there 's one person ( using-drugs ) , that is a start , '' said robertson , 52 , a native of jamaica . he has lived the past four years at creston plaza with his wife , tammy , and his daughter , precious , 3 . in recent months , robertson was pleased to see casual-drug-use at the complex diminish with the installation of security-cameras . `` if there is a start , then there will be some other problem . i totally agree ( if there is a drug-link ) , get them out . '' critics say the law -- argued tuesday before the u.s. supreme court -- tramples on individual-rights and harms the very people public-housing-authorities are supposed to help . `` it 's basically one strike and you 're out , and i think they went beyond what congress intended , '' said michael chielens , executive director of western michigan legal-services . `` someone who had no knowledge or involvement in a criminal-act is being punished . that 's kind of a basic due-process-notion that we have had in our legal-tradition for a long time . '' the case was brought by four oakland , calif. , senior-citizens , including 63-year-old great-grandmother pearlie rucker . they received eviction-notices because of the drug-use of relatives or caregivers . rucker was ordered out because her mentally disabled-daughter was caught with cocaine three blocks from the apartment she shared with her mother and other family members , court-records show . an appeals court blocked-enforcement of the law . at issue is whether housing-directors are being more aggressive than congress intended . the law was passed in 1988 and endorsed by the clinton administration in 1996 and by the bush administration last year . the law was written at a time when public-housing-complexes were under assault by drug-dealing-gangs and politicians were pressured to take action . families can be removed for drug-use by one member , whether the drug-activity is in the home or somewhere else . under the department of housing and urban development' enforcement-program , tenants may not avoid eviction simply by claiming-ignorance of the crime or an inability to stop it . carlos sanchez , executive director of the grand rapids housing commission , believes the law can be effective if it 's applied with discretion . the commission administers about 3,500 public-housing-units in the grand rapids area , including creston plaza . `` i think if it 's done with caution , it 's a tool that we desperately needed in our developments , '' sanchez said . sanchez said grand rapids does n't have the large-scale-drug problems larger cities do -- and he wants to keep it that way . `` we 've done the best we can to keep it from being so drug-infested it becomes a war-zone . once the development is taken over , it 's very difficult to take them back . '' sanchez said the commission relies on police-reports in deciding evictions , which he estimated at one or two a year . among those cases , according to leslie curry , litigation-director of western michigan legal-services , was that of a mother evicted from public-housing about a year ago with several young children . she was removed because her 17-year-old son was arrested selling drugs outside the apartment , curry said . that left her with the hardship of seeking a place she could afford for herself and her children , without the certainty she afford the rent . `` she did n't know about it , '' curry said of the drug-deal . `` in grand rapids , subsidized-housing is critical to people's ability to maintain basic-security in their lives .
