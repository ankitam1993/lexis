memorandum to : lsc board of directors from : randi youells , vice-president for programs date : january 8 , 2002 subject : strategic-directions 2000-2005 i am pleased to submit to you our report concerning the progress of the programs ' units and offices-primarily opp and the state-planning-team with some statistical and reporting-assistance from oim-in-terms of meeting the goals and objectives of your strategic-planning-document , strategic-directions 2000-2005 . i would like to put this report in its proper-perspective . we are all acutely-aware that our civil legal-services-delivery system is strained to the breaking-point . legal-services-programs nationally have been battered by economic-pressures and escalating demand . our grantees now estimate that they currently turn away four out of every five low-income-individuals who are seeking critical legal-assistance . courts are witnessing an unprecedented increase in the number of people who enter the justice-system-today lacking legal-representation and who are consequently forced to represent themselves in complex and complicated legal-proceedings . our communities are experiencing unrelenting-pressures as unresolved civil legal-problems result in homelessness , loss of self-sufficiency and growing-crime-rates . despite the hard-work and the advancements of the last thirty years , economic and social inequality coupled with racial and gender-based-discrimination continues to be the central-reality of our clients ' lives . the fact that we are now seeing second and third-generation-low-income people walk through our doors and sit in our waiting-rooms is a brutal-reminder that the realization of justice for many americans remains more an aspiration than a fact . lsc and our grantees live and work in a world that is marked by continual-challenges and crises . that is the bad news . the good news , however , can be found in reports like this one . reports that demonstrate that there are many people both within lsc and our grantee-programs and outside of our federally-funded-structure who care deeply about issues related to equal-justice and who have refused to take our many crises lying down . people like the staff at the legal-services-programs in new jersey , maryland , washington , texas , missouri , california , and indiana who are actively and continuously engaged in reassessing their delivery-practices and policies to meet emerging and unmet-needs . people like those legal-services heroes in arkansas , illinois , florida and alabama who have worked closely and in partnership with lsc to expand access to and enhance resources for legal-services-providers and their clients . people like my legal-services-friends in iowa , ohio , virginia , arizona and kentucky who have devoted years of their lives to the legal-services-movement . people like yourselves who in this era of diminishing-resources and escalating need have devoted time and energy to strengthening legal-services and helping to make essential-changes in that way we practice legal-services so that we can ensure that the phrase `` justice for all '' is not relegated to a sexy-slogan on a t-shirt or a banner . this report demonstrates that our grantees and the broader equal-justice-community are doing great-things for clients and are doing it more efficiently and effectively with fewer resources . but for me it demonstrates another very important-point . it shows that a small group of committed-individuals , the fourteen lawyers and five non-lawyers-professionals working in opp and on the state-planning-team ( michael genz , robert gross , anh tu , tim watson , cyndy schneider , reginald haley , melissa pershing , althea hayward , willie abrams , john eidleman , barb donnelly , monica holmen , joyce raby , glenn rawdon , jennifer bateman , lou castro , lisa thomas , gloria wood ) and pat hanrahan and wendy burnette in the executive office ( aided and abetted by john meyer and his wonderful-staff in oim ) -terrific , hard-working , experienced , conscientious individuals-are the heart and soul of lsc . without them breathing life into your strategic-plan , you would simply have a meaningless report that would be gathering-dust on a shelf down in our reprographics-department . i think this report shows that we have had an inordinately productive and successful-year . but we did n't do it alone . we did it with the help of the board and the other staff at lsc . we did it with the help and assistance of our grantees . we did it with the aid of consultants and other equal-justice-stakeholders . and we did it with the support of two terrific-presidents-john mckay and john erlenborn-who evidenced their commitment and support for the program 's initiatives in this document with their helpful-advice , their useful-feedback , their sometimes annoying-challenges and criticisms , and ultimately their unswerving-support for us , for our grantees and for the clients we are so privileged to serve . strategic-directions 2000-2005 progress-report strategic-directions 2000 - 2005 challenges lsc staff to expand the support offered to lsc-programs and to increase state-planning guidance specifically to improve clients ' opportunities to access a full-range of high quality civil legal-services . in response , staff has grown in size and capacity . the office of information-management ( oim ) , the office of program-performance ( opp ) , and the state-planning-team are now completely staffed . in 2001 , opp and the state-planning-team focused their hiring-activities on recruiting-individuals with expertise in critical-areas like diversity , technology , and organizational-development . innovations in staff-assignments and approaches have brought about more focused state-planning-efforts throughout the country and program-support that emphasizes strengthening-quality at individual-organizations and within the state legal-services-delivery structure . goals strategic-directions 2000-2005 , adopted by the lsc board of directors january 28 , 2000 , establishes two strategic-goals : by 2004 , lsc will dramatically increase the provision of legal-services to eligible-persons , which anticipates as outcomes : increasing-numbers of clients receiving appropriate-services . expanding-relevancy of delivery-systems to the most pressing-needs , with clients taking a leading-role . increasing-perception among low-income-individuals that they have recourse if they require civil legal-information , counseling , or representation . increasing the public-perception of the legal-system as successful in providing equal-justice . expanding federal-funding and other public and private-resources for legal-services . by 2004 , lsc will ensure that eligible-clients are receiving appropriate and high quality legal-assistance , which anticipates as outcomes : expanding-range , and improvement in the quality , of services provided by programs . increasing-consistency in the quality of legal-services-programs . achieving significant beneficial-results for clients as determined by outcome-measurements . strategies in order to achieve these goals , lsc is utilizing integrated strategies based in three essential-areas : 1 ) state-planning , 2 ) technology , and 3 ) program oversight : use of state-planning to integrate , coordinate , and increase resources available in every state and territory . objectives include : identifying the most important-issues involving the delivery in all 50 states , territories and dc . identifying the adequacy of existing-capacities and existing funding to address-issues of access and quality . expanding legal-capacity through coordination with other providers . recommitment to the provision of services to native americans and migrant-workers . developing-programmatic and financial-capabilities to reach more clients with a wider range of services . use of technology to improve access and client-service-delivery . objectives include : expanding the number of clients receiving some level of appropriate legal-advice and referral via technologically sophisticated-intake-advice and referral-systems . providing consistent , quality-information and assistance to a greater number of persons through computerized and web-based-self help-programs . supporting-quality-advocacy via video/teleconferencing , improved legal-research and information-gathering , improved-supervision and expanded training-opportunities through technology . fostering new or expanded-linkages with the providers , courts , pro-bono attorneys , and others working to provide legal-representation . use of program oversight to ensure quality and accountability . objectives include : improving the grant-management-process to utilize the information received to provide standards-based feedback to programs . undertaking regular-visits to programs to ensure consistent-program-quality and compliance . developing new information-systems that provide more accurate and useful-information about the work-programs perform which can be used for both evaluation and grants-management . working with grantees in each state to develop systems and procedures to ensure that legal-services-program staff receive appropriate-training and that the work in each state is performed in a coordinated manner . working with grantees and planners in each state to promote leadership-training , including local-board-training , and to promote client board member participation and training ( outreach to client leaders ) . lsc commitments achieved in 2001 use of state-planning commitment : broad-agreement by the civil-justice-community , including the courts and iolta-programs , on the values , purposes , and objectives of the state-planning-initiative . 2001 achievements in march of 2001 , lsc released building-state-justice communities : a state-planning report from the legal-services corporation . this publication examined-state-planning in 18 states as models for building various-components of a clientcentered , comprehensive , integrated state-justice-community . in april , lsc announced significant-changes in service-areas of 14 states . a special report to congress on state-planning and reconfiguration was released late in the year , along with the lsc board taskforce report on configuration , adopted by the lsc board of directors in november . in a number of states , additional-resources are now available for civil legal-assistance : successful-efforts by the tennessee alliance of legal-services ( the state-planning-entity ) to have bail-bond-fee legislation passed will result in an additional $ 2.5 million in state-funds for legal-service-programs . in western tennessee , a collaboration by two programs will bring over a million dollars in us department of housing and urban development ( hud ) fair-housing grants to tennessee . the illinois equal-justice commission ( illinois state-planning-body ) has begun a campaign to secure additional illinois general assembly funding for legal-services . a two-year-effort for more state-funding raised $ 70,000 to hire a public-relations-firm to coordinate the campaign . an additional $ 90,000 is expected over the next two months from corporate-donors and foundations . the three lsc-funded-programs in alabama have hired a statewide-director of development , an experienced-fundraiser who previously worked with the red cross and the girl scouts . the major-challenge is the alabama campaign for legal-services , where a consultant retained by the three programs did initial-preparation . these early-efforts were funded by a special-grant from the american bar-association litigation section ( $ 10,000 ) and matching lsc technical-assistance-funds ( $ 5,000 ) augmented by a $ 5,000 contribution made on a pro-rata-basis by the three programs . lsc currently provides over 90 % of the funding for legal-services in alabama , and realization of the need for diverse-funding is prompting the state-justice-community to create a development office that will seek diverse-funding for legal-services in alabama . in the first year of the campaign over $ 50,000 was raised , almost entirely from the legal-community . the south dakota state-bar has agreed to house the new access to justice coordinator position funded by iolta . access to justice is of paramount-importance for this year 's bar president . south dakota 's lsc-programs have jointly applied for us department of justice violence against women act funds . this is the first time they have collaborated on a funding-application that will benefit the entire-state . florida undertook a successful-effort to persuade the florida supreme court to amend the iota rule . the amended rule will result in banks paying higher interest rates on iota accounts , which could yield an additional $ 15 million dollars in iota revenues . the president of the florida bar is leading a florida justice-community campaign to obtain a minimum of $ 10 million dollars a year from the florida legislature . at present , the florida legislature does not fund civil legal-services for the poor . commitment : internal capacity and expertise to support meaningful-planning and plan-implementation consistent with the values , purposes , and objectives of the state-planning-initiative . 2001 achievements with the hiring of three fulltime-program-counsel or analysts in the last six months , the state-planning-team is now fully staffed ( in terms of the 2001 budget ) . all state-planning-team members have significant-field-program and legal-services leadership-experience . among the five-fulltime state-planning-team members ( barbara donnelly , robert gross , althea hayward , melissa pershing and timothy watson ) and two part-time-consultants ( chuck cook and joseph dailing ) there is a total of 260 years of field program experience.1 state planning-related-program-visits took place in alabama , georgia , louisiana , massachusetts , mississippi , missouri , montana , nevada , new jersey , new york , north dakota , oklahoma , oregon , south carolina , and south dakota . lsc executive and state-planning-staff were present and participated in community-stakeholder-meetings or statewide conferences in alabama , arkansas , california , colorado , connecticut , florida , indiana , iowa , kentucky , michigan , ohio , south dakota , tennessee , virginia and washington state . staff also attended meetings of the midwest project-directors association and southeast project-directors association during the course of the year . technical-assistance-funds were given to assist merging-programs in arkansas , iowa , north dakota , and pennsylvania . national-initiatives undertaken or completed in 2001 include : '' making-mergers-work '' workshop at the national nlada/aba equal-justice-conference in march . diversity in the legal-services-community conversations took place throughout 2001 involving-groups of program-directors , staff , clients , and board members from throughout the legal-services-community . 1 now that each unit is fully staffed , the lsc office of program-performance and its state-planning-team contain over 260 years of experience in lsc-funded-programs . many staff also have experience in other nonprofit-organizations that work as partners with our grantees , such as bar-associations , non-lsc funded legal-services-providers and social-welfare advocacy-groups . in all , there are 14 lawyers on opp and state-planning-staff . their efforts are enhanced by five other individuals who are not attorneys and two permanent part-time-consultants . their combined expertise includes resource-development , organizational-management , technology , migrant and immigration-law , access and intake-systems . prior to coming to lsc , six staff were executive-directors at their legal-services-programs and three were managing-attorneys . two staff from the lsc executive office assist opp and the state-planning-team members on a regular basis , and add almost forty years of experience in lsc-funded-programs to the rich-mix of talents . lsc has scheduled a meeting with its statewide-grantees for february 7-9 , 2002 . this meeting initially was scheduled for september 13-15 , 2001 . client-centered conference , april 25-28 in hershey , pennsylvania . fifty-one-conferees included 22 clients , 18 legal-services-staff , and 11 others including-judges and iolta staff and 16 organizational-representatives from lsc , nlada , and clasp . participants authored twenty papers that were distributed at the conference . client board member training at the 2001 nlada annual conference . commitment : lsc 's grant-making and regulatory-authority promotes expanded , effective , and efficient-state and local legal-services to low-income-persons . 2001 achievements grantees in 11 states received the maximum-grant-term of three years . arizona , arkansas , california , illinois , kentucky , new mexico , south carolina , tennessee , texas , virginia , and west virginia received three-year-terms as an acknowledgement of their '' significant progress toward the development of comprehensive , integrated-delivery-systems . '' grantees in 10 states received two-year-grant-terms ( 2002 and 2003 ) for demonstrating significant progress , though still needing additional-state-planning . those states are alabama , florida , georgia , louisiana , massachusetts , mississippi , montana , new york ( except for legal-services of new york city which will receive a three-year-grant ) , north carolina , and oklahoma . programs in michigan and the district of columbia received one-year-grant-terms for 2002 . lsc is in the process of a one-year review of its prior-reconfiguration-decision in michigan . grant-conditions , riders , or reporting-requirements are being added to a number of grant-awards to ensure continued broad-based , inclusive-state-planning . program-letter 2000-7 was sent to the field at the end of 2000 calling on each state to evaluate and report on their state-planning progress . reports began arriving late this year and are being reviewed ; lsc responses will be sent in early 2002 . use of technology commitment : statewide-technology-plans required as part of the state-planning-initiative . 2001 achievements in 2001 , lsc continued to play an active-role in encouraging and supporting-states ' technology-plans . lsc assisted several-states by participating in planning groups and providing-training on technology at statewide-trainings . some of the states were oklahoma , virginia , arkansas , nebraska , missouri , mississippi , and west virginia . technology-grants assisted implementation of state-plans . three grants in texas helped with merger-issues through integration of disparate-systems . grants made to arkansas and virginia aided in coordination of case-management-systems and building-systems for statewide-client-intake . twenty-eight-grants targeted statewide-web-sites , which encompass not only all of the lsc-programs in a state , but other state-justice-community partners . five national-technology-grants were made to assist states with the implementation of other technology-grants and technology planning . ( these national-grants are described in detail below . ) among them were : ■ a grant to support for implementation and content-management of statewide-web-sites . ■ a grant to link technical-expertise from other programs to technology-grantees at no cost to grantees . ■ a grant to create a web site to provide information on technology for all lsc-programs . commitment : technology and pro se initiative-grants to be awarded by lsc . 2001 achievements ninety-five technology-initiative-grant ( tig ) requests were received from 46 states and territories for a total of $ 19.2 million . fifty-five grants were awarded , with $ 7 million allotted for tig 2001 . twenty-eight-states received-grants for statewide-websites , 13 for technology-projects being undertaken on a statewide-basis ( including three for statewide-intake-systems ) . five grants with a national-scope were awarded ( see below ) . a tig conference was held in chicago in october to introduce this year 's grantees to the national-support-system that lsc has developed , with the assistance of numerous-grantees . these five national-support-grants will give our grantees more resources than they have ever had available to them for developing pro se tools for clients . the first two , lstech and legalmeetings , will be available to all lsc grantees , not just tig-recipients . in the first national-system , legal-services of southern michigan is creating a national-web-site ( www.lstech.org ) with resources on legal-services-technology . they will be working closely with ntap so that grantees with questions can log onto the web site and request-assistance from ntap . other partners on this grant are the university of michigan , providing-servers , and nlada , providing-content and technical-assistance . the next-grant is for a national legal-services virtual conferencing-center to be coordinated by gulf coast legal-services in houston . using webex hosting-services , our grantees will be able to meet electronically via the web . grantees can convene technology trainings , state-planning-sessions , and advocates meetings . the site that will facilitate this project is www.legalmeetings.org . a third national-system-grant , earmarked for the legal-aid society of cincinnati , will help grantees with project-evaluations . our grantee , working with the management-information exchange and experts on evaluations will create a national-evaluation-strategy to ensure that our grants improve access for clients to the fullest extent possible . building on work undertaken by last year 's grantees , lsc has approved grants to create 29 new statewide-web-sites . the majority will be housed on pro-bono net using their lawhelp-template . to assist programs with implementing these web sites , the northwest justice project and probononet in new york are hiring two full-time '' circuit-riders '' to assist grantees with content-management and to ensure that each web site supports the entire-state-justice community . the national technology assistance project ( ntap ) coordinated by the legal-aid society of orange county will help grantees with management or technology-issues arising from their grants . in addition , presentations on tig-funding-availability and the application-process took place at the national equal-justice-conference , the southeastern project-directors association meeting , the indiana access to justice-conference and virginia 's technology planning-meeting . commitment : working with grantees , lsc has developed and disseminated replicable-models for the effective and efficient-use of technology . 2001 achievements with tig 2000 , grants were made for two statewide-web-site templates . the theory behind these templates was to create a structure that could be replicated by other states with all of the functionality , but at a fraction of the cost . in tig 2001 , these templates will be used in 28 states . the cost to implement the technology-portion is only 20 % of the each grant ( $ 10,000 ) . the remainder will be used to coordinate content . this is a good-example of how lsc 's coordinating-efforts can result in large savings to our programs from replication . another tool being used for replication is the national grant for the technology-web-site ( lstech , described above ) . on this site , any program can find details on all of the technology-grants and avoid the expense and effort of creating new projects for their states . there will be technical-information on satellite internet access , video-systems , telephone , and a host of other subjects . lsc co-sponsored a case-management system conference in conjunction with the equal-justice-conference and participated in a session on how to help-advocates and staff use the technology-tools they already have . staff regularly confer with national center for state-courts , state-justice institute , the open society institute and justice management institute to facilitate pro se efforts , specifically encouraging-partnerships among our programs , the state-courts , bar-associations and community-organizations . meetings are also conducted with the national access to justice funders group ( lsc , open society , state-justice institute , national center for state-courts and the horowitz foundation ) on building broader justice-communities , statewide-web-sites , follow-up to the pro se collaboration conference , technology-support-systems and multi-lingual-access . in addition to the national-grants and the statewide-web-site grants , statewide-grants were made to virginia , arkansas , and nebraska to improve their intake and delivery-systems . virginia and arkansas will be implementing single-point of entry for all clients into the intake-system , even though each program will be doing its own intake . their case-management-systems will be running on an applications-service-provider ( asp ) . this means that no software will be needed to access their system , opening up the ability to do intake from any computer with internet access . this will help them expand intake , such as allowing pro-bono attorneys to do intake from their offices . through our planning-efforts , lsc is seeing many mergers of programs . to help with these mergers , lsc made several technology-grants to help-programs combine multiple-information systems into one integrated-system . examples of these are the three grants to each of the new programs in texas . as well as making new grants , staff continue to monitor the tig projects from last year . the minnesota and ohio grants to develop web-templates are being used as models for this year's statewide-web-site grants . the orange county i-can project was successfully completed and is being expanded with additional-monies this year . this project , working with the courts , district-attorney 's office , and libraries , placed self-help-kiosks in several-locations in orange county . the project has been so helpful to clients and the courts that the court-system is examining the project to see if it should be implement statewide . hawaii 's video project is completed and operational . this project is used to connect offices in the other islands to the main lash office in honolulu . this allows them to do follow-ups on their pro se clinics to insure they continue with the high success-rates . lsc is sharing what has been learned about the project with other interested programs . dna 's satellites are providing high speed-internet-access to all of their offices . before , many offices had to dial long distance-numbers to connect at very slow-speeds . they are installing their pro se kiosks and designing the web site that will allow persons throughout their service-area to obtain self-help information in their native-tongues . commitment : state-technology planning manual developed and disseminated . 2001 achievements the purpose of the technology planning manual is to provide executive-directors , technologists and/or technology-managers with a step-by-step-guide to successfully creating a statewide-technology-plan . the manual will identify the main-issues involved in planning successfully for technology and will capture information on planning , technology-standards , legal-services issues , and partner-communities . the proposed table of contents is as follows : ( 1 ) introduction ( purpose of the manual , how to use it , overview ) ( 2 ) process of planning ( staffing the group , identifying constituencies , timeline , funding the effort ) ( 3 ) components of a written-work plan ( state-technology support-structure , standards in key-technology-areas , i.e . lan/wan , hardware , software , connectivity , email , training , video-conferencing , etc . ) ( 4 ) implementation of the work-plan ( status-tracking , training , evaluations , periodic-reports , staffing on-going-support , funding statewide-efforts ) ( 5 ) funding ( success-stories , budgets , partnerships ) ( 6 ) other resources for help ( website-links to other resources and individuals ) using the national ntap grant ( see above ) lsc is gathering-information from experts within the legal-services-community to prepare this manual . we believe disseminating the broad-experience of this group of experts will be useful for state-planners and technology-managers . there was a planning-meeting to discuss the preparation of this manual at the tig 2001 conference in chicago and soon we will have a timetable for its completion . use of program oversight commitment : develop methods to assess program-quality , to ensure that case-handling staff are well trained and that the legal-work among programs is coordinated and of high quality . 2001 achievements lsc uses three primary-tools to assure quality in the programs that it represents : ■ the competition-process ; ■ quality-review-visits ; and ■ provision of support and technical-assistance to its recipients . in 2001 the corporation again used the competition-process to review programs assure quality . lsc 's competition criteria have been refined to ensure that lsc-recipients respond and adhere to performance-standards that result in effective legal-services for low-income-people . an extensive-guide has been developed for evaluations that considers each criterion and provides reviewers with standards against which to judge funding applications . in 2001 , lsc created a protocol for on-site-programs reviews , published as a `` program review guide . '' it is a reference tool for staff and consultants in reviewing-programs and to draft-reports and recommendations based on the reviews . program-reviews are one way to monitor program-development , solve problems , and establish new strategies for expanding-access and enhancing-quality . among other resources , the guide contains a sample-letter introducing the program to the review-process , a comprehensive-list of items to request prior to a visit ; a simplified work-form to capture information while on site ; a model-work-plan , a form to help determine the quality of the legal-work and suggestions for conducting personal-interviews . the implementation of the program review-process is discussed in the next-section . lsc engages in other efforts to increase quality . lsc personnel are frequently asked by grantees for assistance with various-aspects of running a successful-program . lsc can be a link between the person making the request and other programs that have addressed the same concern . in 2001 , lsc began to systematize this effort by creating the information-management project . the project 's purpose is to obtain and publicize information on model-practices , programs , and systems . a staff-member is engaged full-time in launching this effort . other activities that support increasing-program-quality undertaken in 2001 are : producing-draft-characteristics on intake , advice , and referral-system . lsc developed and distributed the document to the public for comment ; it will be final early in 2002 . contracting with the national center of poverty-law ( ncpl ) to provide training on legal-research for poverty-law-practice to legal-services-attorneys in ten states selected by lsc , and to write and distribute a desktop-research-manual on poverty-law . commitment : undertake a series of program-evaluation-performance pilot-projects that are intended to provide in-depth-understanding of unique-issues facing each program , more relevant and accurate reporting of program-activities and resource-utilization , performance-measures that describe and project-program-success , information that will lead to an improvement of the overall-effectiveness and efficiency of service-delivery . 2001 achievements the office of program-performance conducted twelve on-site-program-reviews in 2001 . under review were programs in florida , alabama , arkansas , new jersey , nevada , pennsylvania , oklahoma , massachusetts , and ohio . opp also organized a peer-review of the veterans consortium pro-bono program . these reviews allowed us to monitor program-development , to learn about problems and to suggest new strategies for expanding-access and enhancing-quality . commitment : design a new management-information-system to obtain more complete and accurate-information about the quality and level of work performed by each grantee and about outcomes achieved for clients . 2001 achievements in 2001 , lsc devised a method to measure other significant responsibilities that programs undertake to help clients , in addition to handling-client-cases . these `` matters '' consist of activities such as pro se work , community legal-education , and analyzing-client-problems for referral to other resources . programs have been counting `` matters '' since july 1 , 2001 . lsc 's first report on this activity is due in march of 2002 . the 2001 grant activity report ( gar ) cycle , including case-service-reports ( csr 's ) and the allied-self-inspection-process , has been successfully completed . the results of the self-inspection show a great-improvement in the accuracy of csr submissions , with the error-rate reduced 55 % , from an 11 % error-rate for 1999 csr 's to a 5 % error-rate for 2000 csr 's . with this reduction in error-rate , the csr 's now meet the standard of `` substantial-accuracy '' which was the objective when lsc initiated the self-inspection-process in 1998 . the total-cases reported to lsc for 2000 are 1,012,368 . while this total is nominally a slight-reduction from the 1,038,714 reported for 1999 , it is actually an increase because lsc had to adjust the 1999 total downward to 924,000 cases to take account of the high error-rate . with the great-improvement in the accuracy for 2000 , lsc can return to using the reported-figures without any adjustment . commitment : performance-standards will include criteria for ensuring that grantees have effective administrative-systems in place and that clients receive quality-assistance . lsc will provide regular-feedback to programs and applicants on the quality of their applications . 2001 achievements lsc has developed performance-guidelines for assessing grant-applications . these guidelines , embodied in the lsc competition evaluation guide , cover all aspects of program-performance including-components of the delivery-approach , management , legal-work-supervision , identifying and establishing the most critical legal-needs , coordination within the delivery-system , and experience and reputation . they track , and are built on the lsc performance criteria and aba standards for providers of civil legal-services to the poor . in spring 2002 , lsc will publish these guidelines . following the competition for 2003 , lsc intends to inform each applicant about how well their program met each criterion . commitment : review the competitive-grant making-process , the performance-standards applicable to lsc grantees , and lsc's statutory and regulatory-compliance-requirements for efficiency , unnecessary-duplication and implications for the delivery of high quality , appropriate legal-services . 2001 achievements additions to the 2002 request for proposal ( rfp ) include questions for applicants on staff-diversity , recruitment and retention-strategies and training , and the organization 's strategic-planning . rfp inquiries on technology and on state-planning were streamlined . some modifications resulted in more comprehensive-information on applicants ' proposed-subgrantee-relationships . lsc staff conducted telephonic applicant-information sessions or discussions on the application-process with interested-grantees and experts . another comprehensive-review of the competition-process is scheduled for the beginning of 2002 . commitment : lsc will seek additional-funds to increase the presence of lsc staff in the field . 2001 achievements with the hiring of new state-planning-team members as well as the additions of matilde-lacayo and monica holman to opp main and joyce raby in technology , there is now an opp main team-member and a state-planning-team member assigned to every state and territory . staff are also able to assume special-initiatives and projects and to participate in national , regional and statewide meetings and conferences . additional-program-outcomes achieved in 2001 the development of a state-planning evaluation instrument an rfp was created , proposals reviewed and a consultant hired in 2001 to design a state-justice-community outcomes measurement tool . soon lsc will be in a position to quantitatively evaluate the impact of state-planning ; for now we will demonstrate that state-planning-activities have caused beneficial-outcomes for state-justice-communities , outcomes that position-programs to achieve : increased number of clients receiving appropriate legal-services . expanded relevancy of the delivery-system to the most pressing-needs of lowincome-clients increased-perception among low-income-individuals that they have recourse if they require civil legal-information , counseling or representation . increased public-perception of the legal-justice-system as successful in providing equal-justice . expansion of federal-funding and other public and private-resources dedicated to meeting civil legal-needs of eligible low-income-clients . expanded range and improved-quality of services provided by legal-services-programs . greater-consistency in the quality of legal-services-programs . significant beneficial-results for low-income-clients , as determined by outcome-measurements . the creation of efforts to link with the international justice-community lsc has moved into a leadership position in the international legal-aid-community . in june 2001 and again in december 2001 , lsc vice-president for programs randi youells participated in conferences that brought together-leaders and visionaries from the legal-services-community in common-law countries ( australia , england , new zealand , scotland , ireland , wales , canada and the united states along with germany and the netherlands ) and southeast asian-countries to discuss emerging legal-issues , government and alternative-funding-sources , access , technology and other urgent-concerns facing-providers of legal-services to poor-clients around the world . addressing the pan pacific legal-aid conference-participants , randi youells observed that now , largely as a result of strategic-planning , `` lsc has more efficient-programs , new partnerships with unlikely-stakeholders , powerful new funding-sources , strong-allies among the judiciary and the private-bar , and state and local governments have become more sensitive to the needs of low-income-clients . '' in australia , in remarks titled why legal-services has to change , youells said , `` over the last-several years , the legal-services-community in the united states has pursued a fundamental review of our delivery-system-the most far-reaching and challenging we have ever undertaken . the objective has been to create coordinated and integrated equal-justice-communities , which live up to the values and ideals which legal-services-programs were initially created to protect , but which also make sense in this new and ever-changing-environment . '' lsc 's diversity-initiative in conjunction with the national legal-aid and defender association ( nlada ) , lsc launched a series of conversations on diversity in 2001 . over the year , eight separate-conversations on broad-issues of diversity including-disability , age , gender , race , sexual-orientation and ethnicity took place . several were three or four hour-discussions with small-groups of staff-attorneys , directors , or clients . there was also a two-day national-conference on diversity in the legal-services-community , a first for lsc and nlada . fifty leaders from around the country participated . reports on each event will be the foundation for an action-agenda for lsc and the legal-services-community . suggestions and observations raised by client and staff participants at the eight-diversity-events intensified lsc 's focus on diversity . applicants for lsc-funds must now describe efforts underway to cultivate new leadership in their program and in the state-justice-community , including how they ensure that leadership is diverse . state-justice-community self-evaluations include a series of inquiries on the diversity-work advanced by a state's plan and related-activities . moreover , lsc has hired a state-planning-staff person whose area of expertise and emphasis is diversity . she will assist state-justice-communities with this critical-initiative . lsc vice-president for programs randi youells repeatedly emphasized-diversity and inclusion in her speeches to the legal-services-community . keynote-addresses for the maryland legal-aid bureau staff-retreat and the annual-state planning-meeting in south carolina provided-opportunities to highlight lsc 's support for multi-cultural-competence in program-staff along with expanded outreach to marginalized-client-communities . lsc retained a consultant to review staff-data submitted annually by grantees , and report on the diversity-trends the statistics show . while executive-directors of color or who are women in our programs has not diminished in spite of a decreasing number of programs ( from reconfiguration ) the number of women leaders and leaders of color is small compared with their numbers in our pool of attorneys and other professional-staff . the results of these data will further inform the action-agenda , noted above . increased quality and services through state and region collaborations in several-states and regions , collaborations around client-issues have resulted in the expansion of services to clients . a benefit of tennessee 's fair-housing-efforts ( noted earlier ) is that lsc-funded-programs in mississippi , in collaboration with west tennessee legal-services , will receive a three-year hud grant of $ 350,000 to develop and administer a fair-housing initiative in mississippi . initially , west tennessee legal-services , a program that has many years of experience in running hud projects , will oversee the grant . gradually-administration will be transferred to south mississippi legal-services , which will hire a project-coordinator . together , the three other mississippi lsc-programs will receive $ 99,000 to implement the initiative in their service-areas under the guidance of the project-coordinator . new jersey continued its comprehensive-efforts to ensure that each legal-services-program in new jersey was integrated with the others such that all providers had a `` critical-mass '' of attorneys on staff , allowing for specialization . further , their efforts allowed all attorneys in all of the providers to understand their role as part of a statewide-delivery-system . missouri created the missouri legal-services commission to , among other tasks , ensure that all of the missouri delivery-system components work together . massachusetts ' providers have formed the advocacy coordinating group ( acg ) with the participation of all lsc and non-lsc-programs , combining-expertise across practice-areas to address broader issues such as access to employment , quality of education and barriers to service . the acg identifies gaps in services around the state relating to these issue-areas along with making-recommendation about how best to address those gaps . in illinois , lsc and non-lsc legal-services-programs are collaborating with chicago kent college of law to establish the illinois center for law and technology ( tech center ) . the tech center will offer training , information , and other support to legal-services-attorneys , paralegals , pro-bono attorneys and clients . the lawyers trust-fund of illinois and the chicago bar-foundation funded the first year of operation . lsc/tig funds will support the second year of operation , allowing the tech center to develop and expand resources to include video streaming-training , legal-research , community legal-education-materials and other supportive services . the tech center is governed by a board of directors composed of representatives of the collaborative-partners , and is currently housed at chicago kent college of law . in 2001 , california held its largest meeting of legal-services-staff and stakeholders since 1982 . during this year also , california 's access to justice commission , legal-aid association and the lsc-funded-program directors agreed to focus on delivery of legal-services in rural areas , including the reallocation of resources . adoption of uniform `` core-priorities '' in 2001 , california followed the lead of other states ( new jersey , north carolina , florida , and washington state ) and adopted uniform `` core-priorities '' for all programs to assure consistency of service throughout the state . in california , there are 102 legal-services-programs funded by the state 's legal-services trust-fund program ( iolta ) , including 78-field-programs and 24 support programs serving an eligible-population of almost five million poor-people , speaking 224 languages . of the field-programs , eleven are lsc-funded . california 's planning and collaborative-efforts in the last year have been numerous and complex , reflecting the state's many programs , languages , clients and needs . the legal-aid association of california ( laac ) is a membership-organization of legal-services-programs staffed by the public-interest clearinghouse . it is the entity in california responsible for state-planning , and has already adopted core-principles for a comprehensive integrated-system for the provision of legal-services in the following topical-areas : ■ meaningful-access to justice ■ client-centered-planning ■ stable and adequate-resources ■ continuum of services ■ innovative and responsive-delivery-system ■ program-evaluation ■ coordination of regional and state-planning ■ special-needs-communities ■ expansive-partnerships to increase resources ■ cultivating-leaders of tomorrow collaboration of legal-services-programs and the courts in many states , legal-services-programs and the courts are working closely together to expand access to the judicial-system . north carolina and arkansas held their first equal-justice conferences . members of the judiciary were critical in the design of the curriculum and as panelists . in march , massachusetts held an extremely well attended statewide pro se conference . the state-justice-community and the courts are now developing the goals and strategies that resulted from that event . nevada legal-services has led the development of pro se clinics in the state . in conjunction with legal-services of clark county , a non-lsc program , and the clark county judicial-system , nls has established a family-law self-help-center , located in the clark county-courthouse across from the clerk 's office . nls employees staff the center , supervised by a county-employee , who is a lawyer . in the near-future , the center wants its forms on line so that clients can provide the information and forms will be generated automatically . the center also offers educational-seminars to potential self-help-clients . a similar-center has been established in washoe county ( reno ) . a housing-self-help-center has been established in las vegas . it is staffed by nls employees as well . more recently , nls staff has joined with the nevada supreme court and others to draft a uniform-set of pleadings that can be used in family-court throughout nevada . currently nevada has no uniform-set of forms , and local-variations often pose barriers for pro se clients . the supreme court of washington created a new task-force on civil equal-justice funding . to enhance our programs ' work in these areas , lsc vice-president randi youells spoke before the conference of chief judges/conference of state-court administrators taskforce on pro-se-litigation . in her remarks she urged the judges and court administrators to ( 1 ) initiate efforts with local and state-bar associations to overcome resistance to pro se activities and self-represented-litigants ; ( 2 ) study selfrepresented-litigants to determine how many of them would have hired ( and could have afforded ) a private-attorney at the time that they were denied services by a legal-services-program ; and ( 3 ) promote acceptance of the practice of `` unbundling '' legal-services .
