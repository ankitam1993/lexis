a helping-hand for helping-hands inland valley march 9 , 2002 mancy mintie 's uncommon-good organization pays the school debts of attorneys and health-care-workers dedicated to serving those less fortunate . by joanna corman / joanna.corman @ latimes.com linda samels ceballos entered loyola law-school in los angeles knowing she wanted to represent the poor . she graduated in 1995 owing $ 58,000 in loans . she was about to run out of means to pay back those loans when she took a job at the inner city law center in los angeles , a firm that fights slum-landlords . it was there that she met nancy mintie . mintie , a claremont-resident , made it possible for ceballos to represent poor-clients against wealthy-landlords , a calling about as low-paying as lawyer-jobs get , and pay off her loans at the same time . `` it kind of stepped in at the right-time , '' said ceballos , who has loan-payments averaging $ 800 a month and whose starting-salary was $ 30,000 . `` because of the program , i 've been able to stay here . ... there was no way i could make that payment . i barely make it now with my regular-bills . '' mintie , who turns 48 this month , started uncommon-good in december 1999 . the nonprofit-operation pays the debts of attorneys and health-care-professionals who work with the poor . it grew out of her work at the inner city law center , which she founded in 1980 , and often depended on the skills of young-lawyers with a social-conscience . in 1998 , she stepped down from her role as director . over the next year she realized she needed-incentives to keep lawyers around after they got a few years of experience . not only were there fewer attorneys entering the field of poverty-law , some were being driven out of the profession . the reason : with attorneys one year out of graduate-school facing an average-debt of just less than $ 90,000 and starting-salaries at legal-aid-organizations averaging $ 31,000 , they could n't afford the job . `` it really had become an economic-impossibility to take these jobs and survive on them , '' mintie said . `` that finding became the wake-up-call for me and hopefully it will be the wake-up-call for others in a community that cares about access to justice for the poor . '' her career started more than 20 years ago in a garage behind a catholic worker soup-kitchen on skid row in los angeles . she lived on a $ 3-a-week stipend that she spent on pantyhose and bus fare . her law-practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against l.a. slumlords , allowing poor-families to set up college-funds and buy homes . in all those years , she never lost a case . when she stepped down , she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty-law . `` i realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole-generation of public-interest-lawyers , '' she said . `` it had gone from being an economic-sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic-impossibility . ... the whole-system has essentially collapsed . '' mintie also started to ask questions about the medical-field . almost every person who walks into a free medical-clinic , she said , faces some legal-problem such as an eviction or the loss of social-security-benefits . and many of her clients had medical-problems from living in slum-housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat-bite-fever , a nonfatal-malady that particularly affects children . mintie noticed that health-care-professionals were graduating with staggering-debts and also could n't afford to work with the poor . her work was noticed by oprah winfrey , who invited her on the tv show march 26 , 2001 . mintie received a $ 100,000 `` use your life award '' from oprah 's angel network , a nonprofit-organization that awards-money to those who help others . mintie said that all of the money has gone to her recipients -- none was spent on overhead . she will be out of funds by spring . she is trying to get religious-organizations to sponsor recipients . it is a secular-organization , but one that grew out of mintie 's religious-convictions . `` i was raised catholic . i think the tradition for compassion for the poor encouraged that gift in me , '' she said . `` my faith said , 'yes , this is right . ' `` she said she hopes that religious-organizations see the link between their beliefs and her work . `` for so long there has been such misunderstanding between the religious-community and the work-lawyers do for the poor . the work that we do is the purest form of expression of the core-values of all of the major-faith-traditions . '' uncommon-good has a few religious-sponsors , including her church , our lady of the assumption in claremont , where mintie plays piano daily at the 6:30 a.m. mass . fourteen-people now receive money from uncommon-good . debt-payments can be as low as $ 300 a month and as high as $ 2,000 . some recipients grew up poor and want to give back , while others feel the need despite having a middle-class-upbringing . but a commonality among some of them was a decision all faced -- should they leave their jobs for higher-paying-ones ? their low-salaries and high debt-payments were making it impossible to live . recipients include lisa levsen , 33 , a doctor who graduated from usc medical school with $ 144,000 in debt and monthly-loan-payments of $ 1,200 . she works as the head-physician at the los angeles mission , a free-clinic on skid row . and william martinez , 28 , who cut his medical-school-studies short because he could n't afford the $ 39,000 in loans after two years of graduate-school and four years of college . martinez works two jobs as a physician 's assistant and supports his elderly parents and 8-year-old son . uncommon-good has a 22-member board of doctors , lawyers and representatives of christian-groups and is recruiting-mentors . one goal is to get the state-legislature to pass a law to provide loan-forgiveness to medical-professionals and lawyers who work with the poor . mintie said she hopes her organization can be a national-model for other professions . she is trying to bring legal-aid-services to the inland valley -- the closest legal-aid-office is in el monte and represents 700,000 poor-people throughout the san fernando , san gabriel and inland-valleys . `` unless the legal-aid is in the community , you ca n't say you are serving the poor , '' mintie said . neal dudovitz is the executive director of neighborhood legal-services of los angeles county , the legal-aid-office in el monte . he sees attorneys new to poverty-law leave all the time because they ca n't afford the salary with their law-school-debt . `` she 's really opened a lot of eyes in terms of having people understand how the educational-debt is limiting and reducing the services that are available to low-income-communities , '' dudovitz said . `` nancy is light-years ahead of the curve on this stuff . very little is being done practically to solve it . '' mintie , her colleagues say , could have made a lot of money in private-practice . `` she 's very kind and pleasant , '' said julius thompson , 45 , an attorney at inner city law center and an uncommon-good recipient . `` but she 's also a woman on a mission . when she sets her sights on something , she 's a formidable-force .
