terrorist attack upstages legal-services initiative , but provides greater urgency for it by thomas adcock one morning last year , david bookstaver arrived at work in lower manhattan and literally pulled the plug on the first official news of what is surely the most substantial-initiative for pro-bono publico in the history of the new york state unified court-system - establishment of the `` access to justice-center , '' the first court-sponsored entity in the nation to address the shortfall of civil legal-services to the poor . as communications-director for the courts , mr. bookstaver ordinarily has the duty of spreading such news across the state . but on the morning in question , mr. bookstaver , a former journalist , knew there was only one story to be told : the big one still making-headlines , known as simply `` 9/11 . '' mr. bookstaver was himself caught up in the middle of that big story , walking along west street on the way to his office . at 9:03 a.m. , the second terrorist- piloted-plane of the day screamed overhead , then slammed into the south-tower of the world-trade center . with building-debris and an ocean of smoke and dust pouring down from the sky , mr. bookstaver ran for his life - four blocks southeasterly to the office of court administration at 25 beaver street . he would later tell a new york law journal reporter of the '' deafening , thunderous , whistling-noise that was like a missile - a sound i never hope to hear again . '' finally , he was safe inside oca-headquarters , part of a 30-story complex . but even there , he recollected , the walls shook and a telephone slid off his desk as the twin-towers of the former world-trade center imploded and collapsed . he spotted his assistant , mai yee , at the fax-machine . she had just sent the official news to the first contact on her list : the law journal . `` i took the cord out of the wall from the fax-machine , '' mr. bookstaver said in a recent-interview . `` i said , 'look , i 'm not going to send out something that 's terribly-important that could be construed as trivial . ' `` meanwhile in albany , three top-jurists were set to back up the news release with a press conference - chief-judge judith s. kaye , chief administrative-judge jonathan lippman and judge juanita bing newton , deputy-chief administrative-judge for justice-initiatives . but never mind , news of the justice-center - all the more important in the wake of sept. 11 , an event that left-thousands more new yorkers impoverished - would have to wait . mr. bookstaver's reasoning for the delay went deeper than journalistic-instinct , back to his years as press-officer for the emergency-services unit of the new york fire department . with reference to the devastation he witnessed , he said , `` most people would think that with all those firefighters that it was ok , that things were under control . but i know too much . i knew that friends of mine were dying in those buildings . '' thus , the consensus-building for the justice-center 's main-order of business - the creation of a working-structure for the orderly donation of legal-services by the private-bar - did not commence until last june , with the first of four pro-bono convocations held at the manhattan campus of fordham university school of law . two more convocations are scheduled for october : at the state-university of new york campus in buffalo on oct. 15 ; and at albany law-school on oct. 25 . the final-convocation is set for nov. 8 in geneva at the ramada inn . notes on the wide-ranging-discussions at each convocation will be compiled by judge newton 's office and submitted to the court of appeals for further consideration . public-service bar-exam at the same time , though in a far less formal way , consensus building also began in june for yet another far-reaching-proposal for the courts ' consideration , one with a distinctive pro-bono element - the so-called public-service alternative bar examination . within the next several weeks , the association of the bar of the city of new york and the new york state-bar-association will issue a joint-report , based largely on the findings of a three-year-study by kristin booth glen , a former-state supreme court judge and dean of the city university of new york school of law . the report will recommend a pilot-project of up to two years' duration to assess the effects of substituting public-service for the multi-state-law-segment of the current-bar-exam . at personal option , law-school-graduates could perform supervised-work in the courts instead of demonstrating their ability to memorize tracts of black-letter-law . in an essay scheduled for publication next month in the columbia law review - titled `` thinking out of the bar-exam box : a challenge and proposal for change '' - dean glen contends that public-service , scored by specially trained evaluators , would be a more useful-test of future-lawyers ' potential than rote-memory , and would simultaneously strike down what she sees as unfair-barriers for poor-people and minorities seeking-entry to the legal-profession . in a copy of her essay for the columbia law review , dean glen suggests that students opting for public-service could help fill what chief-judge kaye and others have championed in the wake of sept. 11 : the need to maintain the historic-outpouring of volunteer lawyering , and increase the spirit of volunteerism . `` the [ alternative-exam ] would require applicants ... to work as lawyers in the court-system for 10 to 12 weeks , performing a variety of tasks , '' dean glen writes in her essay . `` [ t ] he court-system has an enormous need for additional-lawyer-assistance ... . [ t ] he chief-judge has created numerous worthy-justice-initiatives [ but because ] there is little or no additional-funding ... the courts must rely on pro-bono legal-services if those initiatives are to be successful . `` placing [ bar ] applicants for three months contributes to , but does not solve the courts ' needs , '' the essay continued . `` this is why those who elected the [ alternative-exam ] would have an additional obligation-150 pro-bono hours owed to the court-system in the three years following-admission . `` for every 200 successful [ alternative-exam ] takers , the courts would have 30,000 pro-bono hours of service , to be utilized as the courts found most compelling . as an additional-advantage , all of that pro-bono-service would be done by attorneys already-familiar with and trained in the courts they would serve . '' as an example of urgent pro-bono need , dean glen cited the civil-court of new york , the nation 's busiest . in landlord-tenant-disputes , small-claims and housing-matters , high numbers of poor litigants must argue pro se . only some of them receive help from the civil-court 's self-representation office , which dean glen termed a `` valiant-attempt '' at fair-resolution . in the press release delayed by mr. bookstaver last september , judge lippman was more forceful in assessing the need for pro-bono . `` the state of civil legal-services has reached a turning point in new york , '' judge lippman said in the release . `` ninety percent of all tenants appearing in housing court - many facing-eviction from their homes - do not have an attorney . and while the demand is great , the supply is shrinking . `` [ t ] he new york state access to justice-center ... will galvanize our efforts to find permanent civil legal-service funding streams , and i am confident that it will make significant-headway in this important-area of public-interest . '' among the approximately 150 lawyers at the fordham convocation was kevin j. curnin , a senior-associate at stroock & stroock & lavan llp and attorney-director of the firm 's public-service project . `` we heard a lot of good-ideas from people who 've been contributing for many years to pro-bono-service , '' said mr. curnin . `` we have to sift through all the ideas and decide what 's best for the state , and how to accommodate our differences . we do things differently in new york city , for instance , than upstate . '' he added , `` we 've made a good-start . '' frederick p. rooney , director of the community legal resource network at cuny law , identified a major-task ahead in meeting chief-judge kaye 's hopes for keeping the pro-bono ball rolling : legislation . `` we 've got to reduce the liability of lawyers willing to engage in pro-bono , in much the same way the good samaritan law protects doctors who stumble onto accidents and provide care , '' said mr. rooney , who is also a general-practice-partner in rooney , mannicci & gardner llc of bethlehem , pa. on the public-service alternative bar examination , mr. curnin was reserved . `` it will be a lightning-rod for controversy , '' he predicted . `` but a new idea like that , as bold as it is - that's what you 'd expect . '' taking-note of the generally conservative-impulse of new york's legal-community , mr. curnin suggested that the multiple pro-bono aspect of dean glen 's sweeping-proposal could be lost on judges who might dismiss the matter in terms of a bar-exam procedural-issue with a `` social good '' patina . `` a lot of people are going to look at it and say , 'well , i took the exam the way it is and that 's what i had to do it , '' ' said mr. curnin . `` what i 'd love to see is this [ alternative-bar-exam ] in conjunction with an increase in legal-work for the poor at law-school clinics . '' perhaps if the economic-doldrums continue , and the poor get poorer , the pro-bono increase that mr. curnin and others want will indeed occur . there does seem to be a relationship between the state of the economy and the amount of free legal-service that big-firms , at least , are willing or able to perform . two years ago , american lawyer magazine ( a sister-publication of the law journal ) found that during the fat-year of 1999 , the approximately 50,000 lawyers at the nation 's 100 highest-grossing firms spent an average of eight minutes a day on pro-bono-cases , or about 36 hours per year , which is down significantly from an average 56 annual-hours during the recession-year of 1992 . the american bar-association recommends that private-firm-attorneys contribute 50 hours per year to pro-bono-work . by contrast , new york 's volunteers of legal-service recommends 30 hours . esther f. lardent , director of the pro-bono institute at georgetown university law center , said the good economic-times of the late '90s saw-lawyers at large-firms suddenly-responsible for as many as 2,300 billable-hours per year , compared with the less time- consuming and more typical 1,700 hours . poverty-law-agencies , too , have recently registered fewer hours of service to clients who most needed legal-help . in 1996 , a republican-controlled congress prohibited-lawyers receiving federal-funding - the mainstay of nearly all poverty-law-offices - from engaging in class-action-lawsuits and matters involving-abortion , illegal-immigration or challenges to reduced welfare-benefits inaugurated by president clinton and some other democrats . but even in good-times - for lawyers , at least - there remain two seemingly immovable stumbling-blocks for private-attorneys willing to go to bat for poor-people caught up in civil-court matters : corporate-lawyers whose transactional-work seldom takes them inside a live-courtroom full of emotional , frightened-civilians and testy-judges may feel like fish out of water in the great-sea of pro-bono-work : divorce and child-custody-issues , landlord-tenant suits , workers ' compensation and social-security claims . in a recent-interview , chief-judge kaye noted-efforts by the city bar and by emergency-consortia of large manhattan firms to address this concern . `` we saw a whole new model develop - a holistic-approach to lawyering , one-stop-shopping , '' she said . `` corporate-lawyers received brush-up-training from the [ city bar ] , and a given firm without certain-expertise felt free to call on another firm that had it . '' the result for pro-bono clients traumatized by sept. 11 , said chief-judge kaye , was more efficient-delivery of needed service : emotional , frightened-clients had only one contact to make , no matter how many problems they had ; the lawyers would sort out the mess . one of the principal-functions of the access to justice-center , she said , would be to foster such a holistic-approach . the slowly grinding wheels of justice on the second point , judge newton said in a recent-interview , '' i 've heard this complaint a hundred times . an attorney arrives [ in civil-court ] at 9:30 in the morning , hoping the matter can be taken care of in an hour . but then for a whole-range of reasons , the case might not be heard until late in the afternoon - if at all that day . '' in meetings around the state , judge newton has invited court administrators to suggest solutions to such complaints . a solution that makes most sense , she said , would be to change calendar procedures in order to expedite hearings where pro-bono counsel are scheduled to appear . `` we can solve this if we keep working together , '' said judge newton . with reference to the dramatic-increase in pro-bono after sept. 11 , she added , `` the first thing i learned is that there is a great-passion among lawyers and judges to focus on access to justice , no matter what problems we have to solve . `` the second thing i learned is the importance of collaboration among judges , bar-associations , private-attorneys and civil legal-service-providers . if we get everybody to the table , we'll crystallize these problems and turn our focus onto solutions that will work . '' meanwhile , mr. rooney suggested that lawyers might individually elect to do more reduced-fee or `` low-bono '' work - in the manner of the new york firm marcos & negron llp . last year , the aba presented the firm with its pro-bono publico award , despite the fact that marcos & negron does not work for free . `` but they do outstanding-work at reduced fees , and it was good to see that encouraged by the aba , '' said mr. rooney . his own firm in bethlehem , he said , operates under the marcos & negron philosophy . `` we make a decent-living . sure , it would be great to make a lot more . but when you represent a client in desperate need of service who may not have the required retainer - guess what ? `` that person will come back to you when they have a personal-injury case , or some other case that has the chance of substantial economic-gain , '' he said . `` kindness can pay off .
