new york daily news tuesday , may 7 , 2002 advocate for poor has own obstacles greg wilson former-prosecutor michael mazzariello was finally doing the kind of legal-work he 'd always dreamed of , but after less than a year of helping east new york 's poor , he 's getting booted from the bodega he turned into an office . nearly a year ago , mazzariello , a former-assistant-district attorney who grew up in east new york , started a nonprofit-practice helping the working poor navigate the legal-system . immigration , landlord-tenant-disputes and even criminal-cases are the specialty of his east new york legal-services corp. on new lots ave . the office , in a former-bodega , was mazzariello 's idea , and he got some help from high places early on . `` i picked up the phone and called rudy giuliani on his radio program , '' mazzariello said . `` i said , 'mr . mayor , we 're interested in renting-space in a building the city owns . `` i swear , within an hour , the building was ours . we filled out all the paperwork . we got the nonprofit-status from the feds . we were rolling . '' refusing to charge clients , mazzariello , 42 , said he used his family 's savings to sustain the office during the first year . already recognized as a federal-nonprofit , the agency is awaiting state-status that would allow it to survive on charitable donations . `` this is what i want to do - to give back to the community , '' said mazzariello , who worked under brooklyn district-attorney charles hynes from 1990 to 1993 , followed by a stint as the board of education 's chief-prosecutor . under the city-housing preservation and development department's tenant-ownership-program , mazzariello and partner joe guzzo learned they could rent to own . they invested $ 8,500 in a new facade , rest room-makeover and other modest-improvements . another bidder then , last week , mazzariello got bad news from the department . a tenant in the building had put in an application to buy it first . program-guidelines give tenants-priority over commercial-users . department spokeswoman carol abrams said homeownership comes first , even over community-minded-agencies like mazzariello 's . `` we give priority to the residential-tenants because we 're a residential-housing-agency , '' abrams said . julio montalvo , whose parents live in one of the two residential units above the storefront legal-practice , plans to buy the property . he did not say how much he was paying , but he said the units are rent-controlled . that makes getting fair-market-value for the commercial-space a must . that could amount to several times as much as the $ 250 a month mazzariello currently pays the housing preservation and development department . `` i embrace the kind of business he is running , '' montalvo said . `` but we did n't go into this in bad-faith . everything being done here is being done properly . if he has a beef , he should take it to '' the department .
