the bergen county record legal-aid unit fights for survival merger expected to replace criticized office douglass-crouse friday , november 8 , 2002 for more than half a century , the passaic county legal-aid society has fought on behalf of the county 's poor , in disputes ranging from housing to child-custody to public-assistance . but for the last-several years it has often done that job poorly , according to state and federal-officials . and barring a long-shot legal-victory , as of jan. 1 the autonomous-county-office will be replaced by a new agency whose administrators will report to a director based in jersey city . federal legal-aid-officials drew up the new service-area-uniting bergen , hudson , and passaic-counties in june , insisting the change will trim administrative-costs without compromising-services . the passaic county-office and its supporters see it differently . they say top-decision-makers will be too far from the individuals and non-profit-agencies that rely on the office for help . and in a federal-lawsuit , the agency 's leadership argues that a merger would jeopardize its educational-programs and minority hiring-efforts , and that its imposition amounts to bureaucratic-bullying by state and federal-officials . those same officials have repeatedly accused the passaic county-office of mismanagement . reviews since 1995 have found evidence of shoddy-accounting , poor-morale , excessive-staff-turnover , and double-counting of cases - and alleged that the office made limited-efforts to rectify the problems . at times in recent years , the office has received its state and federal-funding on a month-to-month-basis , which one federal-official called `` one step short of defunding . '' leaders of the county-agency , which employs 14 attorneys , five paralegals , and nine-support-staff at offices in paterson and wanaque , say officials have `` greatly-exaggerated '' the office's problems , which they call mostly-bureaucratic . `` just let them argue that their [ merger ] plan makes sense , '' maxim thorne , the office 's deputy director , said of the higher-level legal-aid-officials . `` they could never replicate our services or equal the accumulated value of this office . '' over the summer , the office reapplied for a federal-grant to serve passaic county in the coming year . but legal-services corp. in washington rejected the application , saying it failed to address the service needs of the entire tri-county-area - a requirement under the new rules . by mid-december , the federal-body is expected to award passaic county 's federal-funding - about $ 385,000 this year - to northeast new jersey legal-services , the tri-county-agency . state-funds of about $ 1.6 million could follow , although thorne noted the state appropriated $ 927,000 of that amount through june 2003 . the state treasury department 's legal-services-representative did not return repeated calls for comment . last week , a u.s. district-court judge refused to order an extension of the existing-office 's federal-funding as it fights the merger-plan . thorne said he may appeal . timothy k. madden , director of hudson county legal-services and soon-to-be-head of the tri-county-agency , said he will open a paterson office by jan. 1 , giving-priority in hiring to staff laid off from the current-office . `` i 'm confident that passaic county 's low-income-residents will be served better than what they get now , '' madden said , adding he had not yet settled on a location . anna navatta , who controls a $ 1.4 million budget as head of bergen county legal-services , will become deputy director of the tri- county-office . she said the bergen office will otherwise remain intact . `` we actually hope to expand our services as a result of the merger , '' she said . by contrast , under the consolidation executive director john atlas and thorne will likely lose their jobs , which last year brought them $ 131,319 and $ 114,031 , respectively . `` this is not about job-security for me and maxim , '' atlas said . `` our sole-motivation is to save what i think is an essential service and innovative-program . '' passaic county legal-aid works on behalf of about 4,000 individuals each year , and provides lowfee legal-help for about 20 non-profit and faith-based-groups . its many supporters argue that the office 's expansion of community-development-work - including helping-non-profits incorporate or defend themselves in lawsuits - sets it apart from other agencies . rep. william pascrell jr. , d-paterson , who has sought to mediate the dispute , wrote of his concerns , `` we are not aware of any stakeholder who was consulted on this sudden-proposal , no less any that support it . '' the agency also has a lauded-history of activism . in response to its lawsuit in 1999 , a judge ordered the paterson housing authority to correct a defective-relocation-plan for residents at the christopher columbus housing-development and remove all squatters and drug-dealers . thorne also argued successfully before the state supreme court that head start and similar preschool-programs should receive full state-funding . the office continues to represent head start in low-income-districts . community-leaders say they worry that the center 's specialized programs could be lost under a merger and that a new location will create confusion for clients . madden said his focus will be individual-cases , and that `` any resources we can spare to do community economic development , we will . '' congress created the legal-services corporation ( lsc ) in 1974 to improve low-income-residents ' access to the nation 's courts . in 1998 , two years after washington cut legal-aid-funding by a third or $ 122 million - state-programs started facing more rigorous requirements for grant-renewals , including achieving `` optimal-configuration of service-areas . '' earlier this year , legal-services of new jersey proposed-halving the number of its state-service-areas to seven , with passaic county 's program left intact . but the legal-services corp. in washington overruled that part of the plan . in submitting the state-plan , melville d. miller jr. , president of legal-services of new jersey , argued that the passaic county-office 's alleged-problems made it an undesirable-merger-partner . in a june letter to atlas , lsc president john n. erlenborn wrote that his decision was based in part on `` continuing-problems '' at the passaic county-office . a legal-services corp. audit in 1999 found 45 duplicate-case files in a random-sample of 400 cases . thorne acknowledged that his staff 's lack of familiarity with a new computer-system led to '' some '' duplicate-files , but said database-training and increased oversight by supervisors addressed the problem . atlas said reviewers also overstated-staff-turnover , arguing that many of the cited employees were short-term-workers . others left , for instance , to join private-practice or after failing to pass the state-bar , he said . `` we 'll be the first to admit we make mistakes , but most of those are bureaucratic . they do n't involve delivery of services , '' atlas said . he said state and federal-officials have failed to afford the agency a proper-hearing . legal-services corp. spokesman eric kleiman contended that atlas and his board `` have had ample-opportunity to make their case to us . '' in its suit , the passaic county-office asserts that the federal-agency 's executive-vice-president , randi youells , sought the merger in large part because of her personal-history with the office , which refused to hire her as a consultant in 1997 . kleiman called that charge `` completely-spurious .
