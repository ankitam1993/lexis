legal-services too crucial to take cut gerry l. alexander , chief-justice gerry l. alexander is chief-justice of the washington state supreme court . on feb. 14 , gov . gary locke issued an order cutting nearly-half the annual-state-funding for civil legal-services - $ 2.4 million -from the state-budget . already strained to the breaking-point , this cut will devastate the civil equal-justice-delivery system in our state . for the poor and vulnerable , the justice-system represents the place of last resort - the place where essential-rights are enforced and defended . for thousands upon thousands who need protection from domestic-abuse , wrongful-eviction or the improper denial or termination of essential governmental-assistance , our state 's civil legal-services-programs ( pro-bono legal-aid ) hold the key . if this budget-cut is left unmitigated , the governor 's action threatens irreparable-harm to truly-effective and important legal-services-programs . it is critical that the legislature correct this situation by replacing all or most of the amount-cut . i was a superior court judge in thurston county in 1980 . before me was a man with a toothless-smile . as i remember it , the state-department of social and health services had agreed to pay to pull his teeth out but , due to a budget-crisis , the department decided that it would not pay for the dentures that he needed . the man had no money and could not afford to hire a lawyer . however , a legal-services-lawyer from spokane filed a lawsuit challenging the department 's refusal to pay for the man 's dentures . i decided that the department had acted illegally . the man got his teeth . and in my view , justice was served . in 1980 , there were three primary legal-services-programs in our state . together they had a force of 130 attorneys and the responsibility to serve the civil legal-needs of about 550,000 poor and vulnerable-people throughout the state . there were legal-services-offices in 24 locations from walla walla to port angeles , from clarkston and colville to chehalis and longview , from seattle to spokane . in those days , the poor had a place to go , and they knew it . the picture is much-different today . the legal-services-programs that existed in 1980 are gone , gutted by two decades of budget-cuts , stagnant-funding and increasing-costs . in their place we have two statewide-providers of direct legal-assistance to poor and vulnerable-people . they operate with a third fewer attorneys and must try to meet the needs of a poverty-population that has doubled to nearly 1.2 million . while these attorneys are joined by thousands of volunteer-attorneys who last year contributed more than 27,000 hours of free legal-assistance , civil-justice is still unavailable for thousands who need it . the $ 2.4 million cut will cause irreversible-damage . most of us have no idea how many families and individuals are barely surviving . they are victims of domestic-violence , single moms trying to navigate the regulatory-maze that strangles their efforts to move from dependency to self-sufficiency , foster-children who are maltreated , migrant and seasonal-farm-workers who are not paid or are forced to work in unsafe and unsanitary conditions . there are so many needing-help , each with a compelling and sometimes life-and-death-story . until now , the legal-services-system has been able to support only an estimated 20 percent of those who need our help . it is unfathomable to think about the impact of further cuts . it is obvious that every social and human-service-budget will suffer from very painful-cuts as a result of the current-budget crisis . but legal-services are not just social-programs , they are justice-programs . legal-service-programs are the only solution for thousands of disenfranchised-washingtonians who need to assert and enforce their rights on matters of sheer-survival . and , given the weak-economy and the forthcoming-budget-cuts , these people need more help-right now , not less . every day-thousands of children in our state-recite the pledge of allegiance . the pledge ends with an affirmation of the essential promise of our democracy - `` with liberty and justice for all . '' the u.s. supreme court building is carved with the words `` equal-justice under law . '' people in every corner of the world-fight and die for the american-ideal of equal-justice . but does equal-justice exist only for those with means to petition the courts ? can equal-justice exist where the laws can not be enforced because the poor can not secure-counsel ? each time a poor-person is denied-access to the justice-system - to assert or defend important legal-rights - a small-piece of our democracy dies . in november 2001 , the washington state supreme court created the task-force on civil equal-justice funding , with 19 representatives of the judiciary , the legislature and the governor 's office . this task-force is committed to solving the problem of adequately funding-access to civil-justice in this state . formed three months before anyone knew the depth of the state-budget-cuts , we admittedly are alarmed . how can we resuscitate an already-sick system while enduring even deeper cuts ? the legislature needs to do the right-thing for the people of this state . it must act to replace all or most of the $ 2.4 million cut from legal-services . it is our duty as a democratic-society - and as compassionate-leaders in the state of washington - to make sure that we really do ensure justice for all .
