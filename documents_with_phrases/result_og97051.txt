office of the general counsel b-277228 june 24 , 1997 the honorable james m. jeffords chairman the honorable edward m. kennedy ranking minority member committee on labor and human-resources united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : department of health and human-services , food and drug administration : substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed ; animal-proteins prohibited in ruminant-feed pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the department of health and human-services , food and drug administration ( fda ) , entitled `` substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed ; animal-proteins prohibited in ruminant-feed '' ( rin : 0910-aa91 ) . we received the rule on june 10 , 1997 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on june 5 , 1997 . 62 fed . reg . 30936 . fda is issuing this rule to reduce the risk of an outbreak of transmissible-spongiform-encephalopathy ( tse ) in the united states . in the united kingdom , one form of tse , bovine-spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , is believed to be linked to cattle feed containing rendered-protein-by-products from sheep and goats infected with scrapie , a disease related to bse . fda suggests there may be an association between bse and a form of human tse known as new variant creutzfeldt-jakob-disease . bse has not been diagnosed in the united states . this rule is intended to prevent the establishment and amplification of bse in the united states through feed and , thereby , to minimize the risk to animals and humans . gao/ogc-97-51 this rule-amends fda regulations to provide that animal-protein derived from mammalian-tissues for use in ruminant-feed is a food additive-subject to certain-provisions in the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( 21 u.s.c . §§ 301 et seq. ) . fda is taking this action because ruminants are being fed protein derived from animals in which tse has been found and such proteins may cause tse in ruminants . enclosed is our assessment of fda 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that fda complied with the applicable-requirements . if you have any questions about this report , please contact kathleen wannisky , associate general counsel for operations , at ( 202 ) 512-5207 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the department of health and human-services , food and drug administration is robert robinson , director , food and agriculture issues . mr. robinson can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-5138 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : the honorable donna e. shalala secretary of health and human-services page 2 gao/ogc-97-51 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the department of health and human-services , food and drug administration entitled `` substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed ; animal-proteins prohibited in ruminant-feed '' ( rin : 0910-aa91 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis in the preamble to the rule , fda presents a summary of its economic-analyses , discussing the potential-benefits of the proposed-rule and the economic-impact that could occur as a result of its implementation . full-texts of both the cost-analysis and an addendum were provided to gao at the time-the-agency filed the rule with us . in accordance with executive-order 12866 , the analyses describe the regulatory-options available to reduce the risk of an outbreak of bse in the united states and the costs and benefits associated with each option . fda estimates the direct-compliance-costs of the rule will be about $ 44.3 million per year and that the initial-value of the affected-meat and bone-meal will be reduced by $ 171 million annually . in contrast , nonruminant-animal-producers may gain up to $ 162 million in lower feed-costs . fda estimates that the aggregated net annualized-costs of the rule , accounting for both losses and gains , will total $ 52.9 million . the primary-benefit of this rule , as described in the economic-analyses , is the costs that would be averted by reducing the risk of bse becoming established and proliferating in the united states through feed . fda stated that it could not quantify the costs of all the benefits associated with this rule , such as the value of human-lives saved or the medical-costs that would be avoided by preventing an outbreak of bse . however , it did provide estimates of some of the costs that might be incurred if the rule were not implemented and an outbreak of bse were to occur in the united states . fda estimates that costs of $ 93 million would be incurred in direct-livestock-losses due to bse infection , that costs of $ 4.7 billion would be incurred slaughtering at-risk-cattle culled to prevent bse spread , and that costs of $ 593 million would be incurred imposing-feed-regulations at the time bse was detected . gao/ogc-97-51 ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 on january 3 , 1997 , fda published a summary of its initial regulatory-impact-analysis in the preamble to the proposed-rule ( 62 fed . reg . 552 at 572 ) . fda concluded that the rule will have a significant impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . the vast majority of entities involved in ruminant-production and meat preparation are considered small businesses according to size-standards set by the small business-administration . the analysis also discusses the regulatory-alternatives fda considered in drafting the proposed-rule . fda published a summary of its final regulatory-flexibility-analysis in the preamble to the final-rule published on june 5 , 1997 ( 62 fed . reg . 30936 at 30966 ) . in that analysis fda discusses the need for the rule , the benefits anticipated from the implementation of the rule , and a summary of the impacts of the final-rule . the preamble summarizes the issues raised by the public-comments to the proposed-rule , describes the numbers of small-entities affected by the rule , and describes the recordkeeping-burden of the rule . the preamble also describes the seven alternatives considered by fda in promulgating this rule and why it believes that the alternative selected ( the mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition -- with exceptions ) is the most cost-effective regulatory-alternative that meets the objective of the agency . fda also points out that it revised the rule in several-respects to decrease the burden on small-entities in response to comments received from small businesses . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 fda determined that , because this rule imposes no mandates on government-entities and will result in expenditures of less that $ 100,000,000 in any one year , that no further analysis is needed under the unfunded-mandates reform act . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . this rule was published as a notice of proposed-rulemaking on january 3 , 1997 ( 62 fed . reg . 552 ) under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . based on the numerous-comments it received , fda published the codified-provisions of the draft final-rule on april 17 , 1997 ( 62 fed . reg . 18728 ) and provided an opportunity for the public to comment . fda made some changes to the draft-language based on those comments and published the final-rule on june 5 , 1997 ( 62 fed . reg . 30936 ) . the preamble to the final-rule discusses the comments received and the actions taken upon them . page 2 gao/ogc-97-51 paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 this final-rule contains information-collection-requirements which are subject to the paperwork reduction act . fda submitted the information-collection-request to omb for approval at the time the proposed-rule was published ( january 3 , 1997 ) . omb did not approve the information-collection as submitted , but required fda to invite comments on the information-collection when the final-rule was published . after fda evaluates the comments received , makes any revisions , and receives final omb-approval for the information-collection , fda will announce in the federal register that approval and the effective-date of the part of the regulations that relate to the information-collection . executive-order 12866 this final-rule is considered to be an `` economically-significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order 12866 . in accordance with the provisions of the executive-order , fda assessed the costs and benefits of regulatory-alternatives and appears to have selected the approach that maximizes net-benefits while still meeting-agency objectives . executive-order 12612 fda states that it has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles set forth in executive-order 12612 , federalism , and has determined that the rule does not warrant the preparation of a federalism-assessment . statutory-authorization for the rule fda cites sections 201 , 402 , 403 , 409 , and 701 of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( 21 u.s.c . §§ 321 , 342 , 343 , 348 , and 721 ) as statutory-authority for this rule . page 3 gao/ogc-97-51
