legal-services for poor facing statewide-cuts saturday , october 5 , 2002 louisville , ky. ( ap ) - the loss of $ 1.36 million could mean the state 's legal-services for the poor will lose six of their 21 regional-offices , the head of a poverty-law-resource-center said . it could also mean the loss of some of the 72 lawyers in kentucky for the program commonly called `` legal-aid , '' as well as legal-assistants and other staff . `` this is a major-funding-crisis for legal-aid throughout the state , '' said jamie hamon , executive director of the access to justice foundation , a statewide poverty-law-resource-center in lexington . legal-aid provides noncriminal legal-assistance to the poor in areas such as family-law , consumer-fraud , housing-evictions and foreclosures . statewide , legal-aid will lose about $ 800,000 in federal-funds - a cut of about 13 percent from the $ 6 million it got this year from the federal legal-services corp. , which provides most of the money for legal-aid . the state also is facing the loss of about $ 460,000 - nearly all the grant-money it gets through the federal-violence against women act - for legal-services for poor-women who suffer domestic-violence . in addition , because of lower interest rates , it is facing a decline of about $ 100,000 in funds from interest collected on lawyers ' trust-accounts . hamon said directors of kentucky 's four legal-aid-programs still are reviewing the cuts . scott crocker , executive director of kentucky legal-aid , which serves western and southern kentucky , said his office will lose about $ 260,000 out of a budget of about $ 2.2 million . all of the agency 's clients are poor , and many are elderly or disabled , he said . the louisville region is facing the potential-loss of three or four staff-members because of the cuts , said dennis bricking , executive director of the louisville legal-aid society , which serves jefferson and 14 surrounding-counties . the cuts will come at a time when the demand for services is increasing . bricking said he expects to lose about $ 170,000 out of an annual-budget of about $ 3 million . hamon said legal-aid-offices are forced to prioritize cases . for example , they are more likely to take on eviction-cases or domestic-violence-cases if there are children involved and foreclosure-cases when an elderly-person has been the victim of fraud and risks losing a home . unless congress increases funding , kentucky will lose about $ 800,000 in 2003 from the federal-program that supports legal-aid because funds are tied to each state 's poverty-rate . kentucky's poverty-rate declined about 3 percent under the latest census-data . states like kentucky where poverty declined slightly suffered cuts because other large-states had significant-increases in poverty and will drain additional federal-money from the legal-services fund , hamon said . an amendment to a senate appropriations-bill offered by sen. tom harkin , d-iowa , that would increase federal legal-aid-funding is pending , but its passage is uncertain , bricking said . legal-aid-officials are particularly-worried about impoverished areas of the state , such as eastern kentucky , served by the appalachian research and defense fund , or appalred . `` what you 've got is poor-people with acute legal-needs not being able to have those needs met , '' said ernie lewis , head of the state public-defender-system and a board member of appalred . `` i think each board and each executive director are going to have to reduce services for poor-people . '' he said he expects appalred to see a $ 600,000 cut in its $ 4 million budget . legal-aid of the bluegrass , which serves the lexington area and northern kentucky , could not be reached for an estimate on its cuts . next year , kentucky will lose almost $ 500,000 in grants through the federal-violence against women act used to provide legal-assistance to poor-women who are victims of domestic-violence . the u.s. justice department declined to renew those grants under new policies that direct the money to start-up programs instead of funding existing-programs , hamon said .
