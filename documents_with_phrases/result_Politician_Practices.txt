a politician practices what he professes gene r. nichol sunday , december 29 , 2002 chapel hill -- there must be something different about former georgia governors . i was never crazy about jimmy carter while he was president . but since he left-office , he has led like none other . whether by swinging his solo-hammer or by standing for peace against the epithets of the world , carter has become the first american . some shine best as citizens . soon , the world will be treated to a brand new ex-georgia governor . democrat roy barnes was upset in november by sonny perdue . i had the misfortune of watching one of the barnes-perdue debates on c-span . sonny did n't know much . but he knew barnes had tried to do something about the confederate symbol on the georgia flag . trent lott must have been moved . so now barnes , too , will `` retire '' into citizenship . the patterns , of course , are well established . former-governors , senators , majority-leaders and the like can expect a cascade of lucrative-offers . law-firms fight for their names and contacts . lobbying-outfits roll out a carpet of gold . and roy barnes has an added benefit . he is apparently a skilled lawyer -- having built a hugely successful-trial-practice in marietta before running for governor . the georgia papers have speculated that barnes could go to work for any number of silk-stocking atlanta firms for a seven-figure-salary . so it is perhaps-understandable that steven gottlieb , executive director of the atlanta legal-aid society , initially thought it was a joke when he received a phone-message from governor barnes saying he 'd like to go to work as a legal-services-lawyer . `` i 've never heard of a former-governor going to work for a legal-aid-program , '' said gottlieb . but it was no joke . barnes has confirmed that he 'll join the non-profit-group for six months , donating his time and considerable skills to handling the legal-cases of lowincome-georgians . `` holding elective-office , '' he explained , `` is not the only way to help others . '' barnes wo n't-lack for clients . last year , atlanta legal-aid handled over 20,000 cases -- representing aids patients , domestic-violence-victims , desperate-mothers seeking-child-support , elderly homeowners fleeced by lenders and the like . but due to the federal-budget-cuts of the past 25 years , the office was forced to turn away many thousands more . georgia is a lot like the rest of the country . huge-percentages of the population are priced out of the legal-system . so barnes ' remarkable-decision swims against the tide on two fronts . first , as one astonished consultant put it , `` it's refreshing to see someone leave political-office and not cash in . '' and , second , as a leader of the legal-community , barnes seems to have decided that an unfulfilled rhetorical-pledge to legal equality is n't enough . for generations , we have we have declared , as a cornerstone of constitutional-government , that `` there can be no equal-justice where the kind of trial a person gets depends on the amount of money he has . '' but study after study shows that about 80 percent of the legal-needs of the poor in the united states are unmet . the figure is almost as bleak for middle -income americans . yet , unlike many industrial-nations , we 've recognized no general right to representation in civil-cases . less than 1 percent of our total-expenditure for lawyers goes to service for the poor . most lawyers do no pro-bono-work at all . recent-affluence has eroded rather than expanded support for such programs . over the past decade , the average-revenue of the country 's most successful-firms increased by over 50 percent , and their pro-bono-work dropped by a third . we carve `` equal-justice under law '' on our courthouse-walls . but that 's about as far as the sentiment goes . it is true , i 'll concede , that roy barnes has only committed half a year to the georgia legal-services-program , not the rest of his life . and he is already a wealthy-man , so it 's not exactly the same thing as a young-lawyer going to work for exceedingly-modest wages . but one of the perplexing-rituals of american-politics is listening to candidate after candidate explain that he runs for office because he is driven to `` represent the interests of ordinary americans . '' we accept these claims even though we know the candidate has never spent a moment representing the powerless before the campaign began , and that it would never even occur to him to be bothered with such matters once the election is over . besides , even if it 's just for six months , barnes has made it clear he 'll roll up his sleeves and be a real legal-aid-lawyer . he 'll be trying-cases , day after day . no staff . no prepared-papers . no scripted-presentations . no assistants toting his bags . just a daunting-caseload and beleaguered , frightened-clients . standing shoulder to shoulder with those who have no one else to speak for them . carrying out the highest aspirations of both the legal-profession and the american-democracy . i love jimmy carter . i 'm starting to feel the same way about roy barnes .
