lindsay 's legacy nonprofits honor the retired-attorney and volunteer for his dedication to social-justice . by mary carr mayle safe shelter executive director gail reese-wheeler vividly recalls her first encounter with jim lindsay 's indomitable spirit . it was nine years ago and reese-wheeler was barely into her second week with the shelter when lindsay , a safe shelter board member , invited her to lunch to talk about `` some ideas he had for the shelter . '' `` jim had so much-vision and enthusiasm , '' reese-wheeler says . `` by the end of that one-hour-lunch , he had listed off at least 20 projects - not the least of which was a new shelter -- and was sitting there waiting for me to respond . `` he scared me to death , until i began to realize that jim lindsay was the kind of man who would roll up his shirtsleeves and work-right beside you . '' on thursday , lindsay got his first look at one of his most fervent-hopes come true -- a new home for safe shelter . as his son , ken , wheels him up the concrete-ramp and through the doors , lindsey 's grin says it all . `` i 'm amazed . i had hoped this would happen , but i never dreamed it would be so soon or so grand , '' he says with difficulty , picking his words carefully . lindsay , who has suffered several-strokes and moved with his wife , shirley , to an assisted-care-community in jacksonville , fla. was back in town for `` jim lindsay day , '' which included a tour of the shelter and a reception attended by many of the people whose lives he touched as a volunteer with savannah nonprofits . lou barnes first met lindsay when he served on the board of parent and child development services , where she was the human-resources manager . later , they both served on the safe shelter board . `` i would n't have missed this day for anything , '' barnes says . `` jim is such a giving-person , so committed to helping those less fortunate . i 've seen very few men as dedicated to community volunteerism as jim . yes , he was retired and had the time , but he could have just as easily spent that time on the golf-course . jim is one who has always given as generously of his time as he did his money . '' a retired corporate-lawyer , lindsay entered oberlin college at 14 , then went on to law-school at the university of michigan . daughter pippi ellison , who flew down from boston for the celebration , says her father 's passion for social-justice `` has always been there . '' `` from very early on , i learned that there were people in circumstances very different from ours and that ignoring those people was not an option , '' ellison says . `` my father was always working for fair- and low-income-housing . when the family lived in new york , ellison says , her father got the whole-family involved in the new york city mission society , passing on the exclusive-summer-camps to send his children to the society 's camp for inner-city-kids . `` i was a camper and my older sister and brother were counselors . it was education through immersion , '' says ellison , who works as a clinical-psychologist near boston . meeting jim lindsay was an education of a different-sort for bill broker of georgia legal-services . `` this was back when we were on the second floor of the urban health center on york street and i had been managing-attorney for only a year or two , '' broker recalls . `` in strolls jim lindsay , saying he 's a retired-lawyer now living in savannah and he was interested in doing free legal-work for poor-people . `` he really shook up my whole-mindset , '' broker says . `` i was so focused on bringing in new young-lawyers right out of school because that was what we could afford . it never occurred to me that there might be older , experienced-attorneys out there willing to help . '' it was lindsay , broker says , who first broached the idea of having a senior volunteer-attorney program , which is flourishing today . lindsay helped out at georgia legal-services by working on benefits-cases , such as social-security and medicaid claims . he and broker later began the mediation center in savannah , with both serving on the nonprofit 's first board . but , perhaps lindsay 's biggest contribution to georgia legal-services was the inspiration he provided its young-lawyers . `` jim sat in on our weekly-meetings , listening to people talk about their cases , '' broker says . `` he had such a depth of understanding , a maturity of judgment and an uncanny-ability to hone in on the real-issues . `` just to hear him say , 'i believe in what you 're doing , ' raised our game and made us want to work harder . `` i think that 's the kind of effect jim lindsay has on everyone he touches .
