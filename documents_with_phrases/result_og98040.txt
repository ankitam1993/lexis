( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 , and 609 an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis and a final regulatory-flexibility-analysis were prepared for both rules and were summarized in the preambles to the proposed and final-rules , respectively . the complete-analyses were furnished to our office . the analyses contain the information required by the regulatory-flexibility-act . the final-analysis for the registration-form rule notes that of the approximately 2,700 registered open-end management investment companies , approximately 620 or gao/ogc-98-40 23 percent are funds which meet the definition of small-entities with net-assets of $ 50 million or less at the end of the most recent fiscal year . the analysis concludes that the final-rule will not impose any additional-burdens on small-entities because most of the changes in the rule do not require the development of new information . the rule will primarily require a reformatting of the current-information , which may take longer the initial-time it is performed but will possibly result in less time in the future for preparing the new format . while it considered several-alternatives to reduce to the burden on small-entities , the sec found that separate-treatment for small-entities would not be consistent with the protection of investors . concerning the new disclosure option rule , the final-analysis notes that approximately-one-third of the 620 small-entities could choose to use the new profile or 207 funds . the analysis finds that the new rule would not be significantly burdensome for small-entities because use of the profile is optional and that the information contained in the profile is now typically contained a fund 's prospectus . as above , while several-alternatives were considered , the sec found that it was unnecessary or inappropriate to adopt any of them because of the need for investor-protection .
