valley needing legal-services mcallen ( ap ) - the consolidation of legal-services-agencies for the poor may improve efficiency , but wo n't increase the number of clients served , a rural legal-specialist in south texas says . david hall , director of texas rural legal-aid in weslaco , said legal-services for the poor in the rio grande valley are inadequate and need a dramatic-increase in funding . `` we 've got one lawyer for every 30,000 poor-people in the valley , '' hall said in sunday 's editions of the monitor ( mcallen ) . as part of a nationwide-overhaul of legal-services corp. to get more poor-people legal-help , nine legal-aid-groups in texas are being folded into three , creating-mega-programs involving-dozens of counties across thousands of miles . john mckay , president of the organization , said the refocused and larger programs can raise more money , find more lawyers and increase the number of poor-people who get help through the civil courts-system . the programs , supplemented by funding from state-governments , bar-associations and foundations , provide free legal-help to the poor but not in criminal-cases . but hall said what 's needed is more money . he said his group takes on about 10,000 cases per year with a staff of eight or nine attorneys . of the $ 329 million appropriated by congress to legal-services corp. this year , the valley receives about $ 15 million to $ 20 million and employs about 37-staff-lawyers . organizations that provide free or `` pro-bono '' services are able to maintain a better lawyer-to-client-ratio because they often specialize in particular kinds of cases , hall said . even accounting for pro-bono-work , as much as 90 percent of the legal-needs of the poor go unmet , according to bill underwood , a law-professor at baylor university . `` if every lawyer in the state of texas was doing pro-bono-work , then that still would n't be enough , '' he said . underwood said one lawyer working-full-time for a legal-services group can accomplish as much as 20 lawyers doing part-time pro-bono-work on a similar-case . `` the problem is , there 's never been adequate public-funding , '' he said . but ken boehm , a former-counsel to the lsc board said a lack of funding for the federal lsc program is not the problem , it needs reform
