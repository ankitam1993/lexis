supreme court of the united states syllabus legal-services corporation v. velazquez et al . certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit no . 99-603 . argued october 4 , 2000- decided february 28 , 2001* the legal-services corporation act authorizes petitioner legal-services corporation ( lsc ) to distribute funds appropriated by congress to local-grantee-organizations providing free legal-assistance to indigent-clients in , inter-alia , welfare-benefits claims . in every annual-appropriations-act since 1996 , congress has prohibited lsc-funding of any organization that represented-clients in an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing-welfare-law . grantees can not continue representation in a welfare-matter even where a constitutional or statutory-validity-challenge becomes apparent after representation is well under way . respondents- lawyers employed by lsc grantees , together with others- filed-suit to declare , inter-alia , the restriction-invalid . the district-court denied them a preliminary-injunction , but the second circuit invalidated the restriction , finding it impermissible-viewpoint-discrimination that violated the first amendment . held : the funding-restriction violates the first amendment . pp . 5-15 . ( a ) lsc and the government , also a petitioner , claim that rust v. sullivan , 500 u. s. 173 , in which this court upheld a restriction prohibiting-doctors employed by federally funded family-planning clinics from discussing-abortion with their patients , supports the restriction here . however , the court has since explained that the rust counseling-activities amounted to governmental-speech , sustaining-view -- -- -- * together with no . 99-960 , united states v. velazquez et al. , also on certiorari to the same court . legal-services corporation v. velazquez syllabus point-based-funding-decisions in instances in which the government is itself the speaker , see board of regents of univ . of wis. system v. southworth , 529 u. s. 217 , 229 , 235 , or instances , like rust , in which the government uses private-speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program , rosenberger v. rector and visitors of univ . of va. , 515 u. s. 819 , 833 . although the government has the latitude to ensure that its own message is being delivered , neither that latitude nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private-speech in every instance . like the rosenberger-program , the lsc program was designed to facilitate private-speech , not to promote a governmental-message . an lsc-attorney speaks on behalf of a private , indigent-client in a welfare-benefits claim , while the government 's message is delivered by the attorney defending the benefits-decision . the attorney's advice to the client and advocacy to the courts can not be classified as governmental-speech even under a generous-understanding of that concept . in this vital-respect this suit is distinguishable from rust . pp . 5-8 . ( b ) the private-nature of the instant-speech , and the extent of lsc 's regulation of private-expression , are indicated further by the circumstance that the government seeks to control an existing-medium of expression in ways which distort its usual-functioning . cases involving a limited-forum , though not controlling , provide instruction for evaluating-restrictions in governmental-subsidies . here the program presumes that private , nongovernmental-speech is necessary , and a substantial-restriction is placed upon that speech . by providing-subsidies to lsc , the government seeks to facilitate suits for benefits by using the state and federal judiciaries and the independent-bar on which they depend for the proper-performance of their duties and responsibilities . restricting lsc-attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting-arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal-system by altering the attorneys ' traditional-role in much the same way broadcast-systems or student-publication-networks were changed in the limited-forum-cases of arkansas ed . television comm'n v. forbes , 523 u. s. 666 , and rosenberger v. rector and visitors of univ . of va. , supra . the government may not design a subsidy to effect such a serious and fundamental-restriction on the advocacy of attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary . an informed , independent-judiciary presumes an informed , independent-bar . however , the instant-restriction prevents lsc-attorneys from advising the courts of serious statutory-validity-questions . it also threatens severe-impairment of the judicial-function by sifting out cases presenting constitutional-challenges in order to insulate the government 's laws from judicial-inquiry . the result of this restriction would be two tiers of cases . there would be lingering-doubt cite as : 531 u. s. ____ ( 2001 ) syllabus whether an lsc-attorney 's truncated-representation had resulted in complete-analysis of the case , full-advice to the client , and proper-presentation to the court ; and the courts and the public would come to question the adequacy and fairness of professional-representations when the attorney avoided all reference to statutory-validity and constitutional-authority-questions . a scheme so inconsistent with accepted separation-of-powers-principles is an insufficient-basis to sustain or uphold the restriction on speech . pp . 8-12 . ( c ) that lsc-attorneys can withdraw does not make the restrictionharmless , for the statute is an attempt to draw lines around the lsc program to exclude from litigation-arguments and theories congress finds unacceptable but which by their nature are within the courts ' province to consider . the restriction is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws , the indigent-client is unlikely to find other counsel . there may be no alternative-source of vital-information on the client's constitutional or statutory-rights , in stark-contrast to rust , where a patient could receive both governmentally subsidized counseling and consultation with independent or affiliate organizations . finally , notwithstanding congress ' purpose to confine and limit its program , the restriction insulates current-welfare-laws from constitutional-scrutiny and certain other legal-challenges , a condition implicating central first amendment concerns . there can be little-doubt that the lsc act funds constitutionally protected expression ; and there is no programmatic-message of the kind recognized in rust and which sufficed there to allow the government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate-objectives . pp . 12-14 . ( d ) the court of appeals concluded that the funding-restriction could be severed from the statute , leaving the remaining-portions-operative . because that determination was not contested here , the court in the exercise of its discretion and prudential-judgment-declines to address it . pp . 14-15 . 164 f. 3d 757 , affirmed . kennedy , j. , delivered the opinion of the court , in which stevens , souter , ginsburg , and breyer , jj. , joined . scalia , j. , filed a dissenting-opinion in which rehnquist , c. j. , and o'connor and thomas , jj. , joined .
