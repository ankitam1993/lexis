( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 epa has determined that the final-rule will not have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . the automobile-manufacturers regulated by the rule do not qualify as small-entities within the meaning of the regulatory-flexibility-act . therefore , neither an initial nor final regulatory-flexibility-analysis was performed . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 based on the cost-benefit-analysis performed by epa , the rule will not impose an intergovernmental-mandate because there are no enforceable-duties on state , local gao/ogc-96-42 or tribal-governments . however , the rule will impose a mandate on the private sector in excess of $ 100 million in any one year . epa has prepared both a qualitative and quantitative-assessment of the benefits and costs of the rule in the regulatory-impact-analysis . epa has considered numerous regulatory-alternatives to the final provisions of the rule , which are discussed in both the preamble to the final-rule and the regulatory-impact-analysis , but has determined that the requirements expressed in the final-rule constitute the most cost-effective and least burdensome-alternative that would meet the mandate of section 206 ( h ) of the clean-air act . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . instead of the notice and comment procedures in the administrative procedure act , the epa promulgated this rule using the procedures , which have similar-notice and comment-requirements , contained in section 307 ( d ) of the clean-air act , as amended . ( 42 u.s.c . § 7607 ( d ) ) . the use of these procedures regarding-rules pertaining to the promulgation or revision of regulations and test-procedures for new motor-vehicles or engines is mandated by section 307 ( d ) ( 1 ) ( k ) of the clean-air act . epa published a notice of proposed-rulemaking on february 7 , 1995 ( 60 fed . reg . 7404 ) , and conducted a public-hearing on april 19 and 20 , 1995 on the proposed-rule . the comment-period was to close on may 22 , 1995 , but was extended until july 19 , 1995 , because additional-time was necessary to gather and analyze data relating to the rule . the preamble also notes ( 61 fed . reg . 54853 ) that additional-comments , data and analyses were received after the close of the comment-period and that the epa considered such information in developing-test-procedures , cost-estimates and lead-time . section 307 ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) ( i ) permits epa to put documents in the rulemaking-docket after the comment-period is over . this type of addition to the record after the close of the comment-period and the need to reopen the comment-period are discussed in sierra club v. costle ( 657 f. 2d 298 at 392-400 ( 1981 ) ) , where the court held such action was not required because there was adequate-time for response . we have been advised by epa that the additional-comments and data were added to the public-docket between august and december 1995 and therefore at least 6 months was available for responses or objections to be filed . the preamble to the final-rule discusses the comments received and any action taken as a result of the comments . page 2 gao/ogc-96-42 paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the rule contains information-collection-requirements which are subject to the paperwork reduction act . epa has submitted an information-collection-request ( icr ) document to the office of management and budget for approval . the icr contains the information required by the act including the reasons for the collection of the information , the type of information and an estimate of the burden imposed on respondents . the burden of the requirement ( testing , recordkeeping and reporting-requirements ) is estimated to average 566 hours annually for a typical-manufacturer . epa has solicited-comments on the proposed information-collection-requirements to be sent to both epa and omb for consideration during the approval-process . the information-collection-requirements will not be effective until omb-approval is obtained . statutory-authorization for the rule the epa has cited sections 202 , 206 , 208 and 301 of the clean-air act , as amended . ( 42 u.s.c . §§ 7521 , 7525 , 7542 and 7601 ) . in particular , section 206 ( h ) of the act ( 42 u.s.c . § 7525 ( h ) ) requires the administrator of the epa to review and revise the regulations regarding the testing of motor-vehicles and motor-vehicle engines to insure that vehicles are tested under circumstances which reflect the actual-driving-conditions under which motor-vehicles are used , including-conditions relating to fuel , temperature , acceleration and altitude . executive-order no . 12866 omb reviewed the rule under executive-order no . 12866 as a '' significant regulatory-action . '' the office of information and regulatory affairs of omb approved the final-rule as complying with the requirements of the order based on the information supplied by epa , including a planned regulatory-action-document describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary-impact of the rule . in its submission , epa did not identify any other statute or executive-order imposing procedural-requirements relevant to the final-rule . page 3 gao/ogc-96-42
