d.c. 20548 july 15 , 2002 the honorable daniel akaka chairman the honorable james inhofe ranking minority member subcommittee on readiness and management-support committee on armed-services united states senate as you requested , this report examines how best-practices offer improvements to the way the department of defense develops new weapon-systems , primarily the design and manufacturing-aspects of the acquisition-process . it examines the attainment of design and manufacturing-knowledge and its use at critical-junctures to make decisions about weapon-systems ' readiness to move forward in the acquisition-process . we make recommendations to the secretary of defense for improvements to weapon-system acquisition-policy to better align design and manufacturing-activities with best-practices that have shown that the capture and use of key-knowledge can result in better cost , schedule , and performance-outcomes . we are sending-copies of this report to the secretary of defense ; the secretary of the army ; the secretary of the navy ; the secretary of the air force ; the director of the office of management and budget ; the director , missile defense agency ; and interested congressional-committees . we will also make copies available to others upon request . in addition , the report will be available at no charge on the gao web site at http : //www.gao.gov . if you have any questions regarding this report , please call me at ( 202 ) 512-4841 . other contacts are listed in appendix ii . katherine v. schinasi director acquisition and sourcing management-executive summary historically , the department of defense ( dod ) has taken much longer and purpose spent much more than originally planned to develop and acquire its weapon-systems , significantly reducing the department 's buying-power over the years . clearly , it is critical to find better ways of doing business and , in particular , to make sure that weapon-systems are delivered on time and cost-effectively . this is especially-true given the vast-sums dod is spending and is expected to spend on weapons acquisition- $ 100 billion alone in 2002 and an anticipated $ 700 billion over the next 5 years . dod has recognized the nature of this problem and has taken steps to address it , including advocating the use of best-practices for product development from commercial-companies . leading-commercial companies have achieved more predictable-outcomes from their product-development-processes because they identify and control-design and manufacturing-risks early and manage them effectively . while dod has made some progress in recent years , gao 's recent-weapon-system reviews show that persistent-problems continue to hinder acquisition-cost , schedule , and performance-outcomes . for this reason , gao has continued a body of work to identify the lessons learned by best commercial-companies to see if they apply to weapon-system-acquisitions . this report addresses how dod can manage its weapon-system acquisition-process to ensure important-knowledge about a system's design , critical-manufacturing-processes , and reliability is captured and used to make informed and timely-decisions before committing to substantial-development and production-investments . it identifies best-practices to facilitate this decision-making at two critical-junctures-transition from system-integration to system-demonstration during product development and then transition into production . ultimately , this should improve cost , schedule , and quality-outcomes of dod major-weapon-system acquisitions . in response to a request from the chairman and the ranking minority member , subcommittee on readiness and management-support , senate committee on armed-services , gao ( 1 ) assessed the impact of design and manufacturing-knowledge on dod program-outcomes , ( 2 ) compared best-practices to those used in dod-programs , and ( 3 ) analyzed current weapon-system acquisition-guidance for applicability of best-practices to obtain better program-outcomes . background executive-summary in any new product-development-program there are three critical points that require the capture of specific-knowledge to achieve successful-outcomes . the first knowledge-point occurs when the customer 's requirements are clearly defined and resources-proven technology , design , time , and money-exist to satisfy them . commercial-companies insist that technology be mature at the outset of a product-development-program and , therefore , separate-technology development from product development . the second knowledge-point is achieved when the product 's design is determined to be capable of meeting product requirements-the design is stable and ready to begin initial-manufacturing of prototypes . the third-knowledge-point is achieved when a reliable-product can be produced repeatedly within established cost , schedule , and quality-targets . gao 's prior-work on best-practices covers achieving the first knowledge point.1 this report examines best-practices for achieving the second and third-knowledge-points . commercial-companies understand the importance of capturing-design and manufacturing-knowledge early in product development , when costs to identify problems and make design-changes to the product are significantly cheaper . in a knowledge-based-process , the achievement of each successive-knowledge-point builds on the preceding one , giving-decision-makers the knowledge they need-when they need it-to make decisions about whether to invest significant additional-funds to move forward with product development . programs that follow a knowledge-based-approach typically have a higher probability of successful-cost and schedule-outcomes . problems occur in programs when knowledge builds more slowly than commitments to enter product development or production . the effects of this delay in capturing-knowledge can be debilitating . if a decision is made to commit to develop and produce a design before the critical-technology , design , or manufacturing-knowledge is captured , problems will cascade and become magnified through the product development and production-phases . outcomes from these problems include increases in cost and schedule and degradations in performance and quality . 1 u.s. general-accounting-office , best-practices : better matching of needs and resources will lead to better weapon-system outcomes , gao-01-288 ( washington , d.c. : mar . 8 , 2001 ) and best-practices : better management of technology-development can improve weapon-system outcomes , gao/nsiad-99-162 ( washington , d.c. : july 30 , 1999 ) . page 3 gao-02-701 best-practices the success of any effort to develop a new product hinges on having the results in brief right-knowledge at the right-time . knowledge about a product's design and producibility-facilitates informed-decisions about whether to significantly increase investments and reduces the risk of costly-design-changes later in the program . every program eventually achieves this knowledge ; however , leading-commercial companies gao visited have found that there is a much better opportunity to meet predicted cost , schedule , and quality-targets when it is captured early , in preparation for critical-investment decisions . a product-development-process includes two phases followed by production-integration-phase and demonstration-phase . the commercial-companies gao visited achieved success in product development by first achieving a mature , stable-design supported by completed engineering-drawings during an integration-phase and then by demonstrating that the product 's design was reliable and critical-manufacturing-processes required to build it were in control before committing to full-production . the more successful dod-programs gao reviewed-the aim-9x and the fa-18-e/f programs-had achieved similar-knowledge as the commercial-companies , resulting in good-cost and schedule-outcomes . in contrast , the dod-programs , which had completed about one-quarter of their drawings when they transitioned to the demonstration-phase and had less than half of their manufacturing-processes in control when entering-production , experienced poor-cost and schedule-outcomes . leading-commercial companies employed practices to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge in time for making-key decisions during product development . two were most prominent . first , the companies kept the degree of the design-challenge manageable before starting a new product-development-program by using an evolutionary-approach to develop a product . this minimized the amount of new content and technologies on a product , making it easier to capture the requisite-knowledge about a product 's design before investing in manufacturing-processes , tooling , and facilities . second , the companies captured design and manufacturing-knowledge before the two critical-decision-points in product development : when the design was demonstrated to be stable-the second knowledge-point-and when the product was demonstrated to be producible at an affordable cost-the third-knowledge-point . a key-measure of design-stability was stakeholders ' agreements that engineering-drawings were complete and supported by testing and prototyping when necessary . a key-measure of producibility was whether the companies ' critical-manufacturing-processes were in control and product-reliability was demonstrated . most dod-programs gao reviewed did not complete engineering-drawings prior to entering the demonstration-phase , nor did they bring critical-manufacturing-processes in control or demonstrate reliability prior to making a production-decision . dod has made changes to its acquisition-policy2 in an attempt to improve its framework for developing-weapon-systems , but the policy does not require the capture of design or manufacturing-knowledge or sufficient-criteria to enter the system-demonstration and production-phases . in addition , it does not require a decision-review to enter the demonstration-phase of product development . further , there is little-incentive for dod program-managers to capture knowledge early in the development-process . instead , the acquisition-environment emphasizes delaying-knowledge-capture and problem-identification since these events can have a negative influence on obtaining annual-program funding-a key to success for dod managers . in contrast , commercial-companies encourage their managers to capture product-design and manufacturing-knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development , before making significant-increases in their investment . gao is making-recommendations to the secretary of defense on ways to improve dod 's acquisition-process to achieve better outcomes by incorporating best-practices to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge and then use this knowledge as a basis for decisions to commit significant additional-time and money as an acquisition-program progresses through system-demonstration and into production . 2 dod directive 5000.1 , the defense acquisition-system ( oct. 23 , 2000 ) , dod instruction 5000.2 , operation of the defense acquisition-system ( apr . 5 , 2002 ) , and dod regulation 5000.2-r , mandatory procedures for major defense acquisition-programs ( mdaps ) and major automated information-system ( mais ) acquisition-programs ( apr . 5 , 2002 ) . page 5 gao-02-701 best-practices principal-findings timely design and manufacturing-knowledge is critical to program success knowledge that a product 's design is stable early in the program-facilitates informed-decisions about whether to significantly increase investments and reduces the risk of costly-design-changes that can result from unknowns after initial-manufacturing begins . likewise , later-knowledge that the design can be manufactured affordably and with consistent high quality prior to making a production-decision ensures that targets for cost and schedule during production will be met . leading-commercial companies do not make significant-investments to continue a product development or its production until they have knowledge that the product 's design works and it can be manufactured efficiently within cost and schedule-expectations . dod-programs that captured-knowledge similar to commercial-companies had more successful-outcomes . for example , the aim-9x and the f/a-18e/f captured design and manufacturing-knowledge by key-decision-points and limited-cost-increases to 4 percent or less and schedule-growth to 3 months or less . in fact , the aim-9x had 95 percent of its drawings completed at its critical-design-review . the f/a-18e/f had 56 percent of its drawings completed and also had over 90 percent of its higher level interface-drawings completed , adding-confidence in the system-design . both took-steps to ensure that manufacturing-processes were capable of producing an affordable-product by the time the programs made production-decisions . on the other hand , the f-22 , pac-3 , and advanced-threat infrared countermeasures/common missile warning system ( atircm/cmws ) programs did not capture sufficient-knowledge before significant-investments to continue the programs and experienced-cost-growth that ranged from 23 to 182 percent and schedule-delays that ranged from 18 months to over 3 years . none of these programs had completed more than 26 percent of their engineering-drawings for their critical-design-reviews , and only the f-22 and pac-3 programs attempted to track the capability of their critical-manufacturing-processes prior to production . best-practices enable timely-capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge leading-commercial companies developed practices that enabled the timely-capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge . first , they used an evolutionary-approach to product development by establishing timephased-plans to develop a new product in increments based on technologies and resources achievable now and later . this approach reduced the amount of risk in the development of each increment , facilitating greater success in meeting-cost , schedule , and performance-requirements . the commercial-companies gao visited used the evolutionary-approach as their method for product development . each company had a plan for eventually achieving a quantum-leap in the performance of its products and had established an orderly , phased process for getting there , by undertaking continuous-product-improvements as resources became available . for the most part , dod-programs try to achieve the same leap in performance but in just one step , contributing to development-times that can take over 15 years to deliver a new capability to the military-user . second , each leading-commercial company had a product-development-process that was prominent and central to its success . the process was championed by executive-leadership and embraced by product-managers and development-teams as an effective way to do business . critical to the product-development-process were activities that enabled the capture of specific-design and manufacturing-knowledge and decision-reviews to determine if the knowledge captured would support the increased investment necessary to move to the next-development-phase or into production . these activities provided-knowledge that the product-design was stable at the decision-point to start initial-manufacturing ( exiting the integration-phase ) as demonstrated by the completion of 90 percent of the engineering-drawings . they also captured-knowledge that a product was ready to begin production ( exiting the demonstration-phase ) as demonstrated by proof that critical-processes were in control and product-reliability was achievable . the activities that enabled the capture and use of this knowledge to make decisions are listed in table 1 . table 1 : activities that enable the capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge design is stable-product can be produced • limit the design-challenge . • identify key-system-characteristics and critical-manufacturing-processes . • demonstrate , through prototyping or other means , that product • determine that processes are in control and stable . works . • complete-design-reviews of system and subsystems . • analyze potential-failure-modes and their effects on performance . • obtain stakeholder-concurrence that the design is complete and • set reliability-goals and growth-plan and conduct reliability-producible . testing . dod-programs that had more successful-outcomes used-key best-practices to a greater degree than others . for example , the aim-9x missile-program completed 95 percent of its engineering-drawings at the critical-design-review because it made extensive-use of prototype-testing to demonstrate the design met-requirements coupled with design-reviews that included-program-stakeholders . the f/a-18-e/f program eliminated over 40 percent of the parts used to build predecessor-aircraft to make the design more robust for manufacturing and identified critical-manufacturing-processes , bringing them under control before the start of production . both programs developed products that evolved from existing-versions , making the design-challenge more manageable . on the other hand , dod-programs with less successful-outcomes did not apply best-practices to a great-extent . at their initial-manufacturing decision-reviews , the f-22 , pac-3 , and atircm/cmws had less than onethird of their engineering-drawings , in part , because they did not use prototypes to demonstrate the design met-requirements before starting initial-manufacturing . on the f-22 program , it was almost 3 years after this review before 90 percent of the drawings needed to build the f-22 were completed . likewise , at their production-decision-reviews , these programs did not capture manufacturing and product-reliability-knowledge consistent with best-practices . for example , the pac-3 missile-program had less than 40 percent of its processes-in-control and , as a result , the missile-seekers had to be built , tested , and reworked on average 4 times before they were acceptable . the f-22 entered-production despite being substantially behind its plan to achieve reliability-goals . as a result , the f-22 is requiring significantly more maintenance-actions than planned . a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge dod 's acquisition-policy establishes a good-framework for developing-weapon-systems ; however , more specific-criteria , disciplined-adherence , and stronger acquisition-incentives are needed to ensure the timely-capture and use of knowledge and decision-making . dod recently changed its acquisition-policy to emphasize evolutionary-acquisition and establish separate-integration and demonstration-phases in the product-development-process . its goal was to develop higher quality-systems in less time and for less cost . while similar to the leading-commercial companies ' approach , the policy lacks detailed-criteria for capturing and using-design and manufacturing-knowledge to facilitate better decisions and more successful-acquisition-program outcomes . it also lacks a decision-review to proceed from the integration-phase to the demonstration-phase of product development . while the right-policy and criteria are necessary to ensure a disciplined , knowledge-based product-development-process , the incentives that influence the key-players in the acquisition-process will ultimately determine whether they will be used effectively . in dod , current-incentives are geared toward delaying knowledge so as not to jeopardize program-funding . this undermines a knowledge-based-process for making-product-development decisions . instead , program-managers and contractors push the capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge to later in the development-program to avoid the identification of problems that might stop or limit-funding . they focus more on meeting-schedules than capturing-knowledge . on the other hand , commercial-companies must develop high-quality-products quickly or they may not survive in the marketplace . because of this , they encourage their managers to capture product-design and manufacturing-knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development , before making significant-increases in their investment . instead of a schedule-driven process , their process is driven by events that bring them knowledge : critical-design-reviews that are supported by completed engineering-drawings and production-decisions supported by reliability-testing and statistical-process-control data . they do not move forward without the design and manufacturing-knowledge needed to make informed-decisions . gao recommends that the secretary of defense revise policy and guidance recommendations for on the operation of the defense acquisition-system to include ( 1 ) a requirement to capture specific-design knowledge to be used as exit-criteria for transitioning from system-integration to system-demonstration and ( 2 ) a requirement that the current optional-interim-progress review between system-integration and demonstration be a mandatory decision-review requiring the program-manager to verify that design is stable and that this be reported in the program 's defense acquisition executive-summary and selected acquisition report . the policy and guidance should also be revised to include ( 1 ) a requirement to capture and use specific-manufacturing-knowledge at the production-commitment-point as exit-criteria to transition from system-demonstration into production and ( 2 ) a requirement to structure major-weapon-system contracts to ensure the capture and use of knowledge for dod to make investment-decisions at critical-junctures when transitioning from system-integration to system-demonstration and then into production . dod generally agreed with the report and its recommendations . a detailed agency-comments discussion of dod 's comments appears in appendix i . chapter 1 introduction the department of defense ( dod ) spends close to $ 100 billion annually to research , develop , and acquire weapon-systems , and this investment is expected to grow substantially . over the next 5 years , starting in fiscal year 2003 , dod 's request for weapon-system development and acquisition-funds is estimated to be $ 700 billion ( see fig . 1 ) . how effectively dod manages these funds will determine whether it receives a good-return on its investment . our reviews over the past 20 years have consistently found that dod 's weapon-system-acquisitions take much longer and cost much more than originally anticipated , causing-disruptions to the department 's overall investment-strategy and significantly reducing its buying-power . because such disruptions can limit dod 's ability to effectively execute war-fighting-operations , it is critical to find better ways of doing business . in view of the importance of dod 's investment in weapon-systems , we have undertaken an extensive-body of work that examines dod's acquisition-issues from a different , more cross-cutting perspective-one that draws lessons learned from the best commercial product-development-efforts to see if they apply to weapon-system-acquisitions . this report looks at the core of the acquisition-process , specifically-product-development and ways to successfully-design and manufacture the product . our previous-reports looked at such issues as how companies matched-customer-needs and resources , tested products , assured quality , and managed-suppliers and are listed in related gao products at the end of the report . best-practices of leading-commercial companies figure 1 : research , development , test and evaluation , and procurement funding for fiscal-years 1995 to 2007 source : dod . leading-commercial companies expect their program-managers to deliver high-quality-products on time and within budget . doing otherwise could result in the customer walking away . thus , the companies have created an environment and adopted-practices that put their program-managers in a good-position to succeed in meeting these expectations . collectively , these practices ensure that a high level of knowledge exists about critical-facets of the product at key-junctures during development . such a knowledgebased-process enables decision-makers to be reasonably-certain about critical-facets of the product under development when they need this knowledge . to ensure the right-level of knowledge at each key-decision point in product development , leading-commercial companies separate-technology from product development and take steps to ensure the product-design is stabilized early so product-performance and producibility can be demonstrated before production . the process followed by leading-companies , illustrated in figure 2 , can be broken down into the following three knowledge-points . • knowledge-point 1 occurs when a match is made between the customer 's needs and the available-resources-technology , design , time , and funding . to achieve this match , technologies needed to meet essential-product-requirements must be demonstrated to work in their intended environment . in addition , the product-developer must complete a preliminary-product-design using-systems-engineering to balance-customer desires with available-resources . • knowledge-point 2 occurs when the product 's design demonstrates its ability to meet performance-requirements . program-officials are confident that the design is stable and will perform acceptably when at least 90 percent of engineering-drawings are complete . engineering-drawings reflect the results of testing and simulation and describe how the product should be built . • knowledge-point 3 occurs when the product can be manufactured within cost , schedule , and quality-targets and is reliable . an important-indicator of this is when critical-manufacturing-processes are in control and consistently producing-items within quality-standards and tolerances . another indicator is when a product 's reliability is demonstrated through iterative testing that identifies and corrects design-problems . figure 2 : knowledge-based-process for applying best-practices to the development of new products source : gao 's analysis . this report focuses on best-practices for achieving-knowledge points 2 and 3 , particularly at how successful-companies-design and manufacture a product within established cost , schedule , and quality-targets . the concepts discussed build on our previous-reports , which looked at the earlier phases of an acquisition , including matching-customer needs and available-resources . a key-success-factor evident in all our work is the ability to obtain the right-knowledge at the right-time and to build knowledge to the point that decision-makers can make informed-decisions about moving ahead to the next-phase . programs that do this typically have successful-cost and schedule-outcomes . programs that do not typically encounter problems that eventually cascade and become magnified through the product development and production-phases . as shown in figure 3 , the effects of not following a knowledge-based-process can be debilitating . dod 's traditional-approach to product development figure 3 : notional-illustration showing the different-paths that a product 's development can take source : gao 's analysis . dod has historically developed new weapon-systems in a highly concurrent-environment that usually forces acquisition-programs to manage technology , design , and manufacturing-risk at the same time . this environment has made it difficult for either dod or congressional-decision-makers to make informed-decisions because appropriate-knowledge has not been available at key-decision-points in product development . dod 's common-practice for managing this environment has been to create aggressive risk-reduction efforts in its programs . cost-reduction initiatives that typically arise after a program is experiencing-problems are common-tools used to manage these risks . figure 4 shows the overlapping and concurrent-approach that dod uses to develop its weapon-systems . this figure shows that dod continues to capture technology , design , and manufacturing-knowledge long after a program passes through each of the three knowledge-points when this knowledge should have been available for program-decisions . figure 4 : dod 's concurrent-approach to weapon-system development source : gao 's analysis . more important , the problems created by this concurrent-approach on individual-programs can profoundly affect dod 's overall modernization-plans . it is difficult to prioritize and allocate limited-budgets among needed requirements when acquisition-programs ' cost and schedule are always in question . programs that are managed without the knowledge-based-process are more likely to have surprises in the form of cost and schedule-increases that are accommodated by disrupting the funding of other programs . because of these disruptions , decision-makers are not able to focus on a balanced-investment-strategy . dod is taking-steps to change the culture of the acquisition-community dod 's adoption of with actions aimed at reducing product development cycle-times and improving the predictability of cost and schedule-outcomes . dod recently made constructive-changes to its acquisition-policy that embrace best objectives , scope , and methodology practices . these changes focused primarily on ( 1 ) ensuring technologies are demonstrated to a high level of maturity before beginning a weapon-system-program and ( 2 ) taking an evolutionary , or phased , approach to developing new weapon-systems . because these changes occurred in 2000 and 2001 , it is too early to determine how effectively they will be put into practice . while these are good first steps , further use of best-practices in product development would provide a greater opportunity to improve weapon-system-cost and schedule-outcomes . our overall-objective was to determine whether best-practices offer-methods to improve the way dod ensures that the design is stable early in the development-process and whether having manufacturing-processes in control before production-results in better cost , schedule , and quality-outcomes in dod major-acquisition-programs . specifically , we identified best-practices that have led to more successful-product-development and production outcomes , compared the best-practices to those used in dod-programs , and analyzed current weapon-system acquisition-guidance for applicability of best-practices . to determine the best-practices for ensuring-product-design and manufacturing-maturity from the commercial-sector , we conducted general-literature-searches . on the basis of our literature-searches and discussions with experts , we identified a number of commercial-companies as having innovative-development-processes and practices that resulted in successful-product-development . we visited the following commercial-companies : • caterpillar designs and manufactures construction and mining-equipment , diesel and natural-gas-engines , and industrial gas-turbines . in 2001 , it reported-sales and revenues totaling $ 20.45 billion . we visited its offices in peoria , illinois . • cummins inc. ( engine business-group ) designs and manufactures diesel and natural-gas-engines ranging in size from 60 to 3,500 horsepower for mining , construction , agriculture , rail , oil and gas , heavy and mediumduty-trucks , buses , and motor-homes . in 2001 , the engine business-group reported-sales of $ 3.1 billion . we visited its offices in columbus , indiana . • general electric aircraft engines designs and manufactures jet-engines for civil and military-aircraft and gas-turbines , derived from its successful jet engine programs , for marine and industrial-applications . in 2001 , it reported-earnings totaling $ 11.4 billion . we visited its offices in evendale , ohio . • hewlett packard designs and manufactures computing systems and imaging and printing-systems for individual and business-use . in 2001 , it reported-revenues totaling $ 45.2 billion . we visited its offices involved in the design and manufacturing of complex ink jet imaging equipment in corvallis , oregon . • xerox corporation designs and manufactures office-equipment , including-color and black and white-printers , digital presses , multifunction-devices , and digital-copiers designed for offices and production-printing-environments . in 2001 , it reported-revenues totaling $ 16.5 billion . we visited its offices in rochester , new york . at each of the five companies , we conducted structured-interviews with representatives to gather uniform and consistent information about each company 's new product-development-processes and best-practices . during meetings with these representatives , we obtained a detailed-description of the processes and practices they believed necessary and vital to mature a product-design and get manufacturing-processes under control . we met with design-engineers , program-managers , manufacturing and quality-engineers , and developers of the knowledge-based-processes and policies . during the past 5 years , we have gathered-information on product development-practices from such companies as 3m , boeing commercial airplane group , chrysler corporation , bombardier aerospace , ford motor company , hughes space and communications , and motorola corporation . this information enabled us to develop an overall model to describe the general-approach leading-commercial companies take to develop new products . our report highlights several best-practices in product development based on our fieldwork . as such , they are not intended to describe all practices or suggest that commercial-companies are without flaws . representatives from the commercial-companies visited told us that the development of their best-practices has evolved over many years and that the practices continue to be improved based on lessons learned and new ideas and information . they admit that the application and use of these have not always been consistent or without error . however , they strongly suggested that the probability of success in developing new products is greatly enhanced by the use of these practices . further , because of the sensitivity to how data that would show the actual-outcomes of new product-development-efforts might affect their competitive standing , we did not obtain specific-cost , schedule , and performance-data . most examples provided by these companies were anecdotal . however , the continued-success of these companies over time in a competitive-marketplace indicated that their practices were important and key to their operations . furthermore , based on our observations during meetings at these companies , it was apparent that because of the level of detailed-process-tools developed for their managers and executive-leadership these best-practices were a centerpiece of their operations . next , we compared and contrasted the best-practices with product development-practices used in five dod major-acquisition-programs . below is a brief-description of each program we examined : • the f-22 fighter aircraft program . this aircraft is designed with advanced-features to allow it to be less detectable to adversaries , capable of high speeds for long ranges , and able to provide the pilot with improved awareness of the surrounding situation through the use of integrated avionics . the f-22 program began in 1986 and entered limited-production in 2001 . the air force expects to buy 341 at a total-acquisition-cost ( development and procurement ) estimated at $ 69.7 billion . • the patriot advanced capability ( pac-3 ) missile-program . this program is intended to enhance the patriot system , an air-defense , guided missile-system . pac-3 is designed to enhance the patriot radar 's ability to detect and identify targets , increase system computer capabilities , improve communications , increase the number of missiles in each launcher , and incorporate a new `` hit-to-kill '' missile . the `` hit-to-kill '' missile-capabilities represent a major-part of the development-program , as these are not capabilities included in prior-versions of the patriot system . the missile-program began in 1994 and entered limited-production in 1999 . the army plans to buy 1,159 missiles at a total-acquisition-cost estimated at $ 8.5 billion . • the advanced-threat infrared countermeasures/common missile warning system ( atircm/cmws )

and fire on targets over a wider area than the aim-9m . the aim-9x program began in 1994 and entered limited-production in 2000 . dod plans to buy 10,142 missiles at a total-acquisition-cost estimated

and performance-data presented in the selected acquisition reports3 for each program . we also selected these programs because we considered them to be in two basic-categories-successful and unsuccessful-cost and schedule-performance-outcomes . this basis for selection was to compare and contrast the development-practices used on each with best-practices used by the commercial-companies . for each program , we interviewed key-managers and design and manufacturing-engineering-representatives . in some cases , we discussed design and manufacturing-issues with representatives of the primary-contractor for the specific-program to obtain information on the practices and procedures used by the program to ready 3 the selected acquisition report provides standard , comprehensive-summary-reporting of cost , schedule , and performance-information for major defense acquisition-programs to the congress . page 20 gao-02-701 best-practices the product-design for initial-manufacturing and testing as well as for production . we also discussed the use and potential application of best-practices that we identified . in addition to discussions , we analyzed significant-amounts of data on engineering-drawings , design-changes , labor-efficiencies , manufacturing-processes , quality-indicators , testing , and schedules . we did not verify the accuracy of the data but did correlate it to other program-indicators for reasonableness . our analysis of the data was used as a basis to develop indicators of each program 's development efficiencies and detailed-questions to discuss product-design and manufacturing-practices . we conducted our review between may 2001 and april 2002 in accordance with generally accepted-government-auditing standards . chapter 2 timely design and manufacturing-knowledge is critical to program success dod-programs had better outcomes when design and manufacturing-knowledge was captured at key-program junctures the success of any effort to develop a new product hinges on having the right-knowledge at the right-time . every program eventually achieves this knowledge ; however , leading-commercial companies we visited have found that there is a much better opportunity to meet predicted cost , schedule , and quality-targets when it is captured early , in preparation for critical-decisions . specifically , knowledge that a product 's design is stable early in the program-facilitates informed-decisions about whether to significantly increase investments and reduces the risk of costly-design-changes that can result from unknowns after initial-manufacturing begins . this knowledge comes in the form of completed engineering-drawings before transitioning from the system-integration-phase to the system-demonstration-phase of product development . best-practices suggest that at least 90 percent of the drawings for a product 's design be completed before a decision to commit additional-resources is made . likewise , later-knowledge that the design can be manufactured affordably and with consistent high quality prior to making a production-decision ensures that cost and schedule-targets will be met . this knowledge comes in the form of evidence from data that shows manufacturing-processes are in control and system-reliability is achievable . leading-commercial companies rely on knowledge obtained about critical-manufacturing-processes and product-reliability to make their production-decisions . the department of defense ( dod ) programs we reviewed captured varying-amounts of design and manufacturing-knowledge in the form of completed engineering-drawings and statistical-process-control data . we found a correlation between the amount of knowledge each captured and their cost and schedule-outcomes . programs that were able to complete more engineering-drawings and control their critical-manufacturing-processes had more success in meeting-cost and schedule-targets established when they began . conceptually , the product-development-process has two phases : a system-integration-phase to stabilize the product 's design and a system-demonstration-phase to demonstrate the product can be manufactured affordably and work reliably . the system-integration-phase is used to stabilize the overall-system-design by integrating components and subsystems into a product and by showing that the design can meet product-requirements . when this knowledge is captured , knowledge-point 2 has been achieved . it should be demonstrated by the completion of at least 90 percent of engineering-drawings , which both dod and leading-commercial companies consider to be the point when a product 's design is essentially-complete . in the dod process , this knowledge-point should happen by the critical-design-review , before system-demonstration and the initial-manufacturing of production-representative products begins . the system-demonstration-phase is then used to demonstrate that the product will work as required and can be manufactured within targets . when this knowledge is captured , knowledge-point 3 has been achieved . critical-manufacturing-processes are in control and consistently producing-items within quality-standards and tolerances for the overall product . also , product-reliability has been demonstrated . in the dod process , like with the commercial-process , this knowledge-point should happen by the production-commitment-milestone . bypassing critical-knowledge at either knowledge-point will usually result in cost , schedule , and performance-problems later in product development and production . we found that the most successful-programs had taken steps to gather knowledge that confirmed the product 's design was stable before the design was released to manufacturing-organizations to build products for demonstration . they had most of the detailed design complete , supported by the completion of a large-percentage of engineering-drawings to manufacturing . again , engineering-drawings are critical because they include details on the parts and work-instructions needed to make the product and reflect the results of testing . these drawings allowed-manufacturing-personnel to effectively plan the fabrication-process and efficiently build production-representative-prototypes in the factory so manufacturing-processes and the product 's performance could be validated before committing to production . the most successful dod-programs also captured the knowledge that manufacturing-processes needed to build the product would consistently produce a reliable-product by the end of system-demonstration , before making a production-decision . on these programs , the initial-phase of production-sometimes known as low-rate initial-production-was able to focus on building operational-test-articles and improving the production-processes , instead of continuing the product 's design and development . problematic-programs moved forward into system-demonstration without the same knowledge from engineering-drawings that successful-cases had captured . they increased-investments in tooling , people , and materials before the design was stable . in these programs , only a small-percentage of the drawings needed to make the products had been completed at the time the designs were released to manufacturing-organizations for building-production representative-prototypes . in doing so , these programs undertook the difficult-challenge of stabilizing the designs at the same time they were trying to build and test the products . this design immaturity caused costly-design-changes and parts-shortages that , in turn , caused-labor-inefficiencies , schedule-delays , and quality problems . consequently , these programs required significant-increases in resources -- time and money-over what was estimated at the point each program began the system-demonstration-phase . the most problematic-programs also started-production before design and manufacturing-development-work was concluded . in these cases , programs were producing-items for the customers while making major-product-design and tooling-changes , still establishing manufacturing-processes , and conducting-development-testing . these programs encountered significant-cost-increases , schedule-delays , and performance-problems during production . table 2 shows the relationship between design-stability and manufacturing-knowledge at key-junctures and the outcomes for the dod-programs we reviewed . to measure-design-stability at the start of the system-demonstration-phase , knowledge-point 2 , we determined the percentage of the product 's engineering-drawings that had been completed by the critical-design-review . in dod-programs , after the critical-design-review , the system-design is released to manufacturing to begin building the production-representative-prototypes for the system-demonstration-phase . to measure producibility at the production-decision , knowledge-point 3 , we determined whether the critical-manufacturing-processes were in statistical-control at that time . we compared this information with best-practices . the cost and schedule-experiences of the program since the start of system-demonstration are also shown . table 2 : attainment of design and manufacturing-knowledge in dod-programs and the program-outcomes awhile aim-9x used statistical-process-control on a limited basis , we believe other factors contributed to a successful-production-outcome to date . other factors included early achievement of design-stability , early-identification of key-characteristics and critical-manufacturing-processes , use of established manufacturing-processes for components common to other weapon-systems , design-trade-offs to enhance manufacturing-capability , and a product-design less vulnerable to variations in manufacturing-processes . bf/a-18 e/f had 56 percent of drawings completed but also had completed most of the higher-level-assembly-drawings . the combination of these drawings with the fact the aircraft was a variant of previously fielded f-18 aircraft models provided the program a significant amount of knowledge that the design was stable at the start of system-demonstration . source : dod program-offices and selected acquisition reports . as shown in the table , the aim-9x and fa-18 e/f programs had captured a significant amount of design-knowledge at the start of system-demonstration and manufacturing-knowledge by the start of production . in each of those programs , product-developers had the advantage of prior-versions of the systems . these programs came very close to meeting their original-cost and schedule-estimates for product development . the other three programs , f-22 , pac-3 , and atircm/cmws , had less knowledge at each key-junctures . their development-cost and schedule-results significantly exceeded estimates . specific-details on the aim-9x , f-22 , and atircm/cmws program-experiences follow . aim-9x program-experience the aim-9x program began in 1994 , continuing the long-term evolution of the aim-9 series of short-range-air-to-air-missiles . in 1999 , after developing and testing a number of engineering prototype-missiles , the program held a critical-design-review to determine if the program was ready to begin initial-manufacturing of a production-representative-prototype for system-demonstration . at this review , about 95 percent of the eventual-engineering drawings were completed-a stable-design by best-practices . because aim-9x was the next generation in this family of missiles , the program had significant-knowledge on how to produce the missile . at the 1999 critical-design-review , the estimated-development and production costs totaled $ 2.82 billion . as of december 2001 , the estimate was $ 2.96 billion , less than a 5-percent-increase . f-22 program-experience the f-22 program began detailed design-efforts in 1991 when it entered a planned 8-year product development-phase . in 1995 , about the expected midpoint of the phase , the program held its critical-design-review to determine if the design was stable and complete . despite having only about a quarter of the eventual-design-drawings completed for the system , the program declared the design to be stable and ready to begin initial-manufacturing . at that time , the program-office had estimated the cost to complete the development-program at $ 19.5 billion . however , the program did not complete 90 percent of its drawings for the aircraft until 1998 , 3 years into the system-demonstration-phase . during the building of the initial-aircraft , several-design and manufacturing-problems surfaced that affected the deliveries of major-sections of the aircraft . large-sections were delivered incomplete to final-assembly and had to be built out of the planned-assembly-sequence . in 1997 , an independent-review-team examined the program and determined the product-development-effort was underestimated . the team found that building the first three aircraft was taking substantially more labor-hours than planned . between 1995 and 1998 , the development-estimate for the f-22 increased by over $ 3.3 billion and the schedule slipped by a year . achieving-design stability late has contributed to further cost-increases . as of december 2001 , the estimated-development-cost was $ 26.1 billion , a 34-percent-increase since the critical-design-review was held in 1995 . while the program attributes some production-cost-increases to a reduction in f-22 quantities , it has been significantly affected by design and atircm/cmws program-experience manufacturing-problems that started during development . the independent-review-team evaluated the cost-impact on the production-aircraft that would likely occur because of cost and schedule-problems in development and found that production-aircraft would have to begin later , at a slower pace , and cost more than expected . the team estimated that production costs could increase by as much as $ 13 billion if savings were not found . the air force subsequently increased the estimate to more than $ 19 billion in cost-savings required to avoid cost-increases . in 2001 , when the f-22 limited-production-decision was made , the program had less knowledge about the aircraft 's reliability and manufacturing-processes than more successful-cases . for example , at its limited-production-decision , it had only 44 percent of its critical-manufacturing-processes in control . in september 2001 , the program reported that overall-production-cost would likely increase by more than $ 5.4 billion . this estimate was based on the effort needed so far to build the aircraft during product development . since it began in 1995 , the atircm/cmws program has had significant-cost-growth and schedule-delays during product development . the product-developer held a major-design-review in 1997 . like the f-22 , the review demanded less proof about the product 's design in the form of engineering-drawings before deciding to begin initial-manufacturing . at that time , only 21 percent of the engineering-drawings had been completed , and it was still unknown whether the design would meet the requirements . in fact , the program knew that a major-redesign of a critical-component was needed . despite this , the program-office deemed the risk acceptable for moving the program forward to begin manufacturing-prototypes . over the next 2 years , the program encountered numerous-design and manufacturing-problems . it was not until 1999 , about 2 years after the critical-design-review , that program-officials felt that the design had stabilized ; however , by this time , the product-development-cost had increased 160 percent and production had been delayed by almost 3 years . atircm/cmws is scheduled to begin limited-production in early 2002 , but without the same degree of assurance as the more successful-programs that the product can be manufactured within cost , schedule , and quality-targets . the program has not yet determined if manufacturing-processes needed to build the product are in control . many of the development-units were built by hand , in different-facilities , and with different-processes and personnel . program-officials stated that because they did not stabilize the design until late in development , manufacturing-issues were not adequately addressed . since 1997 , the estimated unit-cost for the system has increased by 182 percent . chapter 3 best-practices enable timely-capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge leading-commercial companies have been successful in achieving product-development-goals because they have found ways to enable the capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge about the products they are developing in a timely way . we found two practices that allowed leading-commercial companies to capture necessary-knowledge for product development . first , they established a framework of evolutionary-product-development that limited the amount of design and manufacturing-knowledge that had to be captured . this framework limited the design-challenge for any one new product development by requiring risky-technology , design , or manufacturing-requirements to be deferred until a future-generation of the product . second , each company ( 1 ) employed a disciplined product-development-process that brought together and integrated all of the technologies , components , and subsystems required for the product to ensure the design was stable before entering-product-demonstration and ( 2 ) demonstrated the product was reliable and producible using proven manufacturing-processes before entering-production . the product-development-process includes tools that both capture knowledge and tie this knowledge to decisions about the product's design and manufacturing-processes before making-commitments that would significantly affect company-resources . for example , during system-integration , each leading-commercial company used various-forms of prototypes and information from predecessor-products to stabilize the product 's design and identify critical-processes , then used a decision-review that required-agreements from key-stakeholders that the requisite-design-knowledge was captured in making a decision to move into system-demonstration . during system-demonstration , each company used statistical-process-control and reliability-testing to ensure the product could be produced affordably and would be reliable , then used a similar-decision review that required-agreements from key-stakeholders that the requisite-knowledge was captured when deciding to move into production . the department of defense ( dod ) programs that we reviewed used some of these practices to varying-degrees and experienced predictable-outcomes . for example , the aim-9x and f/a-18 e/f programs were evolutionary in nature , modifications of existing-products with a manageable-amount of new technological or design challenges . they also gathered-design and manufacturing-knowledge , although not to the extent we found at commercial-companies . finally , they held-program-reviews and ensured that the design and manufacturing-knowledge was captured before moving forward . they had relatively successful-outcomes . the other dod leading-commercial companies use evolutionary-product-development framework to reduce development risks programs-the f-22 , atircms , and pac-3-did not closely approximate best-practices in capturing-design or manufacturing-knowledge during product development . they took on greater design challenges , had program-reviews that were not supported by critical-design and manufacturing-knowledge , and made decisions to advance to the next-phases of development without sufficient-design and manufacturing-knowledge . a key to the success of commercial-companies was using an evolutionary-approach to develop a product . this approach permitted companies to focus more on design and development with a limited array of new content and technologies in a program . it also ensured that each company had the requisite-knowledge for a product's design before investing in the development of manufacturing-processes and facilities . companies have found that trying to capture the knowledge required to stabilize the design of a product that requires significant-amounts of new content is an unmanageable task , especially if the goal is to reduce cycle-times and get the product into the marketplace as quickly as possible . design elements not achievable in the initial-development were planned for subsequent-development-efforts in future-generations of the product , but only when technologies were proven to be mature and other resources were available . commercial-companies have implemented the evolutionary-approach by establishing time-phased-plans to develop new products in increments based on technologies and resources achievable now and later . this approach reduces the amount of risk in the development of each increment , facilitating greater success in meeting-cost , schedule , and performance-requirements . in effect , these companies evolve products , continuously improving their performance as new technologies and methods allow . these evolutionary-improvements to products eventually result in the full desired capability , but in multiple-steps , delivering a series of enhanced-interim capabilities to the customer more quickly . historically , dod 's approach has been to develop new weapon-systems that often attempt to satisfy the full-requirement in a single-step , regardless of the design-challenge or the maturity of technologies necessary to achieve the full-capability . under this single-step-approach , a war-fighter can wait over 15 years to receive any improved-capability . figure 5 shows a notional comparison between the single-step and evolutionary-approaches . figure 5 : notional-single-step and evolutionary-approaches to developing new products source : gao 's analysis and dod acquisition-guidance . each commercial-company we visited used the evolutionary-approach as the primary-method of product development . general electric builds on the basic-capability of a fielded-product by introducing proven improvements in capability from its advanced engineering-development-team . general electric considers the introduction of immature-technologies into fielded-products or new engine-development-programs as a significant-cost and schedule-risk . its new product-development-process is primarily focused on reducing and managing-risk for design-changes and product leading-commercial companies use a product-development-process to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge for decision-making introductions . cummins and hewlett packard managers indicated that , in the past , their companies learned the hard way by trying to make quantum-leaps in product-performance and by including immature-technologies . now , both companies have new product-development-processes that actively manage the amount of new content that can be placed on a new product-development-effort . caterpillar also limits new content on its new products as a way to more successfully and cost-effectively develop new , but evolutionary , products . even during the development of its 797-mining-truck , which it considered a major-design-challenge , it did not require the truck to achieve capabilities-such as prognostics for better maintenance-that it could not demonstrate or validate in the design in a timely manner . of the five dod-programs we reviewed , two-the f/a-18-e/f and the aim-9x-were variations of existing products-the f/a-18-c/d and the aim-9m-and the programs made a commitment to use existing-technologies and processes as much as possible . these two programs had relatively successful-cost and schedule-outcomes . they represented an exception to the usual-practice in dod . the overwhelming-majority of dod 's major-acquisitions-today require major-leaps in capability over their predecessors or any other competing-weapon-systems , with little-knowledge about the resources that will be required to design and manufacture the systems . decisions are continually made throughout product development without knowing the cost and schedule-ramifications . leading-commercial companies we visited had spent significant-amounts of time and resources to develop and evolve new product-development-processes that ensured-design and manufacturing-knowledge was captured at the two critical-decision-points in product development : when the product 's design was demonstrated to be stable-knowledge-point 2-and when the product was demonstrated to be producible at an affordable-cost-knowledge-point 3 . the process established a disciplined-framework to capture specific-design and manufacturing-knowledge about new products . companies then used that knowledge to make informed-decisions about moving forward in a new product-development-program . commercial-companies tied this knowledge to decisions about the products ' design and manufacturing-processes before making-commitments that would significantly impact company-resources . each commercial-firm we visited had a new product-development-process that was prominent and central to the firm 's successes . it included three design-knowledge should be captured before entering-product-demonstration aspects : ( 1 ) activities that led to the capture of specific-design knowledge , ( 2 ) activities that led to the capture of specific-manufacturing and product-reliability-knowledge , and ( 3 ) decision-reviews to determine if the appropriate-knowledge was captured to move to the next-phase . to ensure that the product 's design was stable before deciding to commit additional-resources to product-demonstration , commercial-companies demanded-knowledge , either from existing-product information or by building-engineering-prototypes . they also used a disciplined design-review-process to examine and verify the knowledge that had culminated at the end of product-integration , this design-review-process required-agreement from stakeholders that the product-design could be produced and would satisfy the customer 's requirements . stakeholders included-design-engineers , manufacturing or production-personnel , and key-supplier representatives who used-engineering-drawings , supported by test results and engineering-data , as a key-indicator of the design's stability . once the program achieved a stable-design , the certainty of their cost and schedule-estimates was substantially increased , allowing them to plan the balance of the product-development-program with high confidence . table 3 shows the activities required to capture design-knowledge that leads to executive-decisions about whether to transition to the next-phase of development . table 3 : activities to capture design-knowledge and make decisions activities to achieve stable-design knowledge • limit-design-challenge - the initial-design-challenge is limited to a product that can be developed and delivered quickly and provide the user with an improved-capability . a time-phased plan is used to develop improved products-future-generations-in increments as technologies and other resources become available . • demonstrate-design meets requirements -the product's design is demonstrated to meet the user 's requirements . for a new product that is not based on an existing-product , prototypes are built and tested . if the product is a variant of an existing-product , companies often used-modeling and simulation or prototypes at the component or subsystem-level to demonstrate the new product 's design . • complete critical-design-reviews - critical-design-reviews are used to assess whether a product 's design meets requirements and is ready to start initial-manufacturing . they are conducted for the system , subsystems , and components to assess design-maturity and technical-risk . • stakeholders agree drawings complete and producible - the agreement by stakeholders ( engineers , manufacturers , and other organizations ) is used to signify-confidence that the design will work and the product can be built . • executive-level-review to begin initial-manufacturing - corporate-stakeholders meet and review relevant-product-knowledge , including-design-stability , to determine whether a product is ready to initiate manufacturing of production-representative-prototypes used during system-demonstrations . the decision is tied to the capture of knowledge . demonstrating the design helped achieve stability a key-tool used by each company to ensure that a product's design was stable by the end of the product-integration-phase was a demonstration that the design would meet requirements . the companies visited indicated that prototypes at various-system levels were the best way to demonstrate that the product 's design would work . if the product under development was an incremental improvement to existing-products , such as the next generation of a printer or engine , these companies used virtual-prototypes for any components that were being used for the first time . if the product included more new content or invention , fully integrated prototypes were frequently used to demonstrate that the design met-requirements . prototypes at this stage in development were typically not built in a manufacturing-facility . this allowed demonstrations of the design before the companies made more costly investments in manufacturing-equipment and tooling to build production-representative-prototypes for the demonstration-phase . table 4 shows an example of the types and purposes for various kinds of prototypes used by cummins inc. depending on the amount of knowledge it needed to capture and the point it was in the development-process . prototypes were used by commercial-companies throughout the product-development-process and not just during product-integration . table 4 : examples of prototypes used by cummins inc. at various-stages of product development product-integration product-demonstration production prototype-engineering-prototypes ( virtual or production-representative-prototypes initial-products physical ) purpose demonstrate form , fit and function , and demonstrate the product is capable , demonstrate ready for full-rate a stable-design reliable , and manufacturing-production-processes in statistical-control build environment engineering manufacturing production ( all rate tooling ) ( 1st-set of production-tooling ) cummins , the world-sales-leader in diesel-engines over 200 horsepower , effectively uses prototypes to ensure that a design is stable and believes in the value of prototyping throughout product development . a cummins representative stated that not using-prototypes becomes a matter of `` pay me now or pay me later , '' meaning that it is far less costly to demonstrate a product's design early in development with prototypes , concepts , and analyses than to incur the cost of significant-design-changes after a product has entered production-a much more costly-environment to make changes . cummins built and tested 12-engineering-concept prototype-engines for its signature 600 engine , a new concept , 600 horsepower , disciplined-reviews and stakeholder agreements supported the capture of design-knowledge overhead cam diesel engine that represented a quantum-leap in performance beyond cummins ' existing-products . these prototypes were built using production-like-tooling and methods using production-workers . in addition to using-engineering-prototypes during the product-integration-phase of product development , cummins and other companies we visited used other prototypes-such as production-representative-prototypes-in the remaining-product development-phases before production , as shown in table 4 , to demonstrate-product-reliability and process-control . prior to reaching-production for its signature 600 engine , cummins used many prototypes to complete hundreds of thousands of test-hours , accumulating-millions of test-miles . caterpillar , a major-manufacturer of heavy-equipment , has a continuous product improvement philosophy . that is , it tries to develop new products that increase the capabilities of existing-product lines , but it limits the amount of new content on any one product development because new content inherently increases design risk . in evolving its products this way , caterpillar is able to use modeling and simulation prior to initial-manufacturing because it has existing-products to provide a baseline of knowledge and a good benchmark for assessing the simulated-performance . in addition , with knowledge of existing-components , it can focus attention on maturing the new content , the higher risk-element of the new product . when caterpillar developed the 797-mining-truck , a new 360ton payload truck-design , it demonstrated-design-stability by identifying the critical-components and building-engineering-prototypes of them for reliability-testing and demonstration of the design before beginning initial-manufacturing . this knowledge , coupled with vast-experience in manufacturing-trucks , ensured the stability of the 797-truck design before initial-manufacturing started . caterpillar was able to deliver this design in 18 months after the product development was started . the commercial-companies we visited understood the importance of having disciplined-design-reviews and getting-agreement from the stakeholders that the product 's design had been demonstrated to meet requirements before beginning initial-manufacturing . each company had a design-review-process that began at the component level , continued through the subsystem-level , and culminated with a critical-design-review of the integrated-system to determine if the product was ready to progress to the next-phase of development . in addition to design-engineers , a crossfunctional-team of stakeholders in the process included key-suppliers , manufacturing representatives , and service and maintenance-representatives . from past-experience , commercial-companies have executive-level-reviews were required to begin initial-manufacturing discovered that cross-functional-teams provide a complete perspective of the product . while design-engineers bring important skills and experience to creating a product-design , they may not be aware of manufacturing-issues , available-technologies , or manufacturing-processes , and they may design a product that the company can not afford to produce or maintain . the product 's design is stable when all stakeholders agree that engineering-drawings are complete and that the design will work and can be built . a commercial-company considers engineering-drawings4 to be a good-measure of the demonstrated stability of the product's design because they represent the language used by engineers to communicate to the manufacturers the details of a new product design-what it looks like , how its components interface , how it functions , how to build it , and what critical-materials and processes are required to fabricate and test it . the engineering drawing-package released to manufacturing includes items such as the schematic of the product 's components , interface-control documents , a listing of materials , notations of critical-manufacturing-processes , and testing-requirements . it is this package that allows a manufacturer to build the product in the manufacturing-facility . in developing the signature 600 , cummins used cross-functional design-teams that included-stakeholders from suppliers , machine-tool manufacturers , foundry and pattern-makers , purchasing , finance , manufacturing-engineering , design-engineering , and other technical-disciplines . signature 600 components were designed with the key-suppliers co-located at the cummins design-facility . likewise , caterpillar said that early-supplier and manufacturing involvement was critical to success and that engineering-drawings were signed by design and manufacturing-stakeholders . caterpillar representatives said that signing the drawings was a certification that the design could be manufactured the next day , if necessary . each commercial-company , after capturing specific-design knowledge , had an executive-level-review at the decision-point to determine if the product-design had sufficiently progressed to permit a transition from product-integration to product-demonstration . this decision-point used the knowledge captured as exit-criteria for moving to the next-phase of development . for example , to demonstrate the product-design was stable 4 engineering-drawings can include the standard two-dimensional drawings or newer threedimensional-drawings that are the product of computer-aided-design-software systems . page 36 gao-02-701 best-practices manufacturing and product-reliability-knowledge should be captured before starting-production and ready to move from integration to demonstration , the design had to be demonstrated , at least 90 percent of the engineering-drawings had to be completed , design-reviews had to be completed , and stakeholders had to agree the design was complete and producible . if the design-team could not satisfy the exit-criteria , then other options had to be considered . options included-canceling the development-program , delaying the decision until all criteria were met , or moving ahead with a detailed-plan to achieve criteria not met by a specific-time when leadership would revisit the other options . one company emphasized that if a major-milestone is delayed , an appropriate-adjustment should be made to the end-date of the program , thereby avoiding compressing the time allotted for the rest of product development and managing the risks that subsequent-milestones will be missed . this decision-point coincides with the companies ' need to increase investments in the product development and continue to the next-phase . for this reason , the decision-point was considered critical to achieving-success in product development and could not be taken lightly . for example , transitioning from the integration to the demonstration-phase requires a significant-investment to start building and testing production-representative-prototypes in a manufacturing-environment . this requires establishing a supplier base and purchasing-materials . in addition , establishing-tooling and manufacturing-capability is also required . after a product passes this decision-point and added-investments are made , the cost of making-changes to the product-design also increases significantly . therefore , commercial-companies strive to firm the design as early in the process as possible when it is significantly cheaper to make changes . we found that leading-commercial companies used two tools to capture knowledge that a product 's design was reliable and producible within cost , schedule , and quality-targets before making a production-decision . these tools are ( 1 ) a quality-concept that uses statistical-process-control to bring critical-manufacturing-processes under control so they are repeatable , sustainable , and consistently producing-parts within the quality-tolerances and standards of the product and ( 2 ) product-tests in operational conditions that ensure the system would meet reliability-goals-the ability to work without failure or need of maintenance for predictable-intervals . company-officials told us that these two tools enabled a smooth-transition from product development to production , resulting in better program-outcomes . companies employed these tools on production-representative-prototypes , making the prototypes a key-ingredient to successful-outcomes . table 5 shows the activities required to capture manufacturing-knowledge that leads to executive-decisions about whether to transition from product development into production . table 5 : activities to capture manufacturing-knowledge and make decisions activities to achieve manufacturing-knowledge • identify key-system-characteristics and critical-manufacturing-processes - key-product-characteristics and critical-manufacturing-processes are identified . because there can be thousands of manufacturing-processes required to build a product , companies focus on the critical-processes-those that build parts that influence the product 's key-characteristics such as performance , service-life , or manufacturability . • determine processes-in-control and capable - statistical-process-control is used to determine if the processes are consistently producing-parts . once control is established , an assessment is made to measure the process 's ability to build a part within specification-limits as well as how close the part is to that specification . a process is considered capable when it has a defect-rate of less than 1 out of every 15,152 parts produced . • conduct failure-modes and effects-analysis - bottom-up analysis is done to identify potential-failures for product-reliability . it begins at the lowest level of the product-design and continues to each higher tier of the product until the entire-product has been analyzed . it allows early-design-changes to correct potential-problems before fabricating-hardware . • set reliability-growth-plan and goals - a product's reliability is its ability to perform over an expected-period of time without failure , degradation , or need of repair . a growth-plan is developed to mature the product 's reliability over time through reliability-growth-testing so that it has been demonstrated by the time-production begins . • conduct reliability-growth-testing -reliability growth is the result of an iterative-design , build , test , analyze , and fix process for a product 's design with the aim of improving the product 's reliability over time . design flaws are uncovered and the design of the product is matured . • conduct executive-level-review to begin production - corporate-stakeholders meet and review relevant-product-knowledge , including-manufacturing and reliability-knowledge , to determine whether a product is ready to begin production . the decision is tied to the capture of knowledge . or manufacturability . therefore , when design-engineers are designing the new product , they must identify its key-characteristics so that manufacturing-engineers can identify and control critical-manufacturing-processes . key-product-characteristics and critical-manufacturing-processes are noted on the engineering-drawings and work-instructions that are released to manufacturing . once critical-processes are identified , companies perform capability-studies to ensure that a process will produce parts that meet specifications . these studies yield a process-capability-index ( cpk ) , a measure of the process 's ability to build a part within specified-limits . the index can be translated into an expected product-defect-rate . the industry-standard is to have a cpk of 1.33 or higher , which equates to a probability that 99.99 percent of the parts built on that process will be within the specified-limits . four of the five5-companies we visited wanted their critical-processes at a minimum of a 1.33 cpk and many had goals of achieving higher cpks . table 6 shows various-cpk-values and the defect-rate associated with each value . the table also shows the higher the cpk , the lower the defect-rate . table 6 : cpk index and probability of a defective-part cpk values also have an additive-effect on various-individual parts when each part is integrated into the final-product . for example , a product composed of 25 parts , where each part is produced on a manufacturing-process with a cpk of 0.67 , has a 95.5 percent-probability that each part will be defect free . however , when all 25 parts are assembled into the final-product , the probability that the final-product will be defect free is only 32 percent . in comparison , if the same parts are produced with manufacturing-processes at a cpk of 1.33 , the probability of each part being defect free is 99.99 percent . when these same 25 parts are assembled into the final-product , the probability that the final-product will be defect free is 5 the fifth-company wanted its critical-manufacturing-processes at a minimum of 1 cpk . 99.8 percent . this comparison illustrates the impact that having manufacturing-processes in control has on the amount of rework and repair that would be needed to correct defects and make the product meet its specifications . cummins uses statistical-process-control data to measure a product 's readiness for production . in developing the new signature 600-diesel-engine , cummins included-manufacturing-engineers and machine-tool and fixture-suppliers in the design-decision-process as the engine-concept was first being defined . cummins built production-representative-prototypes of its engines to demonstrate that the design and the engine-hardware would perform to requirements . these prototypes represented the first attempt to build the product solely using-manufacturing-personnel , production-tooling , and production-processes . cummins used the knowledge captured from these and subsequent-prototypes to refine and eventually validate the manufacturing-processes for the engine . this process of employing statistical-process-control techniques on prototype-engines verified that the manufacturing-processes were capable of manufacturing the product to high quality-standards within established cost and schedule-targets . other companies we visited emphasized the importance of controlling-manufacturing-processes before committing to production . for example , xerox captures knowledge about the producibility of its product early in the design-phase . by production , it strives to have all critical-manufacturing-processes for the product-including key-suppliers ' processes-in-control with a cpk index of at least 1.33 . xerox achieves this by building-production representative-prototypes and by requiring-suppliers of key-components and subassemblies to produce an adequate-sample of parts to demonstrate the suppliers ' processes can be controlled , usually before the parts are incorporated into the prototypes . general electric aircraft engines has digitally captured , and made available to design-engineers , cpk data on almost all of its manufacturing-processes and it strives to have critical-processes in control to a point where they will yield no more than 1 defect in 500 million parts , a cpk of 2.0 . other companies , such as caterpillar and hewlett packard , told us that getting-manufacturing processes-in-control prior to production is key to meeting-cost , schedule , and quality-targets . each of the companies visited used this as an indicator of the product 's readiness for production and emphasized the importance of having critical-manufacturing-processes under control by the start of production . demonstrating-product-reliability indicates the product is ready for production a product is reliable when it can perform over a specified-period of time without failure , degradation , or need of repair . reliability is a function of the specific-elements of a product's design . making-design-changes to achieve reliability-requirements after production begins is inefficient and costly . reliability-growth-testing provides visibility over how reliability is improving and uncovers design-problems so fixes can be incorporated before production begins . in general , reliability-growth is the result of an iterative-design , build , test , analyze , and fix process . prototype-hardware is key to testing for reliability-growth . initial-prototypes for a complex-product with major technological-advances have inherent deficiencies . as the prototypes are tested , failures occur and , in fact , are desired so that the product 's design can be made more reliable . reliability improves over time with design-changes or manufacturing-process-improvements . the earlier this takes place , the less impact it will have on the development and production program . companies we visited matured a product 's reliability through these tests and demanded-proof that the product would meet the customer 's reliability-expectations prior to making a production-decision . improvements in the reliability of a product 's design can be measured by tracking a key-reliability metric over time . this metric compares the product 's actual-reliability to a growth-plan and ultimately to the overall-reliability-goal . several commercial-companies we visited began gathering this data very early in development and tracked it throughout development . the goal was to demonstrate the product would meet reliability-requirements before starting full-rate-production . caterpillar establishes a plan to grow and demonstrate the product 's reliability before fabrication of a production-representative-prototype begins . before caterpillar starts making parts , it estimates the product 's reliability in its current-stage of development based on knowledge captured from failure-modes and effects analysis,6 component prototype-testing , and past-product experience . this information marks the starting point for the product 's reliability-growth-plan and is the basis for assessing whether the plan is achievable by production . if caterpillar believes the risks are too 6-failure-modes and effects-analysis is a bottom-up-approach to failure-identification . it should begin at the lowest level of the product-design . through analysis potential-failure-modes are identified allowing early-design-change to correct potential-problems before fabricating hardware-a more cost-effective-time to identify and fix problems . page 41 gao-02-701 best-practices executive-level-reviews are conducted to begin production high and the goal can not be achieved on time , decision-makers assess trade-offs between new and existing-components to reduce the risks to a more manageable-level . trade-offs might be made if the product 's performance still fails to meet requirements . if trade-offs are not possible , decision-makers may decide not to go forward with the development . once caterpillar has established this plan , it tracks demonstrated reliability against it as a management-tool to measure progress . it sets an interim-reliability-milestone and expects to be at least halfway toward the expected goal by the time it begins to build production-units . caterpillar has learned from experience that it will achieve the full-reliability-goal by full-production if it meets the interim-goal by the time it produces pilot-production-units . if the reliability is not growing as expected , then decisions about changing or improving the design must be addressed . caterpillar improves the product 's reliability during development by testing-prototypes , uncovering-failures , and incorporating-design-changes . according to caterpillar officials , the production-decision will be delayed if they are not on track to meeting their reliability-goal . these officials told us that caterpillar maintains the philosophy of first getting the design right , then producing it as quickly and efficiently as possible . they emphasized that demonstrating-reliability before production minimized the potential for costly-design-changes once the product is fielded . the commercial-companies , after capturing specific-manufacturing-knowledge , had executive-level-reviews to determine if the product development had sufficiently progressed to permit a transition into production . executives used the knowledge captured as exit-criteria for the transition . for example , to demonstrate the product was ready for production , critical-processes had to be in control and testing should have demonstrated the product-reliability . if the design-team could not satisfy the exit-criteria , then other options had to be considered . the production-decision led to increased-investments for materials and resources such as additional-tooling to build the product at a planned-rate , facilities , people , training and support . when dod-programs more closely approximated best-practices , outcomes were better our analysis of dod-programs showed that those more closely approximating best-practices had better outcomes . the f/a-18 e/f fighter and the aim-9x missile were based extensively on predecessor-programs and employed similar-tools to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge at critical-program-junctures . these programs had demonstrated a significantly higher degree of design-stability prior to entering-system-demonstration and committing to initial-manufacturing when compared to other dod weapon-programs in our review . they also gained-control of most of their manufacturing-processes and demonstrated that the products were reliable before entering-production . the success of these programs is best demonstrated by the fact that they have been close to meeting-cost , schedule , and performance-objectives . on the other hand , the pac-3 missile , f-22 fighter , and atircm/cmws programs did not use these best-practices . these programs were not based on predecessor-products or evolutionary in nature , and each product 's full-capability was expected in one step , with the first product off the production-line . with this daunting-task , these programs failed to demonstrate a stable-design before committing to initial-manufacturing , causing-quality and labor-problems . these programs also had much less knowledge about the manufacturability of their design when they entered-production . as a result , they experienced significant-increases in development-costs and production-delays usually at the expense of other dod-programs . details on the five dod-programs follow . aim-9x missile-program the aim-9x development-practices closely paralleled best-practices used by the commercial-companies we visited . the program achieved-design stability before moving into system-demonstration by incorporating mature-technologies and components from other missiles and munitions , using-engineering-prototypes to demonstrate the design , holding a series of design-reviews prior to the system-level critical-design-review , and completing and releasing 95 percent of the engineering-drawings at that time . figure 6 shows the building of knowledge required to achieve a stable-design on the aim-9x . figure 6 : achieving-stability on aim-9x missile-program by knowledge-point 2 source : gao 's analysis . the aim-9x program made extensive-use of engineering-prototypes to stabilize the missile 's design before building-production representative-prototypes . program-officials stated that testing of engineering-prototypes uncovered-problems with missile-design and manufacturing tooling early in the development , during system-integration , allowing-time to re-design and re-test in follow-on configurations . according to program-officials , this not only helped stabilize the design before entering initial-manufacturing but grew-system-reliability and reduced total-ownership-costs . the program also held design-reviews for each of the major-subsystems , allowing the program to achieve and demonstrate a stable-design in july 1999 , before beginning initial-manufacturing of production-representative-prototypes . while the aim-9x used statistical-process-control only to a limited-extent , other factors have allowed it to have a more successful-production-outcome to date . program-officials took-steps to ensure that manufacturing-aspects of the product were included in the design , including empowering a product-leader with a manufacturing-background , identifying the key-characteristics and critical-manufacturing-processes early , making-design-trade-offs to enhance manufacturing-capability , and demonstrating a robust-design to make the product less vulnerable to variations in manufacturing-process . in addition , the ability to achieve design-stability at the critical-design-review allowed program-officials to focus the system-demonstration-phase on maturing the manufacturing-processes . prior to committing to production , the program demonstrated that the product could be efficiently f/a-18 e/f program built using-production-processes , people , tools , and facilities to build prototypes . according to the former-program-manager , these steps gave the officials-knowledge that a reliable-product could be produced within cost and schedule-targets prior to entering-production . to date , the aim-9x program has largely met its production-targets . the f/a-18 e/f aircraft development-program was able to take advantage of knowledge captured in developing and manufacturing prior-versions of the aircraft . this evolutionary-approach significantly contributed to the cost and schedule-successes of this program . because the f/a-18 e/f was a variant of the older f/a-18 aircraft , the developer had prior-knowledge of design and manufacturing-problems . this knowledge , coupled with the use of modeling and computer-aided-design-software , helped create a design that was easier to manufacture . while the program did not fully use each of the best-practices , it did embrace the concepts of capturing-design and manufacturing-knowledge early in the program . during the program 's critical-design-review , about 56 percent of the drawings were completed and , while the program did not meet the best practice of 90 percent complete , it did have additional drawing-data of the f/a-18 e/f assemblies available for review at the critical-design-review . the navy used early-versions of the f/a-18 aircraft to demonstrate new component-designs and new materials . in addition , the aircraft was designed to have 42 percent fewer parts than its predecessor , making its design more robust . the program also identified the critical-manufacturing-processes and collected statistical-process-control data early in product development . at the start of production , 78 percent of these critical-processes were in control . unit-costs for the f/a-18 e/f program have not grown since the critical-design-review and its schedule has been delayed by only 3 months . f-22 fighter program the f-22 program is structured to provide the product 's full-capability with the first product off the production-line-an extreme-design-challenge . this required the product-design to include many new and unproven-technologies , designs , and manufacturing-processes . it did not demonstrate-design stability until about 3 years after it held its critical-design-review . the program completed 3,070 initial-engineering-drawings at its critical-design-review in 1995 , about 26 percent of the eventual-drawings needed . it did not complete 90 percent of the necessary engineering-drawings until 1998 , after the first two development aircraft were delivered . figure 7 shows the drawing-completion history for the program . figure 7 : history of drawing-completion for the f-22 program source : gao 's analysis . after its critical-design-review , the f-22 program encountered several-design and manufacturing-problems that resulted in design-changes , labor-inefficiencies , cost-increases , and schedule-delays . for example , delivery of the aft fuselage-the rear-aircraft-body section-was late for several of the test-aircraft and two ground test-articles because of late-parts and difficulties with the welding-process . according to the f-22 program-office , design-maturity and manufacturing-problems caused a `` rolling-wave '' effect throughout system-integration and final-assembly . late-engineering drawing-releases to the factory-floor resulted in parts-shortages and work performed out of sequence . these events contributed to significant-cost-overruns and delays to aircraft-deliveries to the flight-test-program . the f-22 program initially had taken steps to use statistical-process-control data during development and gain control of critical-manufacturing-processes by the full-rate-production decision . in 1998,7 we reported that the program had identified 926 critical-manufacturing-processes and had almost 40 percent in control 2 years before production was scheduled to begin . although this did not match the standard set by commercial-companies , it offered major-improvements over what other dod-programs had attempted or achieved . unfortunately , citing budgetary-constraints and specific hardware quality problems that demanded-attention , the program abandoned this best-practices approach in 2000 with less than 50 percent of it critical-manufacturing-processes in control . currently , the program is using post-assembly-inspection to identify and fix defects rather than statistical-process-control techniques to prevent them . in march 2002,8 we recommended that the f-22 program-office monitor the status of critical-manufacturing-processes as the program proceeds toward high rate-production . the program stated that it would assess the processes-status as the program moves forward . the program entered limited-production despite being substantially behind its plan to achieve reliability-goals . a key-reliability requirement for the f-22 is mean-time between maintenance , defined as the number of operating-hours for the aircraft divided by the number of maintenance-actions . the reliability-goal for the f-22 is a 3-hour mean-time between maintenance . the air force estimated that in late 2001 , when the f-22 entered limited-production , it should have been able to demonstrate almost 2 flying-hours between maintenance-actions . however , when it actually began limited-production it could only fly an average of 0.44 hours between maintenance-actions . in other words , the f-22 is requiring significantly more maintenance-actions than planned . additionally , the program has been slow to fix and correct-problems that have affected reliability . to date , the program has identified about 260 different types of failures , such as main landing gear tires wearing out more quickly than planned , fasteners being damaged , and canopy-delaminating . it has identified fixes for less than 50 percent of these failures . ideally , the design-fixes for the failures should be corrected prior to manufacturing-production-units . 7 u.s. general-accounting-office , best-practices : successful-application to weapon acquisition requires changes in dod's environment

( washington , d.c. : mar . 5 , 2002 ) . page 47 gao-02-701 best-practices pac-3 missile-program the pac-3 missile did not achieve design-stability until after the building of production-representative-prototypes for system-demonstration began . at the program 's critical-design-review , the pac-3 program had completed 980 engineering drawings-21 percent of the eventual-drawings needed for the missile . since then , almost 3,700 more drawings have been completed . the total number of drawings expected to represent the completed design grew from about 2,900 at the critical-design-review to almost 4,700 as of july 2001 . this uncertainty in the expected-drawings not only indicates that the design was not stable when initial-manufacturing began but also shows that there was a significant-lack of knowledge about the design . figure 8 shows the design-knowledge at the critical-design-review , when the decision was made to commit to initial-manufacturing of the missile . figure 8 : pac-3 design-knowledge at critical-design-review source : gao 's analysis . prototypes of the product-design were not built before the critical-design-review or before initial-manufacturing started to show that the design would work . therefore , because of the immature-design , initially manufactured-development-missiles were hand-made , took longer to build than planned , and suffered from poor-quality . as a result , many design and manufacturing-problems surfaced during system-demonstration . subsystems did not fit together properly , and many failed-ground and environmental-tests the first time . the contractor attributed $ 100 million of additional-cost to first time manufacturing-problems . prior to entering limited-production in 1999 , the program had less than 40 percent of the critical-manufacturing-processes in control for assembling the missile and the seeker . according to program-officials , there was little-emphasis during development or initial-production on using statistical-control on critical-manufacturing-processes . most of the development-missiles were built in specialty-shops rather than in a manufacturing-environment . the result was a lack of knowledge about whether the critical-manufacturing-processes could produce the product to established cost , schedule , and quality-targets . this uncertainty is reflected in contractor-estimates that more than 50 percent of the time charged to build the initial-production-missiles will be for engineering-activities . actual-production-labor is expected to account for about 30 percent of the charged time . to further understand the problems on the pac-3 program , we focused on its seeker-subsystem , which is key to acquiring and tracking-targets and represents a large-percentage of the missile's cost . currently , despite being in production , it is unclear whether the supplier of the seeker can produce it within cost , schedule , and quality-targets . during development , the supplier had difficulty in designing and manufacturing this subsystem . it was not uncommon for seekers to be built , tested , and reworked seven or eight times before they were acceptable . the program entered-production , despite these producibility-issues . now , even with 2 years of production-experience , the supplier continues to have difficulty producing the seeker with acceptable-quality . data provided by the supplier in october 2001 showed that less than 25 percent of the seekers were being manufactured properly the first time and the rest had to be reworked , on average , four times . atircm/cmws program according to program-officials , atircm/cmws did not have a stable-design until about 2 years after the critical-design-review . a contributing-factor to this was a lack of understanding about the full-requirements for the new system at the critical-design-review in 1997 . this led to a major-redesign of the common missile warning system 's sensor . at the critical-design-review , only 21 percent of a product's engineering-drawings had been completed . it did not complete 90 percent-drawings-the best-practice-until 1999 . the immature-design caused inefficiencies in manufacturing , rework , and delayed deliveries . in addition , between 1995 and 1999 , the development-contract target price increased by 165 percent . the atircm/cmws program did not begin reliability-growth-testing until 4 years after its critical-design-review , leaving only 1 year to test the system prior to scheduled-production . program-officials said that an immature-design limited their ability to begin reliability-testing earlier in development . about one-third of the way through the reliability-growth test program , testing was halted because too many failures occurred in components such as the power-supply , the high voltage electrical-system , and the cooling-system . according to a program-official , the inability to demonstrate system-reliability contributed to a production-delay of about 1 year . the program plans to build , develop , and test six additional development-units during 2002 and 2003 that will incorporate design-changes to fix the system-failures . atircm/cmws plans to enter limited-production in the early-part of 2002 with significantly less knowledge about the design 's producibility than commercial-companies . the contractor does not use statistical-process-control and has not identified critical-manufacturing-processes . a production-readiness-review identified the lack of statistical-process-control as a major-weakness that needs to be corrected . chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge the department of defense 's ( dod ) acquisition-policy9 establishes a good-framework for developing-weapon-systems ; however , disciplined-adherence , more specific-criteria , and stronger acquisition-incentives are needed to ensure the timely-capture and use of knowledge in decision-making . dod changed its acquisition-policy to emphasize evolutionary-acquisition and establish separate-integration and demonstration-phases in the product-development-process . its goal was to develop higher quality-systems in less time and for less cost . however , dod 's acquisition-policy lacks detailed-criteria for capturing and using-design and manufacturing-knowledge to facilitate better decisions and more successful-acquisition-program outcomes . as demonstrated by successful-companies , using these criteria can help ensure that the right-knowledge is collected at the right-time and that it will provide the basis for key-decisions to commit to significant-increases in investment as product development moves forward . while the right-policy and criteria are necessary to ensure a disciplined , knowledge-based product-development-process , the incentives that influence the key-players in the acquisition-process will ultimately determine whether they will be used effectively . in dod , current-incentives are geared toward delaying knowledge so as not to jeopardize program-funding . these incentives undermine a knowledge-based-process for making-product-development decisions . instead , program-managers and contractors push the capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge to later in the development-program to avoid the identification of problems that might stop or limit its funding . they focus more on meeting-schedules than capturing and having the knowledge necessary to make the right-decisions at those milestones . such an approach invariably leads to added costs because programs are forced to fix problems late in development . by contrast , commercial-companies must develop high-quality-products quickly or they may not survive in the marketplace . because of this , they encourage their managers to capture product-design and manufacturing-knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development , before making significant-increases in their investment . instead of a scheduledriven-process , their process is driven by events that bring them 9 dod directive 5000.1 , the defense acquisition-system ( oct. 23 , 2000 ) , dod instruction 5000.2 , operation of the defense acquisition-system ( apr . 5 , 2002 ) , and dod regulation 5000.2-r , mandatory procedures for major defense acquisition-programs ( mdaps ) and major automated information-system ( mais ) acquisition-programs ( apr . 5 , 2002 ) . page 52 gao-02-701 best-practices chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge acquisition-policy lacks specific-implementation criteria knowledge : critical-design-reviews that are supported by completed engineering-drawings and production-decisions that are supported by reliability-testing and statistical-process-control data . they do not move forward without the design and manufacturing-knowledge needed to make informed-decisions . greater emphasis on evolutionary-acquisitions and structuring the product-development-process into two phases-system-integration and system demonstration-were-good first steps for dod to achieve its goals of buying higher quality-systems in less time and for lower costs . however , dod policy still lacks criteria to be used to capture specific-design and manufacturing-knowledge and does not require the use of that knowledge as exit-criteria at key-decision-points to transition from system-integration to system-demonstration and then into production . in three of the five dod program-examples in chapter 3 , managers decided to move forward in development , even when developers had failed to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge to support increased-investments . as a result , these programs encountered significant-increases in acquisition-costs as well as delays in delivering-capabilities to the war-fighter . table 7 illustrates key-criteria used by commercial-companies that are currently lacking in dod 's policy . the table shows the design and manufacturing-knowledge needed to make more informed-decisions . the capture of some of the important-manufacturing and reliability-knowledge should begin in the integration-phase in order to have the full-knowledge needed to make decisions at the end of the demonstration-phase for transitioning into production . chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge table 7 : analysis of dod acquisition-policy for inclusion of best-practices for knowledge-based design and manufacturing decisions according to dod 's current-acquisition-policy , the system-integration-phase of an acquisition normally begins with the decision to launch a program . the policy-states that , during this phase , a system 's configuration should be documented and the system should be demonstrated using-prototypes in a relevant-environment . while these are noteworthy-activities and resemble best-practices , the policy does not provide criteria for what constitutes the level of knowledge required for completing this stage , nor does it require a decision-based on those criteria-as to whether a significant , additional-investment should be made . commercial-companies-demand knowledge from virtual or engineering-prototypes , 90 percent of required engineering-drawings for the product supported by test results , demonstration that the product meets customer-requirements , a series of disciplined-design-reviews , and stakeholder-agreement that the design is stable and ready for product-demonstration before a commitment is made to move forward and invest in product-demonstration . under dod 's revised policy , it is still difficult to determine if a product should enter product-demonstration with a stable-design . chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge dod 's current-acquisition-policy also states that the system-demonstration-phase begins after prototypes have been built and demonstrated in a relevant-environment during system-integration . according to the policy , a system must be demonstrated before the department will commit to production . the low-rate initial-production decision occurs after this phase of product development . like the end of system-integration , the policy fails to provide specific-criteria for what constitutes the knowledge required to support the decision to move into production . for example , the policy-states there should be `` no significant-manufacturing-risks '' but does not define what this means or how it is measured . without criteria for building-knowledge during the demonstration-phase , the production-decision is often based on insufficient-knowledge , creating a higher probability of inconsistent-results and cost and schedule-problems . on the other hand , commercial-companies-demand proof that manufacturing-processes are in control and product-reliability goals are attained before committing to production . with more specific-knowledge in hand at the end of development , decision-makers can make a more informed-decision to move into production with assurances that the product will achieve its cost , schedule , and quality-outcomes . finally , while dod 's policy separates product development into a two-stage-process-integration and demonstration-it does not require a decision-milestone to move from one stage to the next . the policy-states that an interim-progress-review should be held between the two stages , but the review has no established agenda and no required outputs of information unless specifically requested by the decision-maker . its purpose is to confirm that the program is progressing as planned . on the other hand , commercial-companies consider this review a critical-decision-point in their product-development-process because it precedes a commitment to significantly increase their investment . therefore , they use specific , knowledge-based-standards and criteria to determine if the product is ready to enter the next-phase and they hold decision-makers accountable for their actions . these decision-reviews are mandatory and are typically held at the executive-level of the commercial-firm . figure 9 illustrates the commercial-model for knowledge to be captured and delivered during product-integration and product-demonstration and the possible-application of that model to dod's acquisition-process . without a similar-decision review to bring accountability to the dod process , acquisition-programs can-and do-continue to advance into system-demonstration without a stable-design . as shown in our case chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge studies , this provides for a high probability of cost-growth and schedule-delays to occur . figure 9 : illustration to show how the best practice-model would apply to dod 's acquisition-process source : gao 's analysis . chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge incentives in the dod acquisition-environment do not favor-capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge early enough the incentives for program-managers and product-developers to gather knowledge and reduce risk are also critical to dod 's ability to adopt best-practices for product development . in dod , incentives are centered on obtaining scarce-funding on an annual basis in a competitive-environment to meet predetermined and typically optimistic-program-schedules . these incentives actually work against the timely-capture of knowledge , pushing it off until late in the process to avoid problems that might keep a program from being funded . because design and manufacturing-knowledge is not captured , key-decision-points intended to measure and ensure that a weapon-system has sufficiently matured to move forward in the process-risk becoming unsupported by critical-knowledge . in leading-commercial companies , the opposite is true . because companies know they have to deliver high-quality-products quickly and affordably , they limit the challenge for their program-managers and provide strong-incentives to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge early in the process . program-managers are empowered to make informed-decisions before big-investments in manufacturing-capability are required . dod 's current-acquisition-environment is driven by incentives to make decisions while significant-unknowns about the system 's design and manufacturability persist . this environment-results in higher risks and a greater reliance on cost-reimbursement10-contracts for longer periods of time during product development . because events that should drive key-decisions , such as critical-design-reviews , interim-progress-reviews , and production-decision-reviews , are based on inadequate-design and manufacturing-knowledge , they do not support-decisions to invest more and move to the next-phase of the acquisition-process . nevertheless , this approach has proven effective in securing-funds-year to year . for example , the f-22 , pac-3 , and atircms/cmws programs had less than one-third of their engineering-drawings completed at their critical-design-review , but each obtained the funding necessary to move onto the initial-manufacturing of production-representative-prototypes . that funding allowed a significant-increase in investment to develop a manufacturing-capability before critical 10 cost-reimbursement-contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred-costs , to the extent prescribed in the contracts . they are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract-performance , such as research and development-work , do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient-accuracy . in contrast , fixed-priced-contracts , except those subject to price-adjustment , provide for a preestablished-firm-price , place-maximum-risk and full-responsibility for all costs and resulting-profit or loss on the contractor , and provide maximum-incentive for the contractor to control-costs and perform effectively . chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge knowledge had been captured . the incentive to capture funding for the program was greater than the incentive to wait , capture knowledge , and reduce the risk of moving forward . each of these programs encountered significant-cost-increases and schedule-delays . the incentives are quite-different for leading-commercial companies . for them , the business-case-centers on the ability to produce a product that the customer will buy and that will provide an acceptable-return on investment . if the firm has not made a sound-business-case , or has been unable to deliver on one or more of the business-case-factors , it faces a very real-prospect of failure-the-customer may walk away . also , if one product development takes more time and money to complete than expected , it denies the firm-opportunities to invest those resources in other products . for these reasons , commercial-companies have strong-incentives to capture product-knowledge early in the process to assess the chances of making the business-case and the need for further investments . production is a dominant-concern in commercial-companies throughout the product-development-process and forces-discipline and trade-offs in the design-process . this environment encourages realistic-assessments of risks and costs since doing otherwise would threaten the business-case and invite failure . for the same reasons , the environment places a high value on knowledge for making-decisions . program-managers have good-reasons to identify risks early , be intolerant of unknowns , and not rely on testing late in the process as the main-vehicle for discovering the performance-characteristics of the product . by adhering to the business-case as the key to success , program-managers in leading-commercial companies are conservative in their estimates and aggressive in risk-reduction . ultimately , adherence to the business-case strengthens the ability to say `` no '' to pressures to accept high risks and unknowns . practices such as prototyping , early manufacturing and supplier-involvement , completing 90 percent of engineering-drawings by critical-design-review , demonstrating-product-reliability , and achieving statistical-control of critical-manufacturing-processes by production are adopted because they help ensure success . in dod 's current-acquisition-environment , the customer is willing to trade time and money for the highest performing-weapon system possible . that willingness drives the business-case . this creates strong-incentives for the program-office to take significant-risks with technologies and designs to ensure it can offer the customer a weapon-system that is a quantum-leap above the competition . in addition , because funding is secured on an chapter 4 a better match of policy and incentives is needed to ensure capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge annual basis in dod , strong-incentives exist for the program-office to make optimistic-assumptions about development-cost and schedule . because the customer is willing to wait and funding is never certain , an environment exists where program-managers have good-reasons to avoid the capture of knowledge and delay testing . since the business-case in dod-places very little-premium on meeting-cost and schedule-targets , but a very high premium on performance , programs succeed at the point where sunk costs make it difficult-if not prohibitive-for-decision-makers to cancel them . the practices commercial-companies use to capture knowledge are not currently used in this environment because the business-case does not favor them . instead , dod 's product-development-environment relies on cost-type-contracting throughout the entire-product development-process . once in production , programs will cut quantities to maintain funding or once fielded , they rely on the operations and maintenance-budget to pay for reliability-problems not solved in development . chapter 5 conclusions and recommendations the department of defense 's ( dod ) planned $ 700 billion investment in conclusions weapon-systems over the next 5 years requires an approach that keeps cost , schedule , and performance risks to a minimum . this approach means adopting and implementing an evolutionary-approach to developing new weapon-systems , improving-policy to more closely approximate a knowledge-based product-development-process , and creating-incentives for capturing and using-knowledge for decision-making . without an evolutionary-approach as its foundation , the ability to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge early in the development-process is significantly reduced . programs , in turn , take on too much new unproven-content to meet their objectives and risks invariably increase . dod has made improvements in its acquisition-policy by incorporating-guidance for evolutionary-acquisition , creating-guidelines for the development of a basic-product that can be upgraded with additional-capabilities as technologies present themselves . however , evolutionary-acquisition has yet to be consistently implemented with success on individual weapon-system-acquisitions . regardless of whether dod emphasized greater-use of evolutionary-acquisition , acquisition-programs are not capturing sufficient-design and manufacturing-knowledge to make good-decisions at key investment-points . the current-policy establishes a good-framework to develop a product , but the policy still lacks specific-criteria required to move a program forward and does not tie knowledge to decisions for increasing-investments in the program as it moves from system-integration to system-demonstration . as a result , programs often pass through each development-phase and into production with an unstable-design and insufficient-knowledge about critical-manufacturing-processes and product-reliability . this results in greater likelihood for inconsistent and poor-results and cost and schedule-problems later in the program . additionally , dod does not provide the proper-incentives to encourage the use of best-practices in capturing-knowledge early in its development-programs . currently , managers are focused more on the annual-exercise of obtaining-funding needed to keep their programs viable and alive . the importance of capturing-design and manufacturing-knowledge early gives way to the pressures of maintaining-funding , often resulting in the acceptance of greater risks . raising-problems on a program early because design and manufacturing-knowledge is discovered can cause extra-oversight and questions that threaten a system 's survival . the prevailing recommendations for executive action culture is to accept greater risks upfront and then fix problems later in the development-program . we found that leading-commercial companies over the years had found ways to overcome these problems and had identified best-practices that resulted in the early-capture of and use of design and manufacturing-knowledge . this was done by a combination of four key-elements . first , they established and used an evolutionary-approach to develop products that made the capture of design and manufacturing-knowledge a more manageable-task . this framework limited the design-challenge for any one new product development by allowing risky-technology , design , or manufacturing-requirements to be deferred until a future-generation of the product . dod 's current-policy addresses this ; however , it has not had sufficient-time to show how this will be implemented . second , each company we visited used the same basic-product development-process and criteria for bringing together and integrating all of the technologies , components , and subsystems required for the product to ensure the design was stable and then demonstrating that the product was producible and reliable using proven manufacturing-processes . dod 's policy lacks the criteria to measure-design-stability and process-controls . third , successful-companies used-tools to capture design and manufacturing-knowledge about the product and decide about whether to invest further based on that knowledge . their new product-development-process included key , high-level-decision-points before moving into product-demonstration , and again before making the production-decision that required specific , knowledge-based-exit-criteria . dod 's policy does not require a decision to move from system-integration to system-demonstration . finally , leading-companies created an environment for their managers that emphasized capturing-design and manufacturing-knowledge early , before committing substantial-investments in a product development that made cancellation a more difficult-decision to make . dod 's environment encourages meeting schedule milestones instead of capturing-design and manufacturing-knowledge to make decisions . dod should take steps to close the gaps between its current-acquisition-environment and best-practices . to do this , it should ensure that its acquisition-process captures specific-design and manufacturing-knowledge , includes decisions at key-junctures in the development-program , and provides incentives to use a knowledge-based-process . such changes are necessary to obtain greater predictability in weapon-system page 61 gao-02-701 best-practices programs ' cost and schedule , to improve the quality of weapon-systems once fielded , and to deliver new capability to the war-fighter faster . more specifically , we recommend that the secretary of defense : • require the capture of specific-knowledge to be used as exit-criteria for decision-making at two key-points-when-transitioning from system-integration to system-demonstration and from system-demonstration into production . the knowledge to be captured when moving from system-integration into system-demonstration should include the following : • completed subsystem and system-design-reviews . • ninety percent of drawings completed . • demonstration that design meets requirements-prototype or variant-testing . • stakeholders ' ( cross functional-design-team that includes design-engineers , manufacturing , key-supplier ) assurance that drawings are complete . • completed-failure-modes and effects-analysis . • identification of key-system-characteristics . • identification of critical-manufacturing-processes . • set reliability-targets and growth-plan . the knowledge to be captured when moving from system-demonstration into production should include the following : • demonstrated manufacturing-processes . • built production-representative-prototypes . • tested prototypes to achieve reliability-goal . • tested prototypes to demonstrate product in operational-environment . • collected statistical-process-control data . • demonstration that critical-processes are capable and in control . • require that the interim-progress-review , currently identified in dod 's policy as that point in the process between system-integration and system-demonstration , be a mandatory decision-review . at this point , the design should be demonstrated to be stable so that during the next-phase of development-attention can be focused on demonstrating-manufacturing-processes and product-reliability . the program-manager should have proof-based on the exit-criteria for moving out of system-integration in the above recommendation-that the product-design is stable . the exit-criteria should be demonstrated and verified by the program-manager before the program can make the substantial-investments needed to begin manufacturing production-representative-prototypes in the next-phase of development-system-demonstration . to ensure visibility of demonstrated-exit-criteria to decision-makers , the criteria and the program 's status in achieving them should be included in each program 's defense acquisition executive-summary and selected acquisition reports . if the program does not meet the exit-criteria , investments should be delayed until such time as the criteria are satisfied . to proceed without completing the required demonstrations should require approval by the decision authority . • expand exit-criteria for the milestone c decision to include the knowledge to be captured during the system-demonstration-phase as identified in recommendation one . this will require that the program-office demonstrate that the critical-manufacturing-processes are under statistical-control and that product-reliability has been demonstrated before entering-production of the new weapon-system . these are best-practices and indicate that the product-design is mature and the program is ready to begin production of units for operational-use that will meet the cost , schedule , and quality-goals of the program . • to ensure that contracts support a knowledge-based-process , we further recommend that dod structure its contracts for major-weapon-system acquisitions so that ( a ) the capture and use of knowledge described in recommendation one for beginning-system demonstration is a basis for dod 's decision to invest in the manufacturing-capability to build initial-prototypes and ( b ) the capture and use of manufacturing and reliability-knowledge discussed in recommendation one for moving from system agency-comments and our evaluation demonstration to production is a basis for dod 's decision to invest in production . dod concurred with a draft of this report and agreed with the benefits of using-design and manufacturing-knowledge to make informed-decisions at key-points in a system-acquisition-program . dod had some comments with regard to the details contained in the recommendations , which are summarized below . dod concurred with our recommendation to add exit-criteria at two key-points in the acquisition-process-when transitioning from system-integration to system-demonstration and from system-demonstration into production . dod believes , however , that the milestone decision authority needs to retain flexibility in applying the knowledge-requirement for drawings . flexibility and judgment are management-prerogatives that should exist in any decision-process . we agree there may be circumstances , such as in the development of software , when it makes good-sense to progress with less than the best practice-standard for drawings , but the dod policy should maintain the requirement to achieve 90-percent-drawings by the completion of the system-integration-phase . dod also concurred that critical-manufacturing-processes must be demonstrated using statistical-process-control techniques before production , but believes that achieving this at milestone c , the low-rate production-decision , is unlikely . it believes the criteria would be better applied to the full-rate-production decision or when low-rate production quantities extend beyond 10 percent of the planned weapon-system buy . this is a reasonable-approach when processes are new or unique . however , not all critical-processes will be new or unique to a specific-weapon-system . some will have been used to manufacture parts or components for other systems or products . at a minimum , it should be possible to demonstrate these by milestone c. for other critical-processes that may require additional-production-experience to bring under statistical-process-control , a program-manager should have a reasonable-plan at the milestone c decision-review to bring those processes into control by the full-rate-production decision , but no later than completion of 10 percent of the planned-buy . appendix i comments from the department of defense appendix ii
