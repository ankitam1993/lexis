program-lodges spirit december 20 , 2002 snow has been falling regularly for several weeks , heartening those wishing for a traditional white christmas . carols are playing just about everywhere as shoppers hit-stores for their annual holiday-gift-buying . tradition and feelings of good-will are big this time of the year . and a group of local-lawyers has been doing its best this week to add to a goodwill-tradition of its own : providing free legal-service to people facing-eviction just before the holidays . billed as `` home for the holidays , '' the four-day-project marked its third-year in syracuse city court last week . `` there have been a lot of kids this year , '' legal-services of central new york executive director dennis kaufman said . one woman he represented was facing-eviction with her three children , and a second woman had four children and a fifth on the way . `` tenants not represented by attorneys normally get evicted . when tenants have vigorous-representation , the outcome is much-different , '' legal-services-lawyer lewis liebler said wednesday as he joined about six other lawyers doing pro-bono-work . across four days , lawyers from legal-services and the frank h. hiscock legal-aid society , along with a number of private-lawyers - six of them from the mackenzie hughes firm on one day - working through the onondaga county-bar-association 's volunteer lawyer project , offered-assistance to people who went before city judge jeffrey merrill . about three dozen-cases , involving 123 people facing-eviction , were handled , according to volunteer lawyer project-director barbara romeo . romeo said the lawyers prevented 13 evictions , had two others dismissed and one other put off until after the holidays for a trial . seventeen-evictions were delayed , giving-families additional-time to find new housing , romeo said . and in three other cases , the lawyers were not able to get extensions but were able to avert judgments against the tenants . heather stimpson and her son , 7 , were facing an eviction proceeding wednesday when she was introduced to liebler . the landlord was claiming-stimpson owed $ 2,750 in back rent , but stimpson told liebler she was planning to move out anyway because of the poor-condition of her west belden avenue residence . with liebler 's help , stimpson was given until dec. 29 to move . the landlord was not awarded any money . `` i think it 's great , '' stimpson said of the free legal-service when she returned to court thursday with a friend who was facing-eviction from another of the same landlord 's properties . `` it 's a lot better than having to get myself out before christmas , '' she said . liebler on thursday also helped larry bell keep his columbus avenue residence through the holidays and into the new year . bell had recently been approved to have the federal government subsidize part of his monthly-rent , but the government 's portion of the december rent was going to be delayed until january , and the landlord was reluctant to wait . liebler explained the situation in court and the landlord , who had already received bell 's portion of the december rent , agreed to wait for the government 's portion . `` i get to keep my place , '' bell said , adding that without counsel , he would n't have known what to say in court and would have lost the case . about half of the people on the court 's eviction-calendar failed to show up , kaufman said , noting those people unfortunately miss out on the free legal-help being offered . one of the private-lawyers offering her help wednesday was edwina schleider , whose regular-law-practice involves representing landlords in similar-matters . `` this makes me feel very good coming here and doing this , '' she said , noting she regularly volunteers her services to tenants at eviction-court once a month .
