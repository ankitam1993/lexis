the florida times-union saturday , may 25 , 2002 legal-aid in clay county could get a boost r. michael anderson people who are most in need of a lawyer 's help in clay county often are the ones who can least afford it . that 's when jacksonville area legal-aid inc. steps in to fill the gap . but even though legal-aid-lawyers provide legal-services to thousands of indigent-clients in northeast florida , including-hundreds a year in clay county , the needs of many others go unmet due to budgetary-constraints and staffing-limitations . with only one lawyer and one paralegal in its clay county branch office in green cove springs , the non-profit-agency handled more than 300 cases last year , said michael figgins , executive director . but for every client who received help fighting-negligent landlords , abusive-husbands or federal-benefit-program administrators , four others did not . `` study after study shows unmet-needs to be about 80 percent , '' he said . the ability to handle more cases is about to take a big-jump , however , as a result of an increase in revenue from fees charged for every civil-action filed in court in clay county . the county commission has endorsed a request to boost the filing-fee from $ 10 to $ 25 and could approve an ordinance as early as tuesday to implement the fee-hike . `` currently , we spend about $ 250,000 a year in clay county , which is about 8 percent of our budget , '' said figgins , adding that clay county clients also represent about 8 percent of the total `` poverty-population '' served by legal-aid last year in duval , baker , nassau and clay counties . the additional-revenue from higher court-filing-fees will total about $ 60,000 a year , of which approximately $ 40,000 will be spent on salary for an additional-lawyer to assist gloria einstein , who has been the only legal-aid-lawyer in clay county for many years . the only way to get a lawyer so cheaply will be to find one with limited-experience , or perhaps one fresh out of law-school with a strong-desire to `` provide justice to low-income-people , '' figgins said . legal-aid handles only civil-cases . child-custody and domestic-violence-cases , housing-discrimination , divorce , consumer-fraud and social-security and medicare entitlements make up the majority of the agency 's case-load . the last time court-filing-fees were increased in clay county to help fund the program was in 1998 , when commissioners approved an increase from $ 5 to $ 10 . of the more than 300 legal-aid-cases in clay last year , roughly 40 percent involved-women who had been abused by violent-husbands and were seeking-divorces , figgins said . most of the women were referred to legal-aid by quigley house , clay county 's sexual assault and domestic-violence-center . in domestic-violence-situations involving married-clients , the victims need to legally sever their marital-relationship with their abusive-spouses in order to move on with their lives , figgins said , and jacksonville area legal-aid provides the expertise to accomplish that . sharon youngerman , executive director of quigley house , said about 75 percent of the women who come to her agency in search of help have children . but most have no financial-resources , which is why so many remain in abusive-situations for years . `` everyone asks why does she stay in the abusive-situation , '' youngerman said . `` well , if she ca n't get a divorce she does n't have any kind of legal-paperwork that would require him to support her [ and their children ] . '' the services legal-aid provides , she said , are critical to helping indigent-victims of domestic-violence achieve the freedom they need to start their lives over and begin to recover from years of physical and psychological-trauma . `` very few of our clients have the financial-resources to do this on their own , '' youngerman said . `` generally , if they had the resources they do n't need shelter and they can afford private counseling .
