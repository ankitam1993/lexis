the clarion ledger march 18 , 2002 domestic-violence-aid offered program pays for needed legal-help in abusive-situations by sherri williams clarion-ledger staff writer domestic-violence-victims needing legal-help can get it through a program launched by central southwest mississippi legal-services corp . the domestic-violence legal-assistance-program fills the gap of legal-resources for domestic-violence-survivors who ca n't afford an attorney . domestic-violence-survivors in jackson , vicksburg , hattiesburg , oxford and pascagoula can all get help . julia crockett , deputy director of central southwest mississippi legal-services corp. , said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic-violence-victims . crockett said legal-help gives domestic-abuse-survivors a way to rebuild their lives . `` they have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything , so when they come to us they are desperate , '' she said . `` those who need legal-help and do n't get it feel totally lost . because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation . '' crockett said the program , funded by a $ 300,000 grant from the u.s. justice department , has no economic-restrictions on who can get help . legal-services typically helps the poor . gladys bunzy , who said she was in an abusive-relationship with a boyfriend for eight years , said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent-relationships . `` when i finally made up my mind to leave , i had a restraining-order put against him and that was $ 50 but that was $ 50 well spent to me , '' said bunzy , 40 . `` for people who ca n't afford it , this will be a godsend ... if a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind , if the law will help her keep that person away from her . '' gwen bouie-haynes , project-director of the domestic-violence services center for catholic-charities inc. , said often-domestic violence-survivors do not have the money to seek legal-representation . `` legal-assistance is a major-issue for women fleeing a domestic-violence situation , '' she said . `` often-times-women are in need of immediate legal-assistance-services for the protection of the mother and the child . to get a protective-order you need to be represented by an attorney . '' crockett said the pilot-program was launched in 1998 at the haven house family shelter inc. , a domestic-violence-shelter for women and children in vicksburg . the program has helped victims in 90-court-cases , and 150 legal-counseling-sessions have been held there . lark johnson , executive director at the shelter , said some of the women would never have received legal-help had it not been for the program . `` in the past , they would have had to report their spouse's income and that would be included in determining whether they were eligible to get legal-help , whether they had access to that money or not , '' she said . `` they can get help now with no barriers for custody-cases , protective-orders and other things . '' johnson said through the program her shelter , which served 187 women and children last year , has been able to form better relationships with those who work with domestic-violence-victims . `` judges and law-enforcement-officers are trained to help them understand what their options are to stabilize a violent-home , '' johnson said . `` they are also trained to detect evidence of domestic-violence in a home . so they wo n't have to solely rely on the testimony of the victim . '' educating-court and law-enforcement-officers is a program priority , crockett said , because in that emotional and painful situation `` sensitivity and education is absent '' among some who deal with victims . for details about the domestic-violence legal-assistance-program , call 601-948-6752 .
