times union albany , ny tuesday , may 14 , 2002 legal-aid society ensures justice for needy arthur j. siegel the times union coverage of law day quoted chief-judge judith s. kaye as saying , `` the promise of freedom and equal-justice is an empty one if our justice-system is not accessible . '' unfortunately , there was no mention of the capital region 's own legal-aid society of northeastern new york , the nonprofit-organization that works to ensure that justice is available to the poor , the disabled and the endangered members of our community . lasnny is one of the oldest and most cost-effective legal-services-organizations in the united states . originally incorporated in 1923 as the legal-aid society of albany , it now serves income- eligible-clients in eight counties throughout the capital region . lasnny provides only needed civil legal-aid -- urgent , noncriminal-assistance to low-income-people . last year , the lasnny helped more than 14,000 people . funding for legal-aid preserves community-resources and saves tax-dollars . for example , in 2001 , lasnny : opened 585 cases for the victims of domestic-violence , helping to break the cycle of violence that causes so much lasting-harm to women and children . prevented or forestalled 112 evictions , saving-shelter-costs of $ 151,619 and the disruption that families suffer when they are displaced . won 87 ssi/ssd cases enabling-clients to receive $ 850,016 in retroactive-benefits , saving-state-taxpayers $ 441,786 and enabling people with disabilities to live with dignity . because we lack sufficient-public and private-support , the dedicated-attorneys and staff at lasnny are limited in their ability to serve all those in need . as a result , an estimated four out of five low-income-people requiring legal-help in our community do not receive it . our elected-officials , and all who are concerned about providing equal-access to justice for all , must step forward and support legal-aid-services . if not , many of our neighbors will continue to be denied the protection of the laws and freedoms we cherish and promote throughout the world .
