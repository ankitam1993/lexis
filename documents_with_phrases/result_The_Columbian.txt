the columbian tuesday , june 11 , 2002 washington state-legal-aid program challenge reaches u.s. high court paul queary , associated press writer olympia -- the u.s. supreme court agreed monday to hear a washington case challenging the widespread-practice of pooling client-money held by lawyers and using the interest to pay for legal-services for the poor . a washington supreme court rule issued in 1984 requires lawyers to put clients ' money in a pooled-account if the amount is too small or will be held for too short a time to earn interest for the individual-client . the rule was later expanded to include real-estate-closing offers . the interest from the pooled-money adds up to about $ 6 million per year statewide . it goes to the legal foundation of washington , which doles it out to 34 legal-aid-agencies around the state . the washington legal foundation a washington , d.c. , organization that defends private-property-rights sued in federal court in 1997 to overturn the practice . the foundation argues the practice essentially steals the interest from the clients , an illegal-taking of personal-property under the fifth amendment to the u.s. constitution . `` no one person suffers an awful-lot , '' said richard samp , the foundation 's chief-counsel . `` but it 's a small amount of money that 's stolen from a lot of people . '' similar-programs called iolta , or interest on lawyers ' trust-accounts exist in all 50 states so the case could have broad impact . advocates argue that the program is an important-source of legal-help for poor-people forced to deal with civil legal-matters including domestic-violence protection-orders , child-custody-fights and eviction-disputes . `` we only can help-right now about one out of five people who ask for help , '' said barbara clark , executive director of the legal foundation of washington . `` the potential-loss of this funding is very devastating . '' iolta contributes 38 percent of the money available for low- income civil legal-assistance in washington , clark said . advocates also argue that interest is essentially created by the program because taxes and accounting-costs would eat away the money if lawyers tried to set up a similar-program to benefit the clients . but samp argues that iolta-programs essentially discourage lawyers from setting up such pooled-accounts that might benefit their clients . a u.s. district-court initially dismissed the washington case , but a three-judge-panel of the 9th u.s . circuit-court of appeals overturned the ruling . then the full 9th circuit overruled its own justices in the state 's favor , agreeing with the state 's contention that the clients were n't harmed because the interest would n't be earned otherwise .
