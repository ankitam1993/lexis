testimony gao before the subcommittee on oversight of government-management , restructuring , and the district of columbia committee on governmental affairs , u.s. senate gao/t-ggd-00-26 statement management-reform : elements of successful-improvement-initiatives mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee : we are pleased to be here today to contribute to the subcommittee 's ongoing-efforts to identify ways to improve the management and performance of the federal government . as you know , last january we issued a new volume of reports , the performance and accountability series , outlining the major-management-challenges confronting our largest federal-agencies and the substantial opportunities for improving their performance.1 many of the challenges discussed in that series represent long-standing , difficult , and complex-problems that our work has shown will not be easily or quickly resolved . in fact , implementing and sustaining major-change-initiatives requires a cultural-transformation for many agencies . therefore , given the magnitude of the problems an agency may face , and the extensive-effort and long period of time it can take before problems are fully resolved , progress must often be measured initially in terms of whether the agency has a well thought out management-improvement-initiative in place to guide its reform-efforts . as agreed with the subcommittee , this morning we will discuss the elements that our wide-ranging-work on federal-management issues suggests are particularly-important in implementing and sustaining management-improvement-initiatives that genuinely take root and eventually resolve the problems they are intended to fix . these elements are ( 1 ) a demonstrated leadership-commitment and accountability for change ; ( 2 ) the integration of management-improvement-initiatives into programmatic-decisionmaking ; ( 3 ) thoughtful and rigorous-planning to guide decisions , particularly to address human-capital and information-technology-issues ; ( 4 ) employee-involvement to elicit ideas and build commitment and accountability ; ( 5 ) organizational-alignment to streamline operations and clarify-accountability ; and ( 6 ) strong and continuing congressional-involvement . not surprisingly , the elements of successful management-improvement-initiatives that we will discuss today are consistent with the approaches shared by performance-based-management-efforts under the government-performance and results act ( results act ) and quality-management that we discussed in our july 29 , 1999 , statement for this subcommittee.2 our statement-today is based on our broad-body of work and resulting-knowledge of management-issues , including our examination of the implementation of the results act and related initiatives , our reviews of selected national partnership for reinventing 1maj or management-challenges and program-risks ( gao/ocg-99-set , january 1999 ) . 2 management-reform : using the results act and quality-management to improve federal-performance ( gao/t-ggd-99-151 , july 29 , 1999 ) . page 1 gao/t-ggd-00-26 demonstrated leadership-commitment and accountability for change government ( npr ) recommendations , and our ongoing-analyses of agency-specific-improvement-efforts , such as the internal revenue service ( irs ) modernization . perhaps the single most important-element of successful management-improvement-initiatives is the demonstrated commitment of top-leaders to change . this commitment is most prominently shown through the personal-involvement of top-leaders in developing and directing-reform-efforts . organizations that successfully address their long-standing-management-weaknesses do not `` staff out '' responsibility for leading-change . top-leadership-involvement and clear-lines of accountability for making-management-improvements are critical to overcoming-organizations ' natural-resistance to change , marshalling the resources needed in many cases to improve management , and building and maintaining the organizationwide commitment to new ways to doing business . commissioner rossotti 's efforts at irs provide a clear-example of leadership 's commitment to change . the commissioner has articulated a new mission for the agency , together with support for strategic-goals that balance-customer service and compliance with tax laws.3 moreover , the commissioner has initiated a modernization effort that touches virtually every aspect of the agency , including business-practices , organizational-structure , management-roles and responsibilities , performance-measures , and technology . commissioner rossotti has assigned clear-executive-ownership of each of irs ' major-initiatives and is using-executive-steering committees to provide oversight and accountability for driving the change-efforts . sustaining top-leadership-commitment to improvement is particularly-challenging in the federal government because of the frequent-turnover of senior-agency political-officials . as a result , sustaining-improvement-initiatives requires commitment and leadership by senior-career-executives , as well as political leaders . career-executives can help provide the long-term-focus needed to institutionalize reforms that political-executives ' often more limited-tenure does not permit . in addition , the other elements of successful management-improvement-initiatives that we shall turn to shortly are important for institutionalizing-reform initiatives . 3 irs ' new mission-statement reads , `` provide america 's taxpayers top-quality-service by helping them understand and meet their tax-responsibilities and by applying the tax-law with integrity and fairness to all . '' irs ' supporting strategic-goals are to ( 1 ) provide top-quality-service to each taxpayer , ( 2 ) provide service to all taxpayers by applying the law with integrity and fairness , and ( 3 ) increase-productivity by providing a quality-work environment for its employees . page 2 gao/t-ggd-00-26 integration of management-improvement-initiatives into programmatic-decisionmaking traditionally , the danger to any management-reform is that it can become a hollow , paper-driven-exercise where management-improvement-initiatives are not integrated into the day-to-day-activities of the organization . thus , successful-organizations recognize-and implement reform-efforts on the basis-of-the essential-connection between sound-management and the programmatic results those organizations hope to achieve . the results act provides a ready-made-statutory-mechanism for making this essential-connection , engaging congress in a discussion of how and when management-problems will be addressed , and helping to pinpoint additional-efforts that may be needed . we have found that annual-performance-plans that include precise and measurable-goals for resolving mission-critical-management-problems are important to ensuring that agencies have the institutional-capacity to achieve their more resultsoriented programmatic-goals . moreover , by using annual-performance-plans to set-goals to address management-weaknesses , agencies provide themselves and congress with a vehicle-the subsequent agency-performance reports-for tracking-progress in addressing-management-problems and considering what , if any , additional-efforts are needed . unfortunately , we found that agencies do not consistently address major-management-challenges and program-risks in their fiscal year 2000 performance plans.4 in those cases where challenges and risks are addressed , agencies use a variety of approaches , including setting-goals and measures directly linked to the management-challenges and program-risks , establishing-goals and measures that are indirectly related to the challenges and risks , or laying out strategies to address them . figure 1 shows the distribution of the 24 agencies covered by the chief financial-officers act and their different-approaches to addressing management-challenges and program-risks in their annual-performance-plans . 4 managing for results : opportunities for continued-improvements in agencies ' performance-plans ( gao/ggd/aimd-99-215 , july 20 , 1999 ) . page 3 gao/t-ggd-00-26 figure 1 : approaches used to address management-challenges and program-risks note : numbers do not add up to 100 percent due to rounding . source : gao analysis based on agencies ' fiscal year 2000-performance-plans . irs has important-management-reform initiatives underway to address long-standing-management-weaknesses , but it missed the opportunity to demonstrate these actions in its portion of the department of the treasury 's fiscal year 2000-performance-plan . for example , the department of the treasury 's plan has no goals , measures , or strategies to address several of the high-risk-areas5 we have identified at irs , including • internal-control-weaknesses over unpaid-tax-assessments ( we found that the lack of a subsidiary-ledger impairs irs ' ability to effectively manage its unpaid-assessments . this weakness has resulted in irs inappropriately directing-collection-efforts against taxpayers after amounts owed have been paid . ) ; • the need to assess the impact of various-efforts irs has under way to reduce filing-fraud ; • the need to improve security-controls over information-systems and address weaknesses that place sensitive-taxpayer-data at risk to both internal and external-threats ( our high-risk-update reported that irs' 5 these areas are characterized as `` high-risk '' because of their greater vulnerability to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement . page 4 gao/t-ggd-00-26 controls do not adequately reduce vulnerability to inappropriate-disclosure . ) ; and • weaknesses in internal-controls over taxpayer-receipts . similarly , the general services administration 's ( gsa ) fiscal year 2000 annual-performance-plan does not address several long-standing-problems identified by the gsa inspector-general . these problems include top-management 's lack of emphasis on ensuring that the internal-controls are in place to deter fraud , waste , and abuse . gsa 's plan also does not fully address-issues raised by the inspector-general related to developing new management-information-systems and ensuring that automated information-systems have the proper-controls and safeguards . these omissions are significant because gsa 's governmentwide-oversight and service-provider-role , its extensive-interaction with the private sector , and the billions of taxpayer-dollars involved in carrying out its activities , make it especially-important that gsa 's operations be adequately protected . thoughtful and rigorous-planning to guide decisions the magnitude of the challenges that many agencies face in addressing their management-weaknesses necessitates substantive planning be done to establish ( 1 ) clear-goals and objectives for the improvement-initiative , ( 2 ) the concrete management-improvement steps that will be taken , ( 3 ) key-milestones that will be used to track the implementation-status , and ( 4 ) the cost and performance-data that will be used to gauge overall-progress in addressing identified weaknesses . our work across the federal government has found the effective-use of human-capital and information-technology-both separately and , importantly , as they relate to one another-are-areas where thoughtful and rigorous-planning is needed if fundamental management-improvements are to be made . for example , we looked at the efforts of four agencies ( the departments of agriculture , health and human-services , interior , and veterans affairs ) to both improve services and reduce staffing-levels in their personnel-offices through the better application of information technology.6 the agencies planned to increase operating efficiencies and improve services by automating-paper-based personnel-processes . the agencies expected that new hardware and/or software-technology would reduce paperwork and workload , thereby permitting sizable-staff-reductions . however , the agencies made the staffing-reductions before much of the new automation was in place , and automation-efforts had not been fully implemented as of 6 management-reform : agencies ' initial-efforts to restructure personnel operations ( gao/ggd-98-93 , july 13 , 1998 ) . page 5 gao/t-ggd-00-26 late 1997 . as a result , the agencies were struggling to achieve their efficiency and service-improvement-objectives . on a more positive-note , we recently reviewed the efforts of three agencies ( the postal-service , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , and the park-service ) to more strategically manage their facilities and assets by forming-business-partnerships with the private sector.7 in each of the six partnerships that we reviewed , the agency built the expertise to engage in the partnership and make it successful . for example , the department of veterans affairs established a separate organizational-unit staffed with professionals experienced in management , architecture , civil engineering , and contracting to manage its partnerships . with regard to planning for major-technology-projects , irs has historically lacked disciplined and structured-processes for developing and managing-information-technology . we reported in february 1998 that irs had not clearly defined system-modernization phases , nor had it adequately specified organizational-roles , making it unclear who was to do what.8 irs ' systems-modernization challenges include completing a modernization-blueprint to define , direct , and control future modernization-efforts and establishing the management and engineering-capability to build and acquire modernized-systems . the key to effectively addressing these challenges is to ensure that long-standing-modernization-management and technical-weaknesses are corrected before irs invests large sums of modernization-funds . as we have reported , irs recently initiated appropriate first steps to address these weaknesses via its initial modernization expenditure plan that represents the first step in a longterm , incremental modernization program.9 the census-bureau , through its effective-use of technology in expanding the electronic-availability of census-data , demonstrates how federal-agencies can leverage-performance and customer satisfaction through the better use of technology . before applying-technology to its data-dissemination-efforts , the bureau released massive-amounts of data in printed reports . now , by using the internet as its principal-medium for disseminating-data , the bureau is able to reduce its reliance on printed 7 public-private-partnerships : key-elements of federal buildings and facility-partnerships ( gao/ggd-99-23 , feb. 3 , 1999 ) . 8 tax systems-modernization : blueprint is a good-start but not yet sufficiently-complete to build or acquire systems ( gao/aimd/ggd-98-54 , feb. 24 , 1998 ) . 9 tax systems-modernization : results of irs ' initial expenditure plan ( gao/aimd/ggd-99-206 , june 15,1999 ) . page 6 gao/t-ggd-00-26 employee-involvement to elicit ideas and build commitment and accountability materials , reach a wider audience , and provide its clients with information in a format that better meets their needs . the bureau reports that its customers are responding positively to the shift , with significant growth in the number of customer-hits on the census internet-site , from about 10,000 per day in 1994 to more than 850,000 per day in 1999 . the bureau plans to use the internet as its principal-medium for releasing-data from the 2000 census . successful management-improvement-efforts require the active-involvement of managers and staff throughout the organization to provide ideas for improvements and supply the energy and expertise needed to implement changes . employees at all levels of high-performing-organizations participate in -- and have a stake in -- improving operational and program-performance to achieve results . our work has shown that high-performing-organizations use a number of strategies and techniques to effectively involve employees , including ( 1 ) fostering a performanceoriented-culture , ( 2 ) working to develop a consensus with unions on goals and strategies , ( 3 ) providing the training that staff need to work effectively , and ( 4 ) devolving-authority while focusing accountability on results . fostering a performance-oriented-culture requires agency-management to communicate with staff throughout the organization to involve them in the process of designing and implementing-change . setting-improvement-goals is an important-step in getting organizations across the government to engage seriously in the difficult-task of change . the central-features of the results act-strategic-planning , performance-measurement , and public reporting and accountability-can serve as powerful-tools to help change the basic-culture of government . involving-employees in developing and implementing these goals and measures can help direct a diverse-array of actions to improve performance and achieve results . however , our survey of federal-managers , conducted in late 1996 and 1997 , indicates there is substantial-room for improvement in this area . this survey found that only one-third of non-ses managers ( as opposed to nearly-three-fourths of the ses managers ) reported they had been involved in establishing-long-term strategic-goals for their agencies.10 employees in high-performing-organizations understand the importance of and the connection between their performance and the organization's 10 the government-performance and results act : 1997 governmentwide implementation will be uneven ( gao/ggd-97-109 , june 2 , 1997 ) . page 7 gao/t-ggd-00-26 11 success . the failure to constructively involve staff in an organization 's improvement-efforts means running the risk that the changes will be more difficult and protracted than necessary . for example , in the fall of 1997 , the nuclear regulatory commission's ( nrc ) office of inspector-general surveyed nrc staff to obtain their views on the agency 's safety-culture . in its june 1998 report , the inspector-general noted that the staff had a strong-commitment to protecting public health and safety but expressed high levels of uncertainty and confusion about the new directions in regulatory-practices and challenges facing the agency . employees who are confused about the direction their agency is taking will not be able to effectively focus on results or make as full a contribution as they might otherwise . one way high-performing-organizations can enhance employee-involvement and gain agreement on an organization 's goals and strategies is by developing-partnerships with employee-unions . the u.s . postal-service 's long-standing-challenges in labor-management-relations illustrate the importance of having a shared-set of long-term-goals and strategies agreed upon by managers , employees , and unions . as we have reported , labor-management-relations at the postal-service have been characterized by disagreements that have , among other things , hampered efforts to automate some postal-systems that could have resulted in savings and helped the service reach its performance goals.12 although there has been some progress , problems persist and continue to contribute to higher mail-processing and delivery-costs . to help the postal-service resolve its problems , we have long recommended that the service and its unions and management-associations establish a framework agreement to outline common-goals . we have also noted that the results act can provide an effective-framework for union and management-representatives to discuss and agree upon goals and strategies . employees ' capabilities also play an important role in achieving performance-improvements , and training is a key-factor enabling employee-involvement . agencies that expect their employees to take greater responsibility and be held accountable for results must ensure that the employees have the training and tools they need to fulfill these expectations . in that regard , irs is beginning to implement significant-changes that will require training for frontline-employees and their supervisors . for example , in lieu of hiring a large number of seasonal 11 major-management-challenges and program-risks : a governmentwide-perspective ( gao/ocg-99-1 , january 1999 ) . 12 major-management-challenges and program-risks : u.s . postal-service ( gao/ocg-99-21 , january1999 ) . page 8 gao/t-ggd-00-26 employees to handle return-processing workload during the annual filing-season , irs plans to increase the number of permanent employees and expand their job-responsibilities to include compliance-work that they can do after the filing-season . those employees will have to be cross-trained so that they can handle both their return-processing and compliance-responsibilities . training is expected to be a key-factor in irs ' efforts to provide top-quality-customer-service . further , given the dynamic environment-agencies face , employees need incentives , training , and support to help them continually learn and adapt . our 1996/97 survey found that about 60 percent or more of the supervisors and managers reported that their agencies had not provided them with the training necessary to accomplish critical , results-oriented-management tasks . high-performing-organizations also seek to involve and engage employees by devolving-authority to lower levels of the organization . employees are more likely to support changes when they have the necessary-amount of authority and flexibility -- along with commensurate-accountability and incentives -- to advance the agency 's goals and improve performance . allowing-employees to bring their expertise and judgement to bear in meeting their responsibilities can help agencies capitalize on their employees' talents , leading to more effective and efficient-operations and improved customer service.13 some federal-agencies , such as the social-security administration ( ssa ) , are exploring new ways to involve employees by devolving-decisionmaking authority . although the efficacy of this initiative has not been fully assessed , ssa has been implementing a pilot-program to establish a `` single decision-maker '' position . this program expands the authority of disability-examiners , who currently make initial-disability determinations jointly with physicians , and allows the single decision-maker to make the initial-disability-determination and consult with physicians only as needed.14 our work has shown that agencies can improve the extent to which they devolve authority for employees to make decisions and the extent to which they hold employees accountable for results . our 1996/97 survey of federal-managers found that less than one-third of non-ses managers felt that to a great or very great-extent they had the decisionmaking-authority needed to accomplish strategic-goals . likewise , only about half of the managers we 13 executive-guide : effectively implementing the government-performance and results act ( gao/ggd-96-118 , june 1996 ) . ssa disability redesign : actions needed to enhance future progress ( gao/hehs-99-25 , mar . 12,1999 ) . page 9 gao/t-ggd-00-26 surveyed reported that they were being held accountable for program-results . our work has also shown that agencies can do a better job of providing-incentives to encourage employees to improve performance and achieve results . only one-fourth of non-ses managers reported that to a great or very great-extent-employees received positive recognition from their agencies for efforts to help accomplish strategic-goals . at the request of this subcommittee , we are surveying federal-managers again to follow up on whether there have been improvements in these critical-areas . some agencies have explored new ways of devolving-decisionmaking authority in exchange for operational-flexibility and accountability for results . for example , in fiscal year 1996 , the veterans health administration ( vha ) management-structure was decentralized to form 22 veterans integrated-service networks.15 va gave these networks substantial operational-autonomy and the ability to perform basic-decisionmaking and budgetary-duties . va made the networks accountable for results such as improving-patient access , efficiency , and reducing-costs . va also established-performance-measures , such as increasing the number of outpatient surgeries , reducing the use of inpatient-care , and increasing the number of high-priority-veterans served to hold network and medical-center directors accountable for results . organizational-alignment to streamline operations and clarify-accountability successful management-improvement-efforts often-entail organizational-realignment to better achieve results and clarify-accountability . for example , gsa has sought to improve its efficiency and effectiveness by changing its organizational-structure to separate its policymaking-functions from its operations that provide services . gsa recognized that it suffered from conflicting-policymaking and service-providing-roles and needed to replace its outmoded-methods of delivering-service . to address this issue , gsa established the office of policy , planning , and evaluation in 1995 , which it later renamed the office of governmentwide-policy , to handle policy-decisions separately from functions that deliver supplies or services . gsa believes that this realignment has improved efficiency and reduced the perception of conflict of interest that existed prior to the separation of its policymaking and service-delivery-roles . while gsa 's efforts thus far are an important-reform , additional-opportunities for organizational-realignment appear to exist . for example , 15 va health care : more veterans are being served , but better oversight is needed ( gao/hehs-98-226 , aug. 28 , 1998 ) . page 10 gao/t-ggd-00-26 the gsa inspector-general has expressed concerns that gsa's organization and management-structure has not kept pace with gsa's downsizing , streamlining , and reform-efforts . in addition , the inspector-general has said that gsa 's organizational-structure does not seem to match the responsibility for managing-programs with the authority to do so . as a result , for example , gsa has faced situations where regions ( which operate independently ) have taken divergent-positions on similar-issues , according to the inspector-general . irs ' ongoing-efforts provide another example of the importance of aligning organizational-structures . as commissioner rossotti has stated , irs ' current cumbersome organizational-structure and inadequate-technology are the principal-obstacles to delivering dramatic-improvements in customer service and productivity . the commissioner is reorganizing irs with the aim of building an organization designed around taxpayer-groups and creating management-roles with clear-responsibilities . one of the first organizational-realignments taking place is in the office of the taxpayer-advocate . this office is intended to , among other things , help taxpayers who can not get their problems resolved through normal irs channels . formerly , the advocate 's office had to rely on functional-groups within irs , like examination and collection , to provide most of its program resources-including-staff , space , and equipment.16 when functional-needs conflicted with advocate office needs , there was no assurance that advocate needs would be met . in the new organization , all advocate-program-resources will be controlled and managed by the taxpayer-advocate . by organizing this way , irs hopes to improve both program-efficiency and service to taxpayers . the organizational-realignments at gsa and irs are consistent with a more general-exploration under way to use streamlined and clarified organizational-arrangements to help enhance accountability and improve performance . for example , building on reform-efforts in the united kingdom and other countries , the administration has proposed creating-performance-based organizations ( pbos ) in which selected-agencies that deliver measurable-services receive greater organizational-autonomy in exchange for heightened accountability for results on the part of top and senior-leadership . last year , in an attempt to address significant-management and accountability-problems with federal student financial-aid-programs , congress enacted the first pbo , the office of student financial-assistance , within the department of education . we have irs management : irs faces challenges as it restructures the office of the taxpayer-advocate ( gao/ggd-99-124 , july 15 , 1999 ) . page 11 gao/t-ggd-00-26 identified the management of student financial-aid-programs , with more than $ 150 billion in outstanding-student-loans , as being at high-risk to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement . the pbo structure exemplifies new directions in accountability for the federal government because the pbo 's chief-operating-officer , who reports to the secretary of education , is held directly and personally-accountable , through an employment-contract , for achieving measurable organizational and individual-goals . the chief-operating-officer is appointed by the secretary of education to a minimum 3-year and a maximum 5-year term , and may receive a bonus for meeting the performance-goals or be removed for failing to meet them . the office of student financial-assistance was provided with increased flexibility for procurement and personnel-management , and key-managers are to be held directly-accountable for performance-objectives that include ( 1 ) improving-customer-satisfaction ; ( 2 ) providing-high-quality costeffective-services ; and ( 3 ) providing complete , accurate , and timely-data to ensure program-integrity . the chief-operating-officer is to enter into annual-performance-agreements containing measurable-organization and individual-goals with key-managers , who can receive a bonus or can also be removed . an additional-accountability-mechanism is that the chief-operating-officer and the secretary of education are required to agree on , and make public , a 5-year performance-plan that establishes the office 's goals and objectives . to further underscore accountability-issues , the pbo 's chief-operating-officer is to annually prepare and submit to congress , through the secretary , a report on the performance of the pbo . the report is to include an evaluation of the extent to which the office met the goals and objectives contained in the 5-year performance-plan . in addition , the annual report is to include ( 1 ) an independent financial-audit , ( 2 ) applicable financial and performance-requirements under the chief financial-officers act and the results act , ( 3 ) the results achieved by the office relative to its goals , ( 4 ) an evaluation of the chief-operating-officer 's performance , ( 5 ) recommendations for legislative and regulatory-changes to improve service and program-integrity , and ( 6 ) other information as detailed by the director of the office of management and budget . page 12 gao/t-ggd-00-26 strong and continuing congressional-involvement finally , congress plays a crucial-role in management-improvement-efforts throughout the executive-branch through its legislative and oversight-capacities . on a governmentwide-basis , congress , under the bi-partisan-leadership of this committee and the house government-reform committee , has established a statutory-framework consisting of requirements for goal-setting and performance-measurement , financial-management , and information-technology-management , all aimed at improving the performance , management , and accountability of the federal government . through the enactment of the framework and its efforts to foster the framework's implementation , congress has , in effect , served as an institutional champion for improving the management of the federal government , providing a consistent-focus for oversight and reinforcement of important-policies . on an agency-specific-basis as well , support from the congress has proven to be critical in instituting and sustaining-management-reforms , such as those taking place at irs , gsa , and elsewhere across the federal government . congress , in its oversight-role , can monitor management-improvement-initiatives and provide the continuing-attention necessary for reform-initiatives to be carried through to their successful-completion . information in agencies ' plans and reports produced under the results act , high quality financial and program-cost data , and other related-information , can help congress in targeting its oversight-efforts and identifying-opportunities for additional-improvements in agencies ' management . in this regard , we have long advocated that congressional-committees of jurisdiction hold augmented-oversight-hearings on each of the major-agencies at least once each congress . congress could examine , for example , the degree to which agencies are building the elements of successful management-improvement-initiatives that we have discussed-today into their respective management-reform efforts . such hearings will further underscore for agencies the importance that congress places on creating high-performing-government-organizations . also , through the appointment and confirmation-process , the senate has an added opportunity to make clear its commitment to sound federal-management and explore what prospective-nominees plan to do to ensure that their agencies are well-managed and striving to be high-performing-organizations . in summary mr. chairman , serious and disciplined-efforts are needed to attack the management-problems confronting some of our largest agencies . successful management-improvement-efforts often contain a number of common critical-elements , including-top leadership-commitment and accountability , the integration of management page 13 gao/t-ggd-00-26 improvement-initiatives into programmatic-decisions , planning to chart the direction the improvements will take , employee-involvement in the change-efforts , organizational-realignment to streamline operations and clarify-accountability , and congressional-involvement and oversight . experience has shown that when these elements are in place , lasting-management-reforms are more likely to be implemented that ultimately lead to improvements in the performance and cost-efficiency of government . mr. chairman , this concludes our prepared-statement . we would be pleased to respond to any
