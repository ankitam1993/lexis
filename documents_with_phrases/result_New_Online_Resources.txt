chicago daily law bulletin new online resources available to legal-aid-attorneys adam w. lasker october 1 , 2002 a local-technology-center has opened the doors to a statewide internet-community for legal-aid-providers and pro-bono attorneys . the illinois technology-center for law & the public-interest launched two new web sites tuesday that will allow the state's legal-services-agencies to swap training-information , to maintain individual-listings of services and volunteer-opportunities and to schedule-events on an electronic-calendar . the itc , housed in chicago-kent college of law and funded in large part by the chicago bar-foundation , the lawyers trust-fund of illinois and legal-services corp. in washington , d.c. , developed the online-community in what is promised to be a userfriendly environment . `` we are replacing the older test-site with two dynamic database-driven-web-sites ... with content-management-system software , '' said itc executive director lisa a. colpoys . `` it sounds complex , '' she added , `` but it really allows nontechnical-people like me and other lawyers to add content directly to the web sites so they become a legal-aid-community online . '' contributors need only be able to use internet-browsers and basic-word-processing and email-programs , colpoys said . the sites , www.illinoislegalaid.org and www.illinoisprobono.org , include a list of more than 90-state-agencies , most of which provide direct legal-services to indigent-clients . staff-members at those agencies can update the online-information about the services they provide and they can add to an electronic-library of legal-information in 12 different-practice-areas -- without leaving their offices . `` we 're really relying on our legal-aid-partners across the state to build this legal-services-library , '' colpoys said . `` each practice-area contains information for attorneys to learn about that area of law so they can get training or support ... without having to go to the [ actual ] library . '' the itc has enlisted legal-services-attorneys from across the state to manage each of the 12 categories , and those volunteers will organize contributions and add them to a searchable-database . private-practice-attorneys looking for pro-bono-work can visit the illinoisprobono.org web site , which has a list of volunteer-opportunities from each of the agencies . the attorneys can search through that listbased on criteria including the location where the work needs to be done and the field of law in which it concentrates . `` it 's providing an avenue for increasing-communication through legal-interest-groups , and the organizations really have an opportunity to reach out to the general legal-community by posting volunteer-opportunities , '' colpoys said . anne stalder nelson , executive director of the cabrini green legal-aid-clinic in chicago , said the web sites will serve as a resource that previously would have come at significant-cost . `` as the director of a small legal-aid-clinic , this is huge for us -- it 's giving us access to resources we would n't otherwise be able to afford , '' nelson said . `` it 's coordinating legal-services in illinois in a way that has n't ever been done before . '' she expects the web sites will help promote smaller legal-aid-providers among the general legal-community , which will help attract more volunteer-attorneys . nelson , a member of the itc board of directors , also said the available-training-materials , the online-calendar and the message-boards will save a lot of time in getting new interns and volunteers up to speed . `` to the small legal-aid-providers , it helps us do our jobs much better so we can spend more of our time doing what 's important , '' nelson said . itc board member robert a. glaves is the executive director of the chicago bar-foundation , which provides funding to more than 40 local legal-aid-agencies , and he said the web sites will help those agencies run more efficiently . `` it 's going to reduce the duplication of efforts and it 's going to increase efficiency by increasing the communication among people doing similar-work , '' he said . `` the collective-knowledge comes together and saves them time that they can spend on their cases .
