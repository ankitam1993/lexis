chicago daily law bulletin april 17 , 2002 high court seeks higher registration-fees daniel c. vock law bulletin staff writer springfield -- registration-fees for illinois lawyers could jump as much as $ 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate-measures to bolster pro-bono-services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol-problems . the illinois supreme court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee-hikes to legal-services to the poor . the justices are floating a $ 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono-work , as the normal-funding mechanism for legal-services has fallen short in recent years . currently , support for non-profit legal-aid-groups comes from interest generated on the lawyers ' trust-fund , which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow-funds . but low-interest-rates and a sagging-economy mean there is less money being generated . after hours of discussion , the high court agreed that raising the registration-fees would be the best way to address the declining-revenues , chief-justice moses w. harrison ii said . the judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono-services was important enough `` and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute '' to the cause , harrison said . last year , the high court raised the base-fee for active-attorneys to $ 180 from $ 140 . lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive-pay $ 90 , and retired-lawyers pay nothing . legislation circulated by the high court 's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys `` paying full annual registration-fees . '' in 2001 , there were 57,392 active-attorneys in illinois and 74,311 on the full-roll , according to the attorney registration and disciplinary commission . the hike would raise roughly $ 2.4 million . last year , interest on the trust-fund totaled $ 4.5 million , but service and handling-fees consumed $ 538,000 of that amount . this year 's returns are projected to be anywhere between $ 700,000 and $ 1 million short of that mark , said ruth ann schmitt , the executive director of lawyers trust-fund of illinois . harrison said the fee-hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income , not add to the total-amount available . `` our legal-services are already stretched to the breaking-point , '' schmitt said . `` we have a tough-time raising enough-money to properly fund services that our clients need . '' neither the illinois state-bar-association nor the chicago bar-association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes . the court 's initiative is far from a done deal . the proposal has not been attached to any legislation currently-viable in either the house or senate . the court needs legislative-approval to set up a separate-state-account to deposit the money . that would mark a change from the way money earned through the interest on lawyer trust-account , or iolta , is handled . in fact , the high court once became embroiled in a dispute with the auditor-general 's office over whether the auditor could examine iolta funds because they were not in a state-account . on another front , the state 's largest two bar-associations are backing a measure to increase attorney-registration-fees by $ 7 to fund the lawyers ' assistance-program . that legislation , house bill 4078 , would also use a separate-state-account to collect the money . the lawyers ' assistance-program is designed to help lawyers with drug or alcohol-abuse-problems , or with mental-health-problems . the bill calling for the $ 7 increase passed the house but is currently stalled in the senate . the legislation must pass the hearing-stage by next thursday . legislation is available-online at www.legis.state.il.us .
