greedy and generous associates anthony perez cassino dec. 23 , 2002 a recent-review of my bookmarked-web-sites offered an interesting-contrast in sites geared towards associates . immediately following the site greedyassociates.com appeared the antithetically named site generousassociates.com . what , if anything , do these seemingly-polar opposite-sites have in common or even say about our profession ? do most of us identify with one or the other or are they just oversimplified-descriptions designed to attract associates surfing the web ? greedyassociates began as a forum for associates at primarily large-law-firms to vent and share information about salaries , bonuses and law-firm-gossip . prior to web sites and email , this type of information traveled by way of telephone -- usually from one law-school-classmate to another . the anonymous-message-board on greedyassociates has dramatically expanded that network , and now information about the latest salary-increase or layoffs is shared instantaneously with thousands of associates throughout the country . the site has grown beyond its original-format and now includes job-postings , legal-information and book-recommendations . however , the message-board remains one of its more compelling features . today , the postings often have less to do with `` greed '' and more about world-affairs , political-opinions and advice to young-associates and law-students . generousassociates is a washington , d.c.-based web site that enables lawyers to make a donation to the legal-aid society of d.c . the site sets forth information about the legal-aid society and the amounts donated by associates and area-law-firms . through the web site , a total of 1,634 associates donated nearly $ 200,000 to legal-aid in 2002 . in addition , area-law-firms contributed over $ 100,000 through matching-funds . it is a model for raising-money for legal-aid-programs that could , and should , be replicated throughout the country . as a frequent-visitor to each site , i believe that they reflect the complexity of being a lawyer and the challenges of juggling financial-success and public-service . although at first glance it might appear that they represent a clear-choice between selfishness and generosity , these two sites and the underlying-issues they address , are inextricably linked . the ultimate-success of generousassociates or any other cause supported by the legal-profession depends , in part , upon the financial-success of the lawyers and law-firms who support those causes . just as important , a program such as the one featured on generousassociates relies on the generosity of those same lawyers who may be more focused on the issues found at greedyassociates . as many firms have shown by their ranking at the top of the american lawyer survey in both profits and pro-bono , it is possible to do well and do good at the same time . this healthy-co-existence between `` greed '' and `` generosity '' has at times been lost on associates . the most glaring-example is in regard to the mixed-signals that associates may get concerning pro-bono . while some associates enjoy widespread-support from their firm for volunteering , others get the feeling that pro-bono-participation may be seen as evidence of a lack of interest in a law-firm-career . a brief-review of the pro-bono messages posted on greedyassociates reveals the depth of the disparity . one associate who obviously had a positive-association with pro-bono implored others to `` take on some pro-bono matters . there 's no reason to have nothing to do when there 's an endless-amount of pro-bono-work out there and maybe you will get a chance to learn something that you would n't get a chance to otherwise . '' those comments were echoed by another individual who advised first years that `` if there aren't enough billable-tasks , figure out something else to do . take on pro-bono-work ( at least you 'll ingratiate yourself with the partner who does pro-bono ) . '' another posting stated `` there is a tremendous-amount of pro-bono-work done at biglaw ( large-law-firms ) in civil-rights-matters . often just a few associates and partners shoulder the bulk of pro-bono-work at biglaw , therefore they like to see people who want to do lots of pro-bono . some firms even give billable-credit for pro-bono-work ( yeehaaa ) . '' an associate-speaking to transactional-lawyers advised them that '' there is an infinite-amount of pro-bono-work out there ( transactional-stuff for not for profits , etc . ) that can keep people busy with the remaining-hours in their day . '' a litigation associate suggested to others that `` one thing i have seen regarding experience is that the younger associates who are motivated to do pro-bono-work , and actually get trial/court experience that way , do get rewarded with more significant-work-assignments for their efforts earlier in their careers . at least that is true in the big nyc firm where i practice . '' lack of support however , there were an equal-number of messages expressing concern over the lack of support for pro-bono , especially during a slow-economy . as vice-president dick cheney would say , this is '' unvarnished '' information so it 's not always pretty . one associate 's message read , `` keeping-associates around for a few slow months does not mean that they will necessarily be twiddling their thumbs . a smart-firm will have these people working on pro-bono matters , writing-articles ... `` this person went on to ask , `` has anyone seen the amlaw 200 pro-bono ranking recently ? many of these same firms that are talking about firing-people are pretty much the same firms with pathetic pro-bono programs . if they are so slow right now , that 's pretty-sad that they 'd rather have people doing little or nothing than working on a pro-bono matter . '' another associate concurred , stating , `` rather than using this excess-capacity as an opportunity to rev up their pathetic pro-bono programs and give something back to the community for a few months , they fire people and protect the bottom line . '' on a site dedicated to `` greedy '' associates , it is heartening to see so much-discussion about some very non-greedy-subjects such as pro-bono . not even law-schools are spared from criticism , as one prospective-law-student is advised that `` law-schools , the aba and other groups scream that it seems that young-lawyers only care about money . it seems that young-lawyers only want to work for firms that pay top-dollar . it seems that pro-bono , government-work , and community-service is going out the window . but guess what ? rack up a $ 100k in student-loans that require about $ 1000 a month or more payments and you too will care about money . '' common-perception despite a common-perception that would place most lawyers in the greedyassociates-category , the legal-profession is probably more generous than just about any other profession . a report commissioned some years ago showed that lawyers in new york state donated over two million hours of pro-bono-service per year . this was supplemented by millions of dollars in donations to legal-aid and pro-bono programs . although 2002 was a difficult-year for lawyers , the more than 1600 associates who donated to generousassociates are another testament to the profession's generosity . all of these numbers prove that being `` greedy '' does not preclude being `` generous .
