the star-ledger newark survey : legal-system fails poor - most do n't know how to find a lawyer , or think they ca n't afford one kate coscarelli sunday , october 27 , 2002 each year , more than one-third of new jersey 's poor-adults - more than 400,000 people - have at least one civil legal-problem such as a dispute with a landlord , a divorce or bankruptcy . but fewer than one in six get help from a lawyer , according to a survey . many of these people do n't seek a lawyer 's help because they think they can not afford it , think the problem is not important enough or think nothing can be done about the problem . complicating the situation is that many of these people don't know where to find a lawyer . these findings are part of a survey , the first of its kind in almost 20 years to examine the experiences of the poor in the legal-system , released today by the nonprofit legal-services of new jersey , an edison corporation that coordinates the state 's system of legal-aid-organizations . the agency has a $ 38.5 million annual-budget that comes mainly from state-appropriations and the interest from the trust-accounts lawyers maintain for their clients ' funds . the findings should put the legal-community on notice that more needs to be done because the problem is only going to get worse , said melville miller , president of legal-services . `` the enormous legal-assistance-gap can not be tolerated by a just society , by a society that asks people to be governed by the rule of law , '' said miller . `` a key part of that is the notion of equal-justice and equal-access to the court-system . if , in fact , you do n't have equal-access then we do n't have equal-justice . '' among the other survey-findings : ugh few of those surveyed were able to get legal-help , about 71 percent believe the court-system is a fair-place to resolve disputes , and roughly 61 percent believe the courts and legal-system help make society safe . the most common-type of legal-problem had to do with housing . about 20 percent of people had problems such as poorly maintained rental-property or disputes with a landlord or utility-company . about 18 percent had consumer-related issues . among the claims participants cited included being denied credit and problems regarding-taxes or bankruptcy . people who are younger , employed , responsible for children or living in rental-housing are more likely to experience at least one problem each year . the survey relied on telephone-interviews with 1,013 randomly selected english- and spanish- speaking-adults in all 21 counties between july and october of last year . each of the participants lived in new jersey for at least one year and earned an annual-income below 200 percent of the federal-poverty-level . for a family of four , the limit for legal-aide would be $ 36,200 . people of limited financial-means can find themselves in an unstable-situation when faced with legal-problems , said jon dubin , director of clinical-programs at rutgers university law-school in newark . `` it is a very precarious-existence if you are living on a low-income and you barely have enough for anything else except for food or clothing , and then all of a sudden there is an additional-demand on you based on some legal-matter - that throws everything off . now you are facing the prospects of homelessness , malnutrition and worse , '' said dubin . caroline grant , 74 , wanted to get a lawyer to fight the traffic ticket she was given for running a stop-sign after getting into an accident recently . but the ocean county resident - who has a bad-heart and supports her son and his kids on a $ 404 monthly social-security check - could n't afford one . `` they wanted a lot of money that i just did n't have . so , i went to court by myself and told them the truth , but it did n't do me any good . i still had to pay the ticket . . . i just figure if you are rich you can afford a lawyer , if you are poor you take what you get , '' said grant , a resident of the mayetta-section of stafford township . based on the current-resources , the gap is unlikely to be closed anytime soon , the study found . attorneys working for legal-services help about 50,000 people a year . and clinics at the state 's three law-schools and other nonprofit legal-organizations help 10,000 more people a year . there are no reliable-numbers to determine how many cases are handled by private-attorneys for free , but those contributions are minor . around the country , the picture is similarly-bleak , said william hornsby , staff-counsel in the american bar-association 's division for legal-services . the aba has conducted similar-studies that support the new jersey findings . the most recent aba survey was released in 1994 which found about 20 percent of the nation 's poor who need a lawyer 's help can find one . `` the challenge is for the individual with their own case to find the lawyer who is most appropriate , '' he said . `` the challenge for the community for lawyers to have outreach in ways that are effective and reach those clients . '' elsewhere , groups of lawyers have come up with innovative-ways to reach people in need of legal-help . in santa monica , calif. , local-attorneys opened a coffee-house called legal grind , where for about $ 20 a person can get a cup of coffee and a consultation with a lawyer . in the baltimore area , the university of maryland created the civil-justice network , a consortium of solo and small-law-firm lawyers who want to do public-interest-work . and in iowa , one firm , beckman & hirsch in burlington , offers an online-program that leads visitors through a series of questions to create a will . in new jersey , outreach-efforts are limited . the somerset county chapter of the american civil liberties union holds a free legal-clinic on the second thursday of every month . about 10 people attend the meetings in the atrium of the county 's administration-building . each person-talks over their problem with a lawyer , said alisa mariani , vice-chair of the chapter . organizers try to get the word out as best as they can but they realize the program does n't fill the void , she said . `` we make it clear that the lawyers can not take a case , they are just there to give them some initial-direction about whether they have a good-case , '' said mariani . court-officials include the phone-numbers of the local legal-services-office and county-lawyer referral-system on every summons . they also created a packet of information available for free to help people navigate the court-system without a lawyer . while court-officials are concerned about the findings , their assistance can only go so far , said winnie comfort , a spokeswoman for the administrative office of the courts . `` the court does what it can and it is important that the court remain a fair and neutral-ground , '' she said . leaders of the new jersey state-bar-association called the gap revealed by the survey `` overwhelming '' and said it provides hard facts the bar can examine to find more ways to help low-income-residents get attorneys . `` clearly , people do n't know how to reach lawyers . such services should be better publicized , they should be better promoted , '' said harold rubenstein , executive director of the bar-association . `` it's the beginning of looking to see how you meet those needs .
