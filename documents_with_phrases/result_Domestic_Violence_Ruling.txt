new york times january 8 , 2002 judge 's domestic-violence-ruling creates an outcry in kentucky by francis x. clines exington , ky. , jan. 4 - the violent-arena of domestic-abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here , now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them . `` you ca n't have it both ways , '' said judge megan lake thornton of fayette county district-court in recently fining two women $ 100 and $ 200 respectively for obtaining protective-orders forbidding their partners from contacting them , then relenting and contacting the men . ruling that the order was mutually-binding , judge thornton also cited the men for contempt . `` it drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want , '' said judge thornton , who is experienced in the state 's thick domestic-abuse-docket , which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective-orders a year . kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive-relationships in the state . judge thornton 's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered-women , who plan to appeal it . the advocates say the finding goes beyond existing-law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic-abuse-cases , which involve economic and family-dependency and other complications of daily-living . the state-office on domestic-violence has pointedly agreed , warning that the ruling could cause abused-women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble . `` the reality is it 's easy to say they should never have contact , '' said sherry currens , executive director of the kentucky domestic-violence association , an advocacy and legal-protection group . `` but we 're talking about people in long-term-relationships . they may have children in common . it 's pretty-hard to say , `never speak again . ' people have financial-difficulties . they may love the partner . it 's not an easy-thing . '' but judge thornton declared in court , `` when these orders are entered , you do n't just do whatever you damn well please and ignore them . '' the ruling stunned cindra walker , the lawyer for the two women , who is with central kentucky legal-services , which represents many of the thousands of indigent-women caught in abusive-relationships . `` for over five years , i 've been in court practically every day on these abuse-cases , '' ms. walker said , `` and i 've never before had a victim threatened with contempt . '' `` the domestic-violence-law is a tool for victims to use to be safe , '' not a device to punish them , she said . one of the women in the ruling said she eventually moved back with her partner while the other had occasional-contacts , ms. walker said . judge thornton 's office said judicial-rules barred her from commenting on the cases . but her two rulings made clear that she expected the original-orders against all contact to apply equally to the person suspected of abuse and the abused . `` they are orders of the court , '' the judge declared , according to court-transcripts obtained by the lexington herald-leader . `` people are ordered to follow them , and i do n't care which side you're on . '' carol jordan , the director of the governor 's office of child-abuse and domestic-violence , said she disagreed with judge thornton 's ruling even as she sympathized with the professionals who must try to oversee violent domestic-situations . `` these are tough-cases for judges , '' ms. jordan said . `` they are dealing with complex human-emotions . they are dealing with danger . '' but if the ruling stands , ms. jordan warned , some abused-women will conclude that they will not be treated fairly if they seek refuge in the courts . this sort of ruling `` absolutely-increases abused-women 's level of risk '' by seemingly encouraging their abusers , ms. jordan said . in kentucky , as in much of the rest of the nation , abuse-victims have increasingly turned to the courts as protective-orders have become more accepted , said billie lee dunford- jackson , assistant director of family-violence-law and policy for the national council of juvenile and family-court judges . most judges `` have been making clear to the batterers that the issue is between the state-courts and them , '' ms. dunford- jackson said , rather than a domestic-issue between two parties . a `` sizable-minority '' of judges may still regard the conflicting parties equally in their rulings , she said , but newer state-laws have increasingly put the focus on violent-abuse as the main-problem requiring-state-intervention . ms. walker 's two clients , jamie harrison and robin hull , declined to be interviewed . ms. walker , one of two legal-service lawyers handling-hundreds of abuse-cases in 17 counties , said , `` our big-concern now is the chilling-effect this will have . '' two years ago , the kentucky legislature considered a proposal to apply the protective-orders equally to the accused and the victim , ms. jordan said , but the notion of mutual-protection , equating the two parties , is not part of state-law . judge thornton 's ruling , she contended , will `` establish a barrier that stops abused-women from seeking-protection of the courts .
