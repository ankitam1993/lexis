unlikely-union puts man on national-team by maribel-villalva sunday , feb. 9 , 2003 florentino `` lico '' subia 's entire-life-history is inside his chihuahuita-home in south el paso . he sits in his kitchen and points to the adjacent-room where he was born . he goes to another room and pulls out a handful of legal-size-envelopes with dozens of black-and-white-photographs that document his days as a boxer , a korean war veteran , a motorcyclist and a father . but the envelope that continues to grow each year is the one with pictures of him with president bush and first lady laura bush , along with christmas cards he 's received from the couple over the years . it 's a friendship that began spontaneously about five years ago and changed subia 's life . `` people look at me and wonder why i 'm friends with him , '' subia said . `` but he took a liking to me . '' subia was nominated by president bush to the board of directors of the legal-services corp. -- a nonprofit-organization dedicated to providing legal-services to low-income-people . last weekend , subia traveled to washington , d.c. , along with five other nominees , to meet with the board of directors . his name has been submitted to the senate for confirmation , and organization-officials expect subia to be approved in the next few months . mauricio-vivero , a spokesman for the organization , said subia made a great-impression on everyone at the meetings . `` he provided some valuable-insight to us because he comes here as a representative of the people who are eligible for our services , '' vivero said . `` if approved , he 's going to be a fresh voice and a great-contributor to this board . '' subia , who quit high school at age 14 to help his family and who has never earned more than minimum-wage in his life , never imagined he could one day serve on a committee at the request of the president . and while he 's nervous about his new duties , it 's the words-then-gov . bush told him that give him the confidence he needs . `` he told me , 'you just keep on being lico . you 've got common sense , and those are the kind of people i like , ' `` subia said . subia and his wife of 28 years , mickie subia , traveled to washington , d.c . while subia 's trip was paid for by the organization , mickie 's was not . friends and family pulled enough-money together to send mickie on the trip . subia said he wanted to share the experience with his wife , and mickie was more than happy to go . `` it felt really-nice that everybody got together to do something for us , '' mickie said . cesar viramontes , owner of international garment-processors in el paso , was one of the friends who pitched in for the trip . `` lico likes to be recognized as a biker , but i 'm sure he 's very happy and proud to be assigned to anything by the president , '' viramontes said . `` lico can offer a lot of input from the perspective of a barrio-person , and he 's also someone who is always helping other people . '' subia never hides his identity . he bought a suit for the first meeting with the other board of directors , but by the second meeting , he wore the clothes all el pasoans recognize him in : his jeans , leather-jacket and bandanna . `` they got to see who i really am , '' he said . a strange-twist of fate subia 's friendship with the bushes began through a tragic-event in his life -- the death of his 21-year-old son , florentino `` nunie '' subia jr . it was father 's day , 1980 , and subia got the call all parents dread . nunie was killed instantly in a motorcycle-car-accident in the lower valley . `` that was the hardest day of my life . i think i got all my gray hair in the two weeks after that , '' he said . to memorialize his son , subia asked his artist-friend felipe adame to paint a mural at his home . the mural depicts two motorcycles in the back of a pickup , which is headed toward the beach . at about the same time , el paso gallery-owner adair margo was involved in a junior league of el paso project that was documenting murals in the city , which is how she came across lico subia 's home . then , when margo was giving a tour of the city 's murals to then-texas first lady laura bush , they stopped at the home and bush met subia 's wife , mickie . she returned to the home on a later-visit and the first lady even tried on his leather-jacket and posed for a picture on subia 's motorcycle . when subia finally met the governor a few days later at the chamizal national memorial , subia needed no introduction . `` he told me , 'you do n't have to tell me who you are . my wife told me all about you , ' `` he said . margo said both lico and mickie have an unforgettable-quality about them , which is why the bushes have always wanted to see them on their trips to el paso . `` they are just who they are , '' margo said . `` that 's why i love when things ( like the nomination ) happen to people who are not clamoring for it . lico was never seeking this , but the president recognized a quality in him . '' subia acknowledges that none of this would have happened if it were n't for the mural outside his home . he said his son is looking out for him from beyond the grave . `` i would prefer to have my son alive and to be with him , but he did help open a lot of doors for me . '' subia 's new role in the legal-services corp. will require him to work on behalf of poor-citizens who are requesting legal-assistance . but subia is no stranger to helping-people . even though he and his wife are low-income , subia has never shied away from raising-money for people less fortunate than himself . subia is president of a motorcycle-club , the iron horses , which raises money-year-round for a variety of causes , but mostly to help children . `` the way i see it , i got it made in the shade , '' he said . `` there are some really needy-people out there .
