major-changes hit city legal-services restructuring plan prompts lawsuit in bronx by daniel wise the new york city legal-services-program is undergoing a radical restructuring at the prompting of the federal legal-services corporation . the transformation will leave the program , which was formed in 1967 along the model of decentralized-school-boards under local community-control , with a far more centralized-structure . for the last 35 years , the program has had a two-tiered structure , in which a citywide-agency , now called legal-services for new york city ( lsny ) , has received federal-funds that in turn have been distributed to seven different local-corporations , which provided the bulk of services in civil legal-matters to indigent new yorkers . lsny 's role has been generally-limited to certain administrative-functions , though over the years it has come to run two programs of its own . under the revised structure , which is expected to be put in place in the early-part of next year , lsny will have a controlling voice in the selection of the boards for the local-corporations . in addition , the local-corporations are being asked to adopt new certificates of incorporation and bylaws , which some of the groups contend vastly expand lsny 's powers . one program , bronx legal-services , was so distressed by the changes that it filed a lawsuit in the southern district of new york , seeking to block its restructuring . approximately 140 of the 160 lawyers working in the program are employed by the seven local-corporations . the remaining 20 lawyers work either in the lsny central-office or in the two programs it directly runs : one for the elderly and the other for the poor in the williamsburg and brighton-beach-sections of brooklyn . lsny disperses approximately $ 33 million a year , of which $ 12 million comes from the federal legal-services corporation . of the $ 12 million , 22 percent is earmarked for the lsny budget and 78 percent is allocated among the seven local-corporations , according to lsny spokeswoman , edwina martin . the legal-services corporation insisted upon the changes , according to its spokesman eric kleiman because the new york program 's structure is `` completely-anomalous '' in that there are '' two degrees of separation '' between the federal-corporation and the programs actually delivering civil legal-services . the change is necessary , he added , to assure `` a true-oversight mechanism '' for the new york city program . as the funding-agency , lsny subcontracted with the local-boards to provide legal-services , and was left with only the `` drastic-remedy '' of defunding a local-program if problems in management or delivery of services were uncovered , he said . defunding was not a viable-remedy , mr. kleiman added , because `` the only people hurt are those who benefit from the services . '' the new york law journal ( ny ) - thursday , august 15 , 2002 bronx program 's lawsuit however , walker thompson , the head of bronx legal-services , which filed a lawsuit on aug. 5 seeking to block the changes , said the restructuring `` threatens our ability to be a good legal-services-program . '' the change in corporate-structure , he explained , `` eviscerates local-control by placing-power in a distant-entity - lsny - with little need to be accountable to the bronx community . '' also , he charged that bylaw-changes , which lsny is forcing through its exercise of its power over his program 's purse , '' expands enormously lsny 's legislative-power to tell local-programs what they can and can not do . '' the changes , he added , further empower lsny to get involved in the minutiae of running local-programs by , for instance , requiring lsny to approve the expenditure of very small-sums of money . michael w. martin , a fordham university school of law-professor who sits on the lsny board , however , countered that the changes were narrowly tailored to ensure effective-monitoring by lsny , while still preserving the power of local-boards to run their programs . he explained , for instance , that provisions were being written into the new bylaws that would prohibit lsny from forcing any bylaw-changes for two years . these provisions , he said , would preserve forever the rights of local-programs to `` disassociate '' with lsny . the core-change in corporate-structure under the reorganization recasts all seven of the local-corporations as membership organizations with lsny as the sole-member . under new york's not-for-profit-corporation-law , a non-profit can be structured along the lines of a business-corporation by creating a class of members , analogous to a business ' shareholders , who run the corporation through their power to select the corporation 's board of directors , explained sean delaney , one of the lawyers who worked on the restructuring for lsny . businesses use the device to create a wholly owned subsidiary , said mr. delaney , executive director of lawyers ' alliance of new york . similarly , he said , lsny will exercise control over the local-corporations by being designated as the sole-member in each corporation , empowered to choose or discharge-board-members . professor martin asserted that lsny `` has no plans '' under consideration to exercise its powers as the sole corporate-member to force any changes on the boards of the local-corporations . he also pointed out that lsny has agreed to bylaw-changes that circumscribe its otherwise unlimited-powers over the selection and replacement of local-board-members . for instance , he said , lsny had agreed to select new members from a slate put together by a local corporation . but bronx legal-services ' mr. thompson took little-comfort from those concessions . the new york law journal ( ny ) - thursday , august 15 , 2002 even without the corporate-changes , he noted , lsny has asserted the right to withhold from the local-corporations-money that it gets on their behalf from the legal-services corporation and any other source . for his group , that would mean lsny can withhold more than 80 percent of its $ 4.5 million annual-budget if its lawsuit fails . bronx legal-services raises about $ 450,000 a year through its own fund-raising-initiatives , he explained . martin needleman , the executive director of brooklyn legal-services corp. a , said there is wide-backing from the other programs for the lawsuit , bronx legal-services v. legal-services for new york city , 02-6199 . but he added that many other groups '' had gone along [ with the reorganization ] reluctantly '' when faced with the possible-loss of most of their budgets . the five local-programs in addition to bronx legal-services and brooklyn legal-services corp. a are bedford stuyvesant legal-services , harlem legal-services , south brooklyn legal-services corp. b , mfy legal-services and queens legal-services .
