legal-hotline for seniors loses grant , wo n't expand by nancy weaver teichert saturday , january 25 , 2003 the loss of a federal-grant has stymied plans for the senior legal-hotline to expand its free legal-services statewide . the hotline lost out on a grant from the federal administration on aging , which would have provided $ 175,000 a year for the next three years . david mandel , supervising-attorney , protested to federal-officials about the way the hotline 's grant-application had been evaluated . he said a package of 20 letters of support failed to reach some of the judges . the hotline , which is part of legal-services of northern california , was the only california application from 24 submitted nationwide for $ 1.5 million in grants . `` it was because of a screw-up in washington that california is losing having a program like this , '' said mandel . `` other states got it instead . '' kay loughrey , a program-information-specialist with the aging administration , said grant-applications were ranked a second time after the judges got a chance to review the letters . `` they went above and beyond what would be customarily done , '' she said . `` they still did not rank high enough to be selected . '' mandel said the loss means the hotline wo n't continue with plans to expand statewide and wo n't be able to serve as many people in northern california . about two full-time-staff-positions will be lost along with other cuts in staff-hours . last year , about 7,200 people were given quick legal-advice over the telephone and by email , but that number may drop by 1,000 to 2,000 with the staff-cuts this year , mandel said . chisorom-okwuosa , legal-services-developer for the california department of aging , said state officials supported the hotline's grant-application . the service is needed but the state 's budget-crisis means it is not in a position to step in and help . `` there is a need to expand legal-services as a whole , '' she said . the hotline will emphasize help to sacramento county seniors with funds provided by the area 4 agency on aging . it offers legal-advice on landlord and tenant-disputes , foreclosures , consumer disputes and planning for long-term-care , including social-security issues . the hotline also has special-funds to help grandparents who are caring for their grandchildren in sacramento , placer , yuba , sutter , yolo , nevada and sierra counties . many grandparents need help on custody-issues . earlier this year , the senior legal-services task-force submitted a report to the state-legislature that supported a statewide-senior legal-hotline . mandel said the hotline is searching for private-foundation funds to finance its expansion and may increase its efficiency with a new telephone-system . the senior legal-hotline can be reached at ( 916 ) 551-2140 or ( 800 ) 222-1753
