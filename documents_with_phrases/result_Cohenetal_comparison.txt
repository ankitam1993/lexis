a comparison of the burden of universal-service in italy * and the united states robert cohen rossana scocchera postal-rate commission poste italiane carla pace vincenzo visco comandini poste italiane poste italiane matthew robinson john waller postal-rate commission postal-rate commission gennaro-scarfiglieri spyros xenakis poste italiane postal-rate commission 1 . introduction samuel johnson said patriotism is the last-refuge of a scoundrel and many postal-observers believe that the universal-service-obligation ( uso ) is the last-refuge of a postal-service wishing to protect inefficiency , monopoly-profits , or economic-rents . despite inefficient-service , opaque-accounts , and large-rents , many postal-officials maintain that the monopoly , whatever its faults , is the only means of ensuring universal , affordable postal-service for citizens throughout the nation . without the monopoly , they argue , the post-office would be crushed by the cost of the uso . this paper examines when this argument might be valid . all posts probably have some cost associated with the uso , but it has been difficult to quantify . we agree with john panzar ( 2001 ) that the cost of the uso is the cost of the services that would not be provided in a competitive-market . under this definition , in practice , there has been no discernable uso cost . competition exists in both sweden and new zealand and the incumbent-posts have continued to provide universal-service with no subsidy . the uso as defined by the proponents of the monopoly goes well beyond ubiquitous-service . it also includes a uniform-price with respect to location of the recipient1 and a uniform-frequency of delivery . these conditions might have been appropriate a century ago when the post was the primary-means of communication . today however , this definition seems unduly-restrictive . it is incumbent on defenders of the restrictive-definition of uso to explain why postal-service should be treated * the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of poste italiane or the postal-rate commission . in other words a firm can not charge more for delivering similar items to addresses in one section of the country than another . under this definition united parcel-service ( ups ) is not a true universal-service-provider because it imposes a surcharge for residential-delivery . this is ironic because ups delivers to every address in the continental u.s. and delivers right to the door . the postal-service which is a universal-service-provider under the definition used here , delivers to mail-boxes that are , in many cases , remote from the actual-address . differently from other important-products such as groceries , bank-accounts and internet service.2 notwithstanding , we use this restrictive-definition of universal-service for this paper . the obligation to provide ubiquitous-service is not in itself onerous . it has been pointed out by the american-co-authors of this paper that a post could rationalize its delivery-costs by reducing the frequency of service on unprofitable-routes to the point where they become profitable ( cohen et al . 2000 ) . a post could also rationalize its prices by reflecting the cost of service to different-areas . the restrictive-definition of the uso does not allow a post to rationalize either its cost or pricing structure,3 thus , creating cream-skimming-opportunities under liberalization . the burden that the restrictive uso imposes on a post is the increase in its unit-costs resulting from cream-skimming under liberalization caused by the requirements of uniform-pricing and levels of service . we use the term `` burden of the uso '' to distinguish our concept from other papers that use the term `` cost of the uso . '' we believe that insights into the burden of the uso can be gained by comparing postal-systems . assuming that the keenest insights can be gained by comparing-systems with large-differences , the italian and united states systems are good-candidates . the u.s. has the highest volume per capita in the industrial-world ( 739 pieces in 1999 ) , while italy has one of the lowest ( 115 pieces in 1999 ) .4 previous-work by cohen et al . shows that the u.s . postal-service ( usps ) is not likely to require the monopoly to continue to satisfy the uso . ( cohen 1999 , 2000 ) however , this result may not apply to all posts and it is important to distinguish magnitudes of burden for different-posts . to this end , we develop a model to determine the uso burden for posts with different per capita-volumes . in particular , applying the model demonstrates that the burden of uso is very great for poste italiane and other posts with small per capita-volumes . on the other hand , for the u.s. and other posts with large and medium per capita-volumes the burden is small . we first compare some statistics for italy and the u.s. we then examine the consequences of volume-loss on postal-systems in order to provide a measure of burden in terms of increases in average-unit-costs as volume is lost to competitors , or 2 many postal-services are increasingly becoming primarily carriers of advertising . u.s. households receive far more advertising than letters , bills or other similar-matter . according to the household diary study ( united states postal-service 2000 ) , in 1999 , 56 percent of the pieces received by u.s. households were advertising-mail . 3 an apparent-exception is consignia . it rationalizes its delivery-cost by delivering twice a day in most urban-areas and once a day in rural areas . 4 italy has a very undeveloped direct-mail-market and the italian monopoly does not include direct-mail . the u.s. monopoly includes all addressed direct-mail consisting of fewer than 24 pages . the u.s . postal-service handled 314 pieces per capita of direct-mail in 1999. equivalently , the increase in average-rates for the volume remaining.5 next we introduce the concept of delivery-route-profit and quantify the relative-profits from delivered mail and mail not requiring-delivery in both italy and the u.s. we then compare the distribution of profit margins for routes in italy and the u.s. and the effect this has on vulnerability to cream-skimming . finally , we discuss two measures of the cost of universal-service , the entry-pricing-measure and the net avoided-cost-measure in the context of delivery-profits . we compare them with our burden-measure for the poste italiane and the u.s . postal-service . our principal-findings are : the burden of the uso is much greater for small per capita-volume-posts than it is for large and medium per capita-volume-posts . the likelihood of a graveyard-spiral resulting from volume-loss to cream-skimmers is remote for medium to large-volume per capita-posts ; whereas it is a real-threat to small-volume per capita-posts . the measure of burden presented here combined with the distribution of route-profit-margins for poste italiane and the u.s . postal-service yields results contrary to the entry-price and net avoided-cost-measures for the cost of the uso . the portion of mail not requiring-delivery is a very important contributor to the finances of a post . 2 . comparative-statistics table 1 contains some statistics for italy and the u.s. and for their postal administrations.6 italy has 21 percent of the u.s. population and 16 percent ( approximately one seventh ) of the u.s. per capita-volume . most of the delivery-statistics in the table's second section are reasonably-close to this 16-percent-figure . the number of delivery-points in italy , as a percentage of those in the u.s. , is a 5 to provide a basis for comparing poste italiane and the u.s . postal-service , we use a model of postal-operations that follows the structure of fy 1999 costs in the u.s . postal-service . parametric-analyses are conducted by varying-volume under different-assumptions about the extent that institutional-cost varies over the long run . the model is validated for poste italiane by making-adjustments for major-differences in the two posts , such as the extent of worksharing . 6 prices of goods and services vary between italy and the united states , and the prevailing market exchange rate does not necessarily account for the relative-differences in prices . we have used the purchasing power parity ( ppp ) of 1,677 liras per u.s. dollar to convert the 1999 italian-statistics reported in italian liras . the ppp has been produced by the organization of economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) and shows the number of italian liras required in 1999 to buy goods and services-equivalent to what can be purchased with one u.s. dollar . in 1999 , the average-market exchange rate , reported by the international monetary fund ( imf ) , was 1,817 liras per u.s. dollar . disproportionately high 25 percent . the disproportionate-number of small-business-addresses in italy ( scarfiglieri and visco comandini 2001 ) may help explain this . poste italiane also has disproportionately more delivery-points per route . this results from a much lower coverage ( percent of addresses receiving-mail on a given day ) , a higher population-density and other unexplored-route and topographical considerations.7 we see in the fourth-section that the u.s . postal-service cost per piece is much lower than poste-italiane-cost per piece despite having a much higher labor-cost per employee . this is primarily a result of economies of scale , worksharing and the extensive-use of automation.8 table 1 . selected national and postal statistics for fy 1999a italy as italy u.s . percent of u.s .

that 7 uso 206 this the the has in it also illustrates that the concept of the uso has many more dimensions than ubiquitous-delivery . however , the cross-subsidy that results from ubiquitous-delivery and uniform-prices and frequency of delivery is widely regarded as the most important-aspect of the uso mitigating against liberalization . this paper will be restricted to dealing with this aspect . 7 motorcycles are the primary-means of carrier-transport in italy and automobiles are the primary-means in the u.s. 8 it is also the result of the quantity of non-delivered-mail ( see section 4 ) . 3 . relative impact of volume-loss on postal-systems the burden of the uso on a postal-system lies within its fixed-costs . ceteris-paribus , unit ( per piece ) fixed-costs are higher in a low-volume per capita-system than in a high volume per capita-system . we examine the effect of volume on unit-total-costs . the sensitivity of cost to volume for a postal-system can be investigated directly provided the ratio of fixed to variable-costs is known by function . some postal-administrations do not have this information and some choose not to make it available to regulators or the public . consequently , we have built a model to estimate the relationship between unit-average-costs and per capita-volume . 9 the model is described in the appendix and includes parameters for the portion of variable-costs by major postal-functions . when the average-unit-cost is graphed as a function of volume per capita one obtains a curve with a parabolic-shape . the exact-shape of the curve depends on the specific-set of parameters used to benchmark the model , such as the proportion of fixed-costs at a specific per capita-volume . because the cost-behavior of the u.s . postal-service has been studied extensively and because u.s. postal-costs are the most transparent in the industrialized-world , we use u.s data from 1999 as provided in the most recent omnibus-rate-proceeding , docket no . r2000-1 to benchmark the model10-table 2 shows the u.s. institutional/variable percentages for the major postal-functions . table 2 : u.s. fixed/variable cost by major function a ( fy 1999 ) a source : postal-rate commission docket no . r2000-1 b delivery includes in-office and out-of-office-costs . because the u.s . postal-service may differ greatly from other postal-systems in labor-cost , automation , route-topography , worksharing , mix of mail by shape , and the percentage of non-delivered-mail , etc. , we can not expect the cost-estimates furnished by the model to be extremely accurate-estimates of particular non-u.s. systems . for our 9 we use pieces per capita rather than total-volume to normalize the volume . 10 this model has been developed on the assumption that the cost-behavior of postal-administrations is essentially-similar . the functions of collection , delivery , transportation , processing and window-services are common to the postal-administrations of all industrialized-countries . purposes we do not need great-accuracy , we only need reasonable-estimates in order to examine the sensitivity of total-unit-cost to volume per capita . the fixed-portion of non-delivery-costs would be expected to change as we move from higher volume-administrations to lower volume-ones . it would be expected that lower volume postal-administrations would try to keep them small to reduce the burden on rate-payers . since these costs are variable in the long run and we do not know how other postal-administrations deal with them , we parameterize them for purposes of modeling . as a preliminary-matter , using the fixed/variable ratios for u.s . postal-service costs from table 2 , figure 1 shows that as per capita-volume-increases , the mail-processing-proportion of total-cost will increase and the delivery-proportion will decrease . this is because mail-processing-costs are almost all variable while delivery-costs have a very large fixed-component . since the u.s. volume per capita is the highest in the world , the u.s . postal-service delivery-costs-proportion should be the smallest of any postal-service . on the other hand , poste italiane per capita-volume is among the lowest in the industrialized-world , and so its delivery-costs-proportion should be among the highest . figure 1 : functional-percentage of total-costs benchmarked by u.s. costs and volumes with 25 % of non-delivery institutional-costs long-run variable percentage of total-costs 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 pieces per capita again using the ratios for u.s . postal-service costs in table 2 , figure 2 shows the variability of the major-functions as per capita-volume changes . it can be seen that at low-volumes , mail-processing and transportation-costs have a high degree of fixity while at high volumes they are almost all variable . figure 2 : m odeled-variabilities by function b enchm arked by u .s . c o sts and v o lu m es w-ith 25 % of n on-d

represent different-variabilities of non-delivery fixed-costs as shown in the legend . it appears that unit-costs are not very sensitive to changes in per capita-volume at the high end but are quite-sensitive at the low-end . for example , a ten-percent-reduction in pieces per capita for the u.s . postal-service would result in costs increasing about one cent . a ten-percent-reduction for a post at 100 pieces per capita would increase-unit-costs by nine cents . the increase in unit-cost resulting from a ten-percent-decrease in per capita-volume for a range of volumes is shown in table 3 . figure 3 : model estimates of unit cos benchmarked by u.s. costs and volumes pieces per capita long-run-variability of non-delivery institutional-costs in the per capita-volume-range of most northern european countries , canada , new zealand and australia , the effect on unit-cost from a ten-percent-reduction in per capita-volume is not great . at about 200 pieces per capita the effect of volume-loss on unit-cost becomes much more pronounced.11 table 3 : unit-cost with 10 % decrease in volume assuming 25 % of non-delivery institutional-costs are long-run variable ( 1999 u.s . dollars ) pieces per capita 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 base unit-cost 0.32 0.33 0.36 0.40 0.46 0.59 0.97 unit-cost with 10 % volume-loss 0.33 0.35 0.38 0.42 0.49 0.63 1.06 when volume is lost to cream-skimmers because of the uso , net-revenue losses ( revenue minus cost ) must be made up from the remaining-volume to maintain breakeven-status . the burden-measure quantifies the resulting-increase in unit-cost and revenue that must be made up from each piece of mail that remains in the system . an important-question is whether the rate-increases would lead to a graveyard-spiral . we think the burden-measure provides an answer to this question . insofar as the burden of the uso might introduce a death-spiral ( crew and kleindorfer 2000 ) owing to the loss of volume because of liberalization , the probability seems slight until per capita-volumes are in the 100 to 150-piece range . below that point the possibility of a death-spiral-increases rapidly . thus , we conclude that the burden of the uso is much greater for low per capita-volume-posts than for medium to high volume-ones . in order to make the model more useful for comparing poste italiane and the u.s . postal-service we adjust model-costs to account for important known-differences . since worksharing activities reduce united states costs by about 25 percent ( cohen et al . 2001 ) , we increase model-costs to account for the lack of worksharing in italy . the portion of the model-costs that are labor costs is adjusted downwards to reflect hourly-labor-cost differences between poste italiane and the u.s . postal-service . in addition , model-costs are adjusted to reflect the poste italiane proportion of low-cost-letters ( and cards ) , medium-cost-flats , and high-cost-parcels . the appendix describes the adjustment-factors . table 4-shows-estimates of poste italiane-unit-costs derived using the model . it can be seen that the model comes fairly-close to poste italiane-unit-costs . of course the model could be further refined to account for many more specific-differences . we leave that project for another day . nonetheless , we think the model is sufficiently-accurate to allow us to draw a major-conclusion : the burden of universal-service is highly-dependent on volume per capita , so policies suitable for liberalizing-medium and large per capita-volume-posts are likely not suitable for small per capita-volume-posts . greece , italy , portugal , and spain have per capita-volumes below 200 . table 4 : model estimates of poste italiane-unit-costs based on u.s. costs and variabilities

define the concept of route-profit ( and loss ) . we define the profitability of a delivery-route as the revenue generated by the mail delivered on the route minus the attributable upstream-costs of the mail delivered and the total-cost of the route ( cohen et al . 1999 ) . some mail handled by a postal-service does not require delivery ; recipients pick up mail from post-office-boxes and large-volume-recipients pick up mail in bulk from designated counters.12 non-delivered-mail can also be considered to have delivery-profits in the same manner as delivered mail.13 a postal-service has variable and fixed upstream-costs as well as variable and fixed-delivery-costs . in a breakeven postal-service total-delivery-profits from all routes plus profits from non-delivered-mail must equal fixed upstream costs.14 put another way , fixed upstream-costs minus profits from non-delivered-mail must equal delivery-profits . in order to compare profits from delivered and non-delivered-mail in italy and the u.s. we increase poste italiane revenue by 24 percent so that it equals cost and is thus at breakeven.15 table 5 shows that non-delivered-mail-accounts for a very disproportionate-share of delivery-profits in both posts ( and presumably in all posts ) . the most obvious-reason for this is that non-delivered-mail-incurs no carrier-delivery-cost . in addition , although many delivery-routes are highly-profitable , losses from unprofitable-routes reduce the net-delivery-profit from delivered mail . 12 in the united states , this is frequently called `` firm-holdout '' mail . 13 revenue minus attributable upstream-costs that includes the small amount of costs for non-carrier box or counter delivery activities associated with non-delivered-mail . 14 an analogous-identity holds for a post at any given profit ( loss ) . 15 data in this paper are from 1999 . in that year , the u.s . postal-service had profits of $ 400 million and total revenue of $ 62.8 billion . table 5 : distribution of volume and profits between delivered and non-delivered-mail ( percent ) italy u.s. volume profits volume profits delivered 8658 79 33 non-delivered 1442 21 67 because total-delivery-profits from delivered and non-delivered-mail must equal fixed upstream-costs , non-delivered-mail plays an important role in reducing the revenue needs of a breakeven-post . ceteris-paribus , the higher the proportion of non-delivered-mail , the lower the rates that a breakeven-post must charge . thus , the higher the proportion of non-delivered-mail , the less opportunity there is for a cream-skimmer to undercut the incumbent.16,17 moreover highly-profitable non-delivered-mail is much less vulnerable to diversion.18 5 . distribution of route-profit-margins and vulnerability to cream-skimming volumes , revenues and route-profits differ widely on routes in both italy and the u.s . the uniform-pricing-constraint of the uso creates cream-skimming possibilities because an entrant can target only highly-profitable routes and charge a price below the uniform-price . consequently , it is not cross-subsidy per se that allows cream-skimming . all routes could be above incremental-cost and the problem would still exist . cream-skimming stems from the uniform-pricing and service-constraints given that routes have disparate profits , and not necessarily from the need to cross-subsidize routes . 16 we would expect that the usps 's percentage of non-delivered-mail to be among the highest of industrialized-country-posts because the u.s. payment-system involves a large-fraction of financial-transactions paid by check and mailed to large-volume-recipients . this mail is generally picked up by them ( or their agents ) at a post-office ( i.e. , it is non-delivered-mail ) . 17 in a small per capita-volume-post , the fixed-cost of delivery represents a larger share of total-cost than in a large per capita-volume-post . ceteris-paribus , per piece-profit from non-delivered-mail is greater in a small per capita-volume-post than in a large one . 18 many of the 18 million boxholders in the united states do not want mail delivered to their premises . we can not quantify the number , but presumably , this is an important-reason why mail-recipients rent a post-office-box . these box-holders would not be good-candidates for cream-skimmers . fifty-six-percent of non-delivered-mail is single-piece . it is not likely that cream-skimmers would be able to successfully put a collection-system in place to capture much of this mail . of the 44 percent of non-delivered-mail that remains , 36 percent is first class , much of which is time sensitive . according to most models of cream-skimming , delivery-frequency would be reduced . time sensitive first class would be less likely to make use of a service with less frequent-delivery . finally , non-single-piece-mail addressed to box-holders is being transported and delivered over large-areas of the nation . a delivery-cream-skimmer would have to have a national presence to compete for this mail . this means much of the mail could not be handled by local-niche-players or even regional-cream skimmers . the more revenue that leaves the system because of cream-skimming , the more rates must be increased on the remaining-mail to maintain a breakeven-status . consequently , the greater the share of system-wide-revenue that is from high margin-routes , the greater impact that cream-skimming could have on a postal-administration . in order to compare the possible-effect of cream-skimming on the italian and u.s. postal-administrations , we have arrayed their routes by profit margin using fy 1999 data . again , we have adjusted the poste italiane revenue to breakeven in order to facilitate comparison . figure 4 displays the profit margin19 of routes arrayed by semi-deciles . the most profitable italian-semi-decile has a margin of just over 30 percent while the most profitable u.s. semi-decile has a margin of over 50 percent . however , a greater percentage of italian-routes are profitable than u.s. routes . we do not know the profit margin that would actually attract cream-skimmers . if it is 30 percent , then 10 percent of u.s. routes would be vulnerable and less than 7 percent of italian-routes would be vulnerable . virtually all profitable-routes in italy are urban . in the u.s. , only about half of the routes served by city-carriers are profitable while three quarters of the routes served by rural-carriers are profitable.20 it may well be that competition is much more likely to develop in urban-areas . if so , poste italiane would be at greater risk from cream-skimmers than the u.s . postal-service . 19 for purposes of this discussion , profit margin is defined as the ratio of delivery-profits to route-costs ( i.e . upstream-variable plus total-delivery-cost ) . 20 in the u.s. about one fifth of the routes served by rural-carriers are in high-density suburban-areas . 60 50 40 30 20 average-profit margin percentage 10 0 ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 30 ) ( 40 ) ( 50 ) ( 60 ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617181920 semi-decile ( routes by 5 % increments ) a revenue for poste italiane is increased by 24 % to create breakeven-conditions . the percent of total revenue by semi-decile is shown in table 6 . at every semidecile except the first , poste italiane receives a greater percentage of total revenue than the u.s . postal-service . this is due to the fact that a much larger percentage of u.s. revenue comes from undelivered-mail . the distribution of profitable-routes shown on figure 4 indicates that the u.s . postal-service 's revenue ( volume ) per route is much more skewed than poste italiane 's , as measured by the relative-size of the bars at the extremes . this would tend to make the u.s . postal-service more attractive to cream-skimmers than poste italiane ( at most profit-thresholds ) . this skewness-results from mail-volume being highly-correlated with income and u.s. income distribution being much more skewed than italian-income distribution . ( berthelemy and toledano 2000 ; kolin and smith 1999 ) in fact the u.s. has the most skewed-income-distribution of any industrialized-country as measured by the world bank 's gini index . the u.s. gini index is 40.8 while italy 's is 27.3.21 thus , italy should be fairly-typical of the distribution of route-profit-margins of industrial-countries and the u.s. should be an outlier . `` world development indicators 2001 , table 2.8 '' the world bank , washington , dc . the unweighted-average of gini indices for industrialized-countries is 30.6 . austria has the lowest index at 23.1 . table 6 : delivered mail revenue as percent of total revenue routes by semi-decile ( ranked by profit ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 cumulative-percent of total revenue u.s. italy 10 10 16 18 21 24 26 30 31 36 35 41 39 46 43 50 46 54 49 58 routes by semi-decile ( ranked by profit ) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 cumulative-percent of total revenue u.s. italy 53 62 56 66 59 69 61 72 64 74 66 77 69 79 71 81 72 83 73 84 because volume and revenue are highly-correlated , if volume is lost to cream-skimming , then revenue is also lost . figure 4 and table 6 can be used to estimate likely-profit and revenue-losses to cream-skimmers and figure 3 to estimate the cost-impact of volume-losses . depending on the threshold selected , the potential-impact on the respective-posts can be compared . we doubt that cream-skimmers could capture even a majority of the volume on any route-owing to the limited-amount of contestable volume in the u.s. and perhaps other countries.22 nevertheless , to the extent that volume would be lost to cream-skimmers , the impact on poste italiane would be greater than on the u.s . postal-service . as mentioned above , the italian-data have been adjusted for breakeven . had we not done this , very few italian-routes would be profitable . a postal-service that is below breakeven will be less attractive to cream-skimmers than otherwise . on the other hand , if a postal-service is above breakeven , its routes will be even more profitable and hence , more attractive to cream-skimmers . 6 . entry-pricing the entry-pricing-measure defines the cost of the uso as the sum of lost-profits from entry by a competitor . the form of entry that we consider is delivery-cream-skimming . if an entrant were more efficient than the incumbent , then the uso would not cause the lost profit . under the restrictive-definition of the uso , however , it is possible for the incumbent-post to be more efficient than the entrant and still lose profits because the incumbent must charge a uniform-price . the entrant would most likely-attack-routes with much higher than average-profit-margins . the incumbent would not be able to cohen et al . ( 2000 ) found that less than 16 percent of total u.s . postal-service volume is contestable . respond because of the restrictive uso . ceteris-paribus , the more skewed the incumbent 's route-profit margin distribution , the more vulnerable the post is to entry.23 figure 4 shows that the poste italiane profit margin distribution is much less skewed than the u.s . postal service's distribution . thus , according to the entry-price-measure the cost of the uso is higher in the u.s. than in italy.24 this is contrary to the conclusion that we have drawn in section 3 ( i.e. , that the burden of the uso is much higher for poste italiane than for the u.s . postal-service ) . the possibility of an equal or less efficient-entrant capturing significant-volume depends on the fraction of mail on profitable-routes that is actually-contestable . given the huge-scale-economies of a universal-service-provider and the limited-amount of contestable-mail , it is very difficult for an entrant , at least in the u.s. , to charge prices lower than an incumbent ( cohen et al . 1999 ) . 7 . net avoided cost the net avoided-cost-measure ( nac ) of the uso is the sum of the losses from unprofitable-routes ( dobbs and golay 1995 ; elsenblast and stumpf 1995 ) . as stated earlier , the profits from delivered and non-delivered-mail must equal the upstream fixed-cost in a breakeven-post . if the profits from the money making-routes and non-delivered-mail exceed the upstream fixed-cost , then there must be an offset of money losing-routes . this is simply an accounting identity . the more skewed the distribution of delivery-route-profit margins , the greater will be the losses from unprofitable-routes . figure 4 shows that the nac would be greater for the u.s . postal-service than for poste italiane ( assuming-adjustments for scale ) . again , this is contrary to our finding in section 3 about the relative-burden of the uso . furthermore , we believe that the logic of the nac measure is flawed . suppose that a government decides to provide a subsidy to its breakeven postal-service to offset losses on unprofitable-routes because it wishes taxpayers and not rate-payers to fund the uso . the postal-service would then have a surplus . in order for the postal-service to return to breakeven , prices would be reduced . 25 because of the price-reduction unprofitable-routes would become even more unprofitable and some formerly profitable-routes would become unprofitable . because the total-losses from unprofitable-routes are greater than before , the government would have to increase its subsidy . 23 for purposes of the discussion of entry-pricing and net avoided cost , we ignore the impact of the percentage of non-delivered-mail . 24 bradley and colvin ( 2000 ) estimated the entry-pricing-cost of the uso for the united states . that estimate assumed that the entrant would capture all volume on all profitable-routes . it is a worst case-scenerio . 25 the same logic would hold for a postal-service earning any given profit ( loss ) . this process would continue until there is but one route not subsidized by the government and that route would be the route that initially was the most profitable one in the system . thus , the net avoided-cost-measure implies the absurdity that a government must fund the entire-delivery-network if it wants to fund the cost of universal-service . 8 . conclusion we introduce and quantify the concept of the burden of the uso , which is the upward-impact on unit-costs that would result from competitive-entry . we find that the burden on low per capita postal-systems is much greater than on medium to high volume postal-systems . this is contrary to results obtained when using the net avoided cost or entry-pricing-measures of the cost of the uso . we also find that the burden decreases as the percentage of non-delivered-mail-increases . the distribution of route-profits is much more skewed for the u.s . postal-service than for poste italiane . this would tend to make the u.s. more attractive to potential-cream-skimmers . on the other hand , a greater percentage of poste italiane revenue is generated by delivered mail , and this would cause-cream skimming to have a greater impact on its unit-costs . appendix model definition . the model is designed to define average-unit-cost as a function of volume ( q ) , based on the usps cost-structure for fy 1999 . ac = tc / ( q * p ) where : tc = dc + ndc dc = ( vd / q0 ) q + fd ndc = ( vnd / q0 ) q + [ ( ev fnd ) / q0 ] q + ( 1 - ev ) fnd the functions can be combined and expressed as : tc = { [ v + ( ev fnd ) ] / q0 } q + fd + ( 1 - ev ) fnd the terms are defined as : ac = average-unit-cost d = subscript that indicates delivery component of a cost or volume dc = total-delivery-cost ev = long-run-variability of non-delivery institutional ( fixed ) costs . parametric-values of 0 , 0.25 and 0.5 used in analysis . f = usps fixed-cost for fy 1999 nd = subscript that indicates non-delivery component of a cost or volume ndc = total non-delivery cost p = 1999 u.s. population q = quantity ( volume ) per capita q0 = usps-volume per capita for fy 1999 tc = total-cost v = usps variable-cost for fy 1999 adjustments for differences between the usps and poste italiane significant-differences in the composition of mail and labor costs exist between usps and poste italiane . to make the comparison of the unit-cost from our model ( which is based on usps cost-data ) and the actual-unit-cost of poste italiane more meaningful , we apply three factors to the results of our model . the unit-cost assuming 25 % of institutional ( fixed ) costs vary with volume in the long run is calculated in the example . 1 . first , the attributable ( variable ) cost from the model ( v/q0*p = $ 0.194 ) is adjusted to reflect the different-shape-mix of mail handled by poste italiane . the proportions of letters ( 88 % ) and nonletters ( 12 % ) for poste italiane are applied to the usps variable-unit-cost of each ( 13.46 and 26.60 cents , respectively ) . the weighted-average-unit cost that results ( 15.04 cents ) is then divided by the actual usps unit variable-unit-cost of 16.88 cents . the resulting-ratio ( 0.891 ) is applied to the variable-cost from the model . example : 0.194 * 0.891 = $ 0.173 2 . next , the resulting variable-cost is adjusted to account for the savings from worksharing reflected in the usps costs , which do not exist for poste italiane . the usps variable-costs in fy 1999 were 40 % lower than they would have been without worksharing , ( cohen et al . 2001 ) so the variable-cost from step one ( $ 0.173 ) is increased by that amount . example : $ 0.173 * 1.4 = $ 0.242 3 . finally , both variable and institutional-costs are adjusted for labor-cost-differences . since 78.6 % of usps costs are labor costs , that portion of the variable-cost from step two ( $ 0.242 ) and institutional-cost from the model ( $ 0.662 ) is adjusted by the ratio of poste italiane labor costs to those of usps ( 74.7 % ) . example : [ ( 0.786 ) ( $ 0.242 + $ 0.662 ) ( 0.747 ) ] + [ ( 1 - 0.786 ) ( $ 0.242 + $ 0.662 ) ] = $ 0.724 references berthélémy , francoise l. , and joëlle toledano . 2000 . `` in france , mail goes where the money and businesses are .
