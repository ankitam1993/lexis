7.1 types of dilution-water 7.1.1 the type of dilution-water used in effluent-toxicity-tests will depend largely on the objectives of the study . 7.1.1.1 if the objective of the test is to estimate the absolute chronic-toxicity of the effluent , a synthetic ( standard ) dilution-water is used . if the test-organisms have been cultured in water which is different from the test-dilution-water , a second set of controls , using-culture-water , should be included in the test . 7.1.1.2 if the objective of the test is to estimate the chronic-toxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving-water , the test may be conducted using-dilution-water consisting of a single-grab-sample of receiving-water ( if non-toxic ) , collected either upstream and outside the influence of the outfall , or with other uncontaminated natural-water ( ground or surface-water ) or standard-dilution-water having approximately the same characteristics ( hardness , alkalinity , and conductivity ) as the receiving-water . seasonal-variations in the quality of receiving-waters may affect effluent-toxicity . therefore , the ph , alkalinity , hardness , and conductivity of receiving-water-samples should be determined before each use . if the test-organisms have been cultured in water which is different from the test-dilution-water , a second set of controls , using-culture-water , should be included in the test . 7.1.1.3 if the objective of the test is to determine the additive or mitigating-effects of the discharge on already contaminated receiving-water , the test is performed using-dilution-water consisting of receiving-water collected immediately upstream or outside the influence of the outfall . a second set of controls , using-culture-water , should be included in the test . 7.1.2 an acceptable-dilution-water is one which is appropriate for the objectives of the test ; supports adequate-performance of the test-organisms with respect to survival , growth , reproduction , or other responses that may be measured in the test ( i.e. , consistently meets test-acceptability-criteria for control-responses ) ; is consistent in quality ; and does not contain contaminants that could produce toxicity . receiving-waters , synthetic-waters , or synthetic-waters adjusted to approximate receiving-water-characteristics may be used for dilution provided that the water meets the above listed-qualifications for an acceptable-dilution-water . usepa ( 2000a ) provides additional-guidance on selecting appropriate-dilution-waters . 7.1.3 when dual-controls ( one control using-culture-water and one control using-dilution-water ) are used ( see subsections 7.1.1.1 - 7.1.1.3 above ) , the dilution-water-control should be used to determine test-acceptability . it is also the dilution-water-control that should be compared to effluent-treatments in the calculation and reporting of test results . the culture-water-control should be used to evaluate the appropriateness of the dilution-water-source . significant-differences between organism-responses in culture-water and dilution-water-controls could indicate toxicity in the dilution-water and may suggest an alternative dilution-water-source . usepa ( 2000a ) provides additional-guidance on dual-controls . 7.2 standard , synthetic-dilution-water 7.2.1 standard , synthetic-dilution-water is prepared with deionized-water and reagent-grade-chemicals or mineral-water ( tables 3 and 4 ) . the source-water for the deionizer can be ground-water or tap-water . 7.2.2 deionized-water used to prepare standard , synthetic , dilution-water 7.2.2.1 deionized-water is obtained from a millipore® milli-q® , millipore® qpak™2 or equivalent-system . it is advisable to provide a preconditioned ( deionized ) feed-water by using a culligan® , continental® , or equivalent-system in front of the millipore® system to extend the life of the millipore® cartridges ( see section 5 , facilities , equipment , and supplies ) . 7.2.2.2 the recommended-order of the cartridges in a four-cartridge deionizer ( i.e. , milli-q® system or equivalent ) is ( 1 ) ion exchange , ( 2 ) ion exchange , ( 3 ) carbon , and ( 4 ) organic cleanup ( such as organex-q® , or equivalent ) followed by a final bacteria filter . the qpak™2 water system is a sealed-system which does not allow for the rearranging of the cartridges . however , the final-cartridge is an organex-q® filter , followed by a final bacteria filter . commercial-laboratories using this system have not experienced any difficulty in using the water for culturing or testing . reference to the milli-q® systems throughout the remainder of the manual includes all millipore® or equivalent systems . 7.2.3 standard , synthetic-freshwater 7.2.3.1 to prepare 20 l of synthetic , moderately-hard , reconstituted-water , use the reagent-grade-chemicals in table 3 as follows : 1 . place 19 l of milli-q® , or equivalent , water in a properly cleaned-plastic-carboy . 2 . add 1.20 g of mgso4 , 1.92 g nahco3 , and 0.080g kcl to the carboy . 3 . aerate overnight . 4 . add 1.20 g of caso4•2h20 to 1 l of milli-q® or equivalent deionized-water in a separate-flask . stir on magnetic-stirrer until calcium-sulfate is dissolved , add to the 19 l above , and mix well . 5 . for ceriodaphnia-dubia culturing and testing , add sufficient-sodium-selenate ( na2seo4 ) to provide 2 mg selenium per liter of final-dilution-water . 6 . aerate the combined solution vigorously for an additional 24 h to dissolve the added chemicals and stabilize the medium . 7 . the measured ph , hardness , etc. , should be as listed in table 3 . table 3 . preparation of synthetic-freshwater using-reagent grade chemicals1 1 taken in part from marking and dawson ( 1973 ) . 2 add reagent-grade-chemicals to deionized-water . 3 approximate equilibrium ph after 24 h of aeration . 4 expressed as mg caco3/l . 7.2.3.2 if large-volumes of synthetic reconstituted-water will be needed , it may be advisable to mix 1 l portions of concentrated stock-solutions of nahco3 , mgso4 , and kcl for use in preparation of the reconstituted-waters . 7.2.3.3 to prepare 20 l of standard , synthetic , moderately-hard , reconstituted-water , using-mineral-water such as perrier® water , or equivalent ( table 4 ) , follow the instructions below . 1 . place 16 l of milli-q® or equivalent-water in a properly cleaned-plastic-carboy . 2 . add 4 l of perrier® water , or equivalent . 3 . aerate vigorously for 24 h to stabilize the medium . 4 . the measured ph , hardness and alkalinity of the aerated water will be as indicated in table 4 . 5 . this synthetic-water is referred to as diluted-mineral water ( dmw ) in the toxicity-test-methods . table 4 . preparation of synthetic-freshwater using mineral water1 approximate final water-quality 1 from mount et al . ( 1987 ) , and data provided by philip lewis , emsl-cincinnati , oh . 2 add mineral-water to milli-q® water , or equivalent , to prepare diluted-mineral water ( dmw ) . 3 approximate equilibrium ph after 24 h of aeration . 4 expressed as mg caco3/l . 5 dilutions of perrier® water form a precipitate when concentrations equivalent to `` very hard-water '' are aerated . 7.3 use of receiving-water as dilution-water 7.3.1 if the objectives of the test require the use of uncontaminated receiving-water as dilution-water , and the receiving-water is uncontaminated , it may be possible to collect a sample of the receiving-water upstream of , or close to , but outside of the zone influenced by the effluent . however , if the receiving-water is contaminated , it may be necessary to collect the sample in an area '' remote '' from the discharge-site , matching as closely as possible the physical and chemical-characteristics of the receiving-water near the outfall . 7.3.2 the sample should be collected immediately prior to the test , but never more than 96 h before the test begins . except where it is used within 24 h , or in the case where large-volumes are required for flow-through-tests , the sample should be chilled to 0-6°c during or immediately following-collection , and maintained at that temperature prior to use in the test . 7.3.3 receiving-water containing-debris or indigenous-organisms that may be confused with or attack the test-organisms should be filtered through a sieve having 60 mm-mesh-openings prior to use . 7.3.4 where toxicity-free-dilution-water is required in a test , the water is considered acceptable if test-organisms show the required survival , growth , and reproduction in the controls during the test . 7.3.5 the regulatory-authority may require that the hardness of the dilution-water be comparable to the receiving-water at the discharge-site . this requirement can be satisfied by collecting an uncontaminated receiving-water with a suitable-hardness , or adjusting the hardness of an otherwise-suitable receiving-water by addition of reagents as indicated in table 3 . 7.4 use of tap-water as dilution-water 7.4.1 the use of tap-water as dilution-water is discouraged unless it is dechlorinated and passed through a deionizer and carbon-filter . tap-water can be dechlorinated by deionization , carbon-filtration , or the use of sodium-thiosulfate . use of 3.6 mg/l ( anhydrous ) sodium-thiosulfate will reduce 1.0 mg chlorine/l ( apha , 1992 ) . following-dechlorination , total residual-chlorine should not exceed 0.01 mg/l . because of the possible-toxicity of thiosulfate to test-organisms , a control lacking-thiosulfate should be included in toxicity-tests utilizing thiosulfatedechlorinated water . 7.4.2 to be adequate for general-laboratory-use following-dechlorination , the tap-water is passed through a deionizer and carbon-filter to remove toxic-metals and organics , and to control hardness and alkalinity . 7.5 dilution-water holding 7.5.1 a given batch of dilution-water should not be used for more than 14 days following-preparation because of the possible build-up of bacterial , fungal , or algal-slime-growth and the problems associated with it . the container should be kept covered and the contents should be protected from light . section 8 effluent and receiving-water sampling , sample handling , and sample preparation for toxicity-tests 8.1 effluent-sampling 8.1.1 the effluent-sampling-point should be the same as that specified in the npdes discharge-permit ( usepa , 1988a ) . conditions for exception would be : ( l ) better access to a sampling-point between the final-treatment and the discharge-outfall ; ( 2 ) if the processed waste is chlorinated prior to discharge , it may also be desirable to take samples prior to contact with the chlorine to determine toxicity of the unchlorinated-effluent ; or ( 3 ) in the event there is a desire to evaluate the toxicity of the influent to municipal-waste treatment plants or separate-wastewater-streams in industrial-facilities prior to their being combined with other wastewater-streams or non-contact cooling-water , additional sampling-points may be chosen . 8.1.2 the decision on whether to collect grab or composite-samples is based on the objectives of the test and an understanding of the short and long-term-operations and schedules of the discharger . if the effluent-quality varies considerably with time , which can occur where holding-times are short , grab-samples may seem preferable because of the ease of collection and the potential of observing-peaks ( spikes ) in toxicity . however , the sampling duration of a grab-sample is so short that full-characterization of an effluent over a 24-h period would require a prohibitively-large number of separate-samples and tests . collection of a 24-h composite-sample , however , may dilute toxicity-spikes , and average the quality of the effluent over the sampling-period . sampling recommendations are provided below ( also see usepa , 2002a ) . 8.1.3 aeration during collection and transfer of effluents should be minimized to reduce the loss of volatile-chemicals . 8.1.4 details of date , time , location , duration , and procedures used for effluent-sample and dilution-water-collection should be recorded . 8.2 effluent-sample types 8.2.1 the advantages and disadvantages of effluent-grab and composite-samples are listed below : 8.2.1.1 grab-samples advantages : 1 . easy to collect ; require a minimum of equipment and on-site-time . 2 . provide a measure of instantaneous-toxicity . toxicity-spikes are not masked by dilution . disadvantages : 1 . samples are collected over a very short period of time and on a relatively infrequent-basis . the chances of detecting a spike in toxicity would depend on the frequency of sampling and the probability of missing a spike is high . 8.2.1.2 composite-samples advantages : 1 . a single-effluent sample is collected over a 24-h period . 2 . the sample is collected over a much longer period of time than a single-grab-sample and contains all toxicity-spikes . disadvantages : 1 . sampling-equipment is more sophisticated and expensive , and must be placed on-site for at least 24 h. 2 . toxicity-spikes may not be detected because they are masked by dilution with less toxic-wastes . 8.3 effluent-sampling recommendations 8.3.1 when tests are conducted on-site , test-solutions can be renewed daily with freshly collected samples , except for the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , test which is not renewed . 8.3.2 when tests are conducted off-site , a minimum of three samples are collected . if these samples are collected on test days 1 , 3 , and 5 , the first sample would be used for test-initiation , and for test-solution-renewal on day 2 . the second sample would be used for test-solution-renewal on days 3 and 4 . the third-sample would be used for test-solution-renewal on days 5 , 6 , and 7 . 8.3.3 sufficient-sample-volume must be collected to perform the required toxicity and chemical-tests . a 4-l ( 1gal ) cubitainer® will provide sufficient-sample-volume for most tests . 8.3.4 the following effluent-sampling methods are recommended : 8.3.4.1 continuous-discharges 8.3.4.1.1 if the facility-discharge is continuous , a single 24-h composite-sample is to be taken . 8.3.4.2 intermittent-discharges 8.3.4.2.1 if the facility-discharge is intermittent , a composite-sample is to be collected for the duration of the discharge but not more than 24 hours . 8.4 receiving-water sampling 8.4.1 logistical-problems and difficulty in securing-sampling equipment generally preclude the collection of composite-receiving water-samples for toxicity-tests . therefore , based on the requirements of the test , a single-grab-sample or daily-grab-sample of receiving-water is collected for use in the test . 8.4.2 the sampling-point is determined by the objectives of the test . in rivers , samples should be collected from mid-stream and at mid-depth , if accessible . in lakes the samples are collected at mid-depth . 8.4.3 to determine the extent of the zone of toxicity in the receiving-water-downstream from the outfall , receiving-water-samples are collected at several-distances downstream from the discharge . the time required for the effluent-receiving-water mixture to travel to sampling-points downstream from the outfall , and the rate and degree of mixing , may be difficult to ascertain . therefore , it may not be possible to correlate downstream-toxicity with effluent-toxicity at the discharge-point unless a dye-study is performed . the toxicity of receiving-water-samples from five stations downstream from the discharge-point can be evaluated using the same number of test-vessels and test-organisms as used in one effluent-toxicity-test with five effluent-dilutions . 8.5 effluent and receiving-water-sample handling , preservation , and shipping 8.5.1 unless the samples are used in an on-site-toxicity-test the day of collection ( or hand delivered to the testing-laboratory for use on the day of collection ) , they should be chilled and maintained at 0-6°c until used to inhibit microbial-degradation , chemical-transformations , and loss of highly-volatile toxic-substances . 8.5.2 composite-samples should be chilled as they are collected . grab-samples should be chilled immediately following-collection . 8.5.3 if the effluent has been chlorinated , total residual-chlorine must be measured immediately following-sample collection . 8.5.4 sample-holding-time begins when the last-grab-sample in a series is taken ( i.e. , when a series of four grab-samples are taken over a 24-h period ) , or when a 24-h composite sampling-period is completed . if the data from the samples are to be acceptable for use in the npdes program , the lapsed-time ( holding-time ) from sample-collection to first use of each grab or composite-sample must not exceed 36 h. epa believes that 36 h is adequate-time to deliver the samples to the laboratories performing the test in most cases . in the isolated-cases , where the permittee can document that this delivery-time can not be met , the permitting-authority can allow an option for onsite-testing or a variance for an extension of shipped sample-holding-time . the request for a variance in sample-holding-time , directed to the usepa regional administrator under 40 cfr 136.3 ( e ) should include supportive-data which show that the toxicity of the effluent-sample is not reduced ( e.g. , because of volatilization and/or sorption of toxics on the sample-container surfaces ) by extending the holding-time beyond more than 36 h. however , in no case should more than 72 h elapse between collection and first use of the sample . in static-renewal-tests , each grab or composite-sample may also be used to prepare test-solutions for renewal at 24 h , 48 h , and/or 72 h after first use , if stored at 0-6°c , with minimum-head-space , as described in subsection 8.5 . if shipping-problems ( e.g. , unsuccessful saturday delivery ) are encountered with renewal-samples after a test has been initiated , the permitting-authority may allow the continued use of the most recently used sample for test-renewal . guidance for determining the persistence of the sample is provided in subsection 8.7 . 8.5.5 to minimize the loss of toxicity due to volatilization of toxic-constituents , all sample-containers should be `` completely '' filled , leaving no air-space between the contents and the lid . 8.5.6 samples used in on-site-tests 8.5.6.1 samples collected for on-site-tests should be used within 24 h. 8.5.7 samples shipped to off-site facilities 8.5.7.1 samples collected for off-site-toxicity-testing are to be chilled to 0-6°c during or immediately after collection , and shipped iced to the performing-laboratory . sufficient-ice should be placed with the sample in the shipping-container to ensure that ice will still be present when the sample arrives at the laboratory and is unpacked . insulating-material should not be placed between the ice and the sample in the shipping-container unless required to prevent breakage of glass-sample-containers . 8.5.7.2 samples may be shipped in one or more 4-l ( l-gal ) cubitainers® or new plastic `` milk '' jugs . all sample-containers should be rinsed with source-water before being filled with sample . after use with receiving-water or effluents , cubitainers® and plastic-jugs are punctured to prevent reuse . 8.5.7.3 several sample shipping options are available , including express mail , air express , bus , and courier-service . express mail is delivered seven days a week . saturday and sunday shipping and receiving-schedules of private-carriers vary with the carrier . 8.6 sample receiving 8.6.1 upon arrival at the laboratory , samples are logged in and the temperature is measured and recorded . if the samples are not immediately prepared for testing , they are stored at 0-6°c until used . 8.6.2 every effort must be made to initiate the test with an effluent-sample on the day of arrival in the laboratory , and the sample-holding-time should not exceed 36 h unless a variance has been granted by the npdes permitting-authority . 8.7 persistence of effluent-toxicity during sample-shipment and holding 8.7.1 the persistence of the toxicity of an effluent prior to its use in a toxicity-test is of interest in assessing the validity of toxicity-test-data , and in determining the possible-effects of allowing an extension of the holding-time . where a variance in holding-time ( > 36 h , but # 72 h ) is requested by a permittee , ( see subsection 8.5.4 above ) , information on the effects of the extension in holding-time on the toxicity of samples must be obtained by comparing the results of multi-concentration chronic-toxicity-tests performed on effluent-samples held 36 h with toxicity-test-results using the same samples after they were held for the requested , longer period . the portion of the sample set aside for the second test should be held under the same conditions as during shipment and holding . 8.8 preparation of effluent and receiving-water-samples for toxicity-tests 8.8.1 when aliquots are removed from the sample-container , the head-space above the remaining-sample should be held to a minimum . air which enters a container upon removal of sample should be expelled by compressing the container before reclosing , if possible ( i.e. , where a cubitainer® is used ) , or by using an appropriate discharge-valve ( spigot ) . 8.8.2 with the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , and fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , tests , effluents and receiving-waters should be filtered through a 60-µm plankton net to remove indigenous-organisms that may attack or be confused with the test-organisms ( see the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , test-method for details ) . receiving-waters used in green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , toxicity-tests must be filtered through a 0.45-µm pore diameter filter before use . it may be necessary to first coarse-filter the dilution and/or waste-water through a nylon-sieve having 2- to 4-mm mesh-openings to remove debris and/or break up large floating or suspended solids . because filtration may increase the dissolved oxygen ( do ) in the effluent , the do should be checked both before and after filtering . low dissolved oxygen-concentrations will indicate a potential-problem in performing the test . caution : filtration may remove some toxicity . 8.8.3 if the samples must be warmed to bring them to the prescribed-test-temperature , supersaturation of the dissolved oxygen and nitrogen may become a problem . to avoid this problem , samples may be warmed slowly in open-test-containers . if do is still above 100 % saturation after warming to test temperature , samples should be aerated moderately ( approximately 500 ml/min ) for a few minutes using an airstone . if do is below 4.0 mg/l after warming to test temperature , the solutions must be aerated moderately ( approximately 500 ml/min ) for a few minutes , using an airstone , until the do is within the prescribed-range ( $ 4.0 mg/l ) . caution : avoid excessive-aeration . 8.8.4 the do concentration in the samples should be near saturation prior to use . aeration may be used to bring the do and other gases into equilibrium with air , minimize oxygen-demand , and stabilize the ph . however , aeration during collection , transfer , and preparation of samples should be minimized to reduce the loss of volatile-chemicals . 8.8.4.1 aeration during the test may alter the results and should be used only as a last resort to maintain the required do . aeration can reduce the apparent-toxicity of the test-solutions by stripping them of highly-volatile toxic-substances , or increase their toxicity by altering ph . however , the do in the test-solutions should not be allowed to fall below 4.0 mg/l . 8.8.4.2 in static-tests ( renewal or non-renewal ) , low dos may commonly occur in the higher concentrations of wastewater . aeration is accomplished by bubbling-air through a pipet at a rate of 100 bubbles/min . if aeration is necessary , all test-solutions must be aerated . it is advisable to monitor the do closely during the first few hours of the test . samples with a potential do problem generally show a downward-trend in do within 4 to 8 h after the test is started . unless aeration is initiated during the first 8 h of the test , the do may be exhausted during an unattended-period , thereby invalidating the test . 8.8.5 at a minimum , ph , conductivity , and total residual-chlorine are measured in the undiluted-effluent or receiving-water , and ph and conductivity are measured in the dilution-water . 8.8.5.1 it is recommended that total-alkalinity and total-hardness also be measured in the undiluted-effluent test water , receiving-water , and the dilution-water . 8.8.6 total-ammonia is measured in effluent and receiving-water-samples where toxicity may be contributed by unionized-ammonia ( i.e. , where total-ammonia $ 5 mg/l ) . the concentration ( mg/l ) of un-ionized ( free ) ammonia in a sample is a function of temperature and ph , and is calculated using the percentage-value obtained from table 5 , under the appropriate ph and temperature , and multiplying it by the concentration ( mg/l ) of total-ammonia in the sample . 8.8.7 effluents and receiving-waters can be dechlorinated using 6.7 mg/l anhydrous-sodium thiosulfate to reduce 1 mg/l chlorine ( apha , 1992 ) . note that the amount of thiosulfate required to dechlorinate-effluents is greater than the amount needed to dechlorinate-tap-water ( see section 7 , dilution-water , subsection 7.4.1 ) . since thiosulfate may contribute to sample toxicity , a thiosulfate-control should be used in the test in addition to the normal dilution-water-control . 8.8.8 mortality or impairment of growth or reproduction due to ph alone may occur if the ph of the sample falls outside the range of 6.0 - 9.0 . thus , the presence of other forms of toxicity ( metals and organics ) in the sample may be masked by the toxic-effects of low or high ph . the question about the presence of other toxicants can be answered only by performing two parallel-tests , one with an adjusted ph , and one without an adjusted ph . freshwater-samples are adjusted to ph 7.0 by adding 1n naoh or 1n hcl dropwise , as required , being careful to avoid overadjustment . 1 table provided by teresa norberg-king , erl , duluth , minnesota . also see emerson et al . ( 1975 ) , thurston et al . ( 1974 ) , and usepa ( 1985a ) . 8.9 preliminary-toxicity range-finding tests 8.9.1 usepa regional and state personnel generally have observed that it is not necessary to conduct a toxicity range-finding-test prior to initiating a static , chronic , definitive-toxicity-test . however , when preparing to perform a static-test with a sample of completely unknown-quality , or before initiating a flow-through-test , it is advisable to conduct a preliminary-toxicity range-finding-test . 8.9.2 a toxicity range-finding-test ordinarily consists of a down-scaled , abbreviated static acute-test in which groups of five organisms are exposed to several widely-spaced-sample-dilutions in a logarithmic-series , such as 100 % , 10.0 % , 1.00 % , and 0.100 % , and a control , for 8-24 h. caution : if the sample must also be used for the fullscale definitive-test , the 36-h limit on holding-time ( see subsection 8.5.4 ) must not be exceeded before the definitive-test is initiated . 8.9.3 it should be noted that the toxicity ( lc50 ) of a sample observed in a range-finding-test may be significantly-different from the toxicity observed in the follow-up chronic definitive-test because : ( 1 ) the definitive-test is longer ; and ( 2 ) the test may be performed with a sample collected at a different-time , and possibly differing significantly in the level of toxicity . 8.10 multi-concentration ( definitive ) effluent-toxicity-tests 8.10.1 the tests recommended for use in determining-discharge permit compliance in the npdes program are multi-concentration , or definitive , tests which provide ( 1 ) a point-estimate of effluent-toxicity in terms of an ic25 , ic50 , or lc50 , or ( 2 ) a no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) defined in terms of mortality , growth , reproduction , and/or teratogenicity and obtained by hypothesis-testing . the tests may be static-renewal or static-non-renewal . 8.10.2 the tests consist of a control and a minimum of five effluent-concentrations . usepa recommends the use of a $ 0.5 dilution-factor for selecting effluent-test-concentrations . effluent-test-concentrations of 6.25 % , 12.5 % , 25 % , 50 % , and 100 % are commonly used , however , test-concentrations should be selected independently for each test based on the objective of the study , the expected-range of toxicity , the receiving-water-concentration , and any available historical-testing-information on the effluent . usepa ( 2000a ) provides additional-guidance on choosing appropriate test-concentrations . 8.10.3 when these tests are used in determining-compliance with permit-limits , effluent-test-concentrations should be selected to bracket the receiving-water-concentration . this may be achieved by selecting effluent-test-concentrations in the following-manner : ( 1 ) 100 % effluent , ( 2 ) [ rwc + 100 ] /2 , ( 3 ) rwc , ( 4 ) rwc/2 , and ( 5 ) rwc/4 . for example , where the rwc = 50 % , appropriate-effluent concentrations may be 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % , and 12.5 % . 8.10.4 if acute/chronic ratios are to be determined by simultaneous acute and short-term chronic-tests with a single-species , using the same sample , both types of tests must use the same test-conditions , i.e. , ph , temperature , water-hardness , salinity , etc . 8.11 receiving-water-tests 8.11.1 receiving-water toxicity-tests generally consist of 100 % receiving-water and a control . the total-hardness of the control should be comparable to the receiving-water . 8.11.2 the data from the two treatments are analyzed by hypothesis-testing to determine if test-organism-survival in the receiving-water differs significantly from the control . four replicates and 10 organisms per replicate are required for each treatment ( see summary of test-conditions and test-acceptability-criteria in the specific-test-method ) . 8.11.3 in cases where the objective of the test is to estimate the degree of toxicity of the receiving-water , a multiconcentration-test is performed by preparing-dilutions of the receiving-water , using a $ 0.5 dilution-series , with a suitable-control water . section 9 chronic-toxicity-test endpoints and data-analysis 9.1 endpoints 9.1.1 the objective of chronic aquatic-toxicity-tests with effluents and pure-compounds is to estimate the highest `` safe '' or '' no-effect-concentration '' of these substances . for practical reasons , the responses observed in these tests are usually-limited to hatchability , gross morphological-abnormalities , survival , growth , and reproduction , and the results of the tests are usually expressed in terms of the highest toxicant-concentration that has no statistically-significant observed-effect on these responses , when compared to the controls . the terms currently used to define the endpoints employed in the rapid , chronic and sub-chronic toxicity-tests have been derived from the terms previously used for full-life-cycle-tests . as shorter chronic-tests were developed , it became common-practice to apply the same terminology to the endpoints . the terms used in this manual are as follows : 9.1.1.1 safe-concentration - the highest concentration of toxicant that will permit normal-propagation of fish and other aquatic-life in receiving-waters . the concept of a `` safe-concentration '' is a biological-concept , whereas the '' no-observed-effect-concentration '' ( below ) is a statistically defined concentration . 9.1.1.2 no-observed-effect-concentration ( noec ) - the highest concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a full-life-cycle or partial-life-cycle ( short-term ) test , that causes no observable adverse-effects on the test-organisms ( i.e. , the highest concentration of toxicant in which the values for the observed-responses are not statistically significantly-different from the controls ) . this value is used , along with other factors , to determine toxicity-limits in permits . 9.1.1.3 lowest-observed-effect-concentration ( loec ) - the lowest concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a life-cycle or partial-life-cycle ( short-term ) test , which causes adverse-effects on the test-organisms ( i.e. , where the values for the observed-responses are statistically significantly-different from the controls ) . 9.1.1.4 effective-concentration ( ec ) - a point-estimate of the toxicant-concentration that would cause an observable adverse-affect on a quantal , `` all or nothing , '' response ( such as death , immobilization , or serious-incapacitation ) in a given percent of the organisms , calculated by point-estimation-techniques . if the observable-effect is death or immobility , the term , lethal-concentration ( lc ) , should be used ( see subsection 9.1.1.5 ) . a certain ec or lc value might be judged from a biological-standpoint to represent a threshold-concentration , or lowest concentration that would cause an adverse-effect on the observed response . 9.1.1.5 lethal-concentration ( lc ) - the toxicant-concentration that would cause-death in a given percent of the test-population . identical to ec when the observed adverse-effect is death . for example , the lc50 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause-death in 50 % of the test-population . 9.1.1.6 inhibition-concentration ( ic ) - the toxicant-concentration that would cause a given percent-reduction in a non-quantal biological-measurement for the test-population . for example , the ic25 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause a 25 % reduction in mean young per female or in growth for the test-population , and the ic50 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause a 50 % reduction . 9.2 relationship between endpoints determined by hypothesis-testing and point-estimation-techniques 9.2.1 if the objective of chronic aquatic-toxicity-tests with effluents and pure-compounds is to estimate the highest `` safe or no-effect-concentration '' of these substances , it is imperative to understand how the statistical-endpoints of these tests are related to the `` safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration . noecs and loecs are determined by hypothesis-testing ( dunnett 's test , a t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment , steel 's many-one rank test , or the wilcoxon rank sum test with the bonferroni-adjustment ) , whereas lcs , ics , and ecs are determined by point-estimation-techniques ( probit analysis , spearman-karber-method , trimmed spearman-karber-method , graphical-method or linear-interpolation-method ) . there are inherent-differences between the use of a noec or loec derived from hypothesis-testing to estimate a `` safe '' concentration , and the use of a lc , ec , ic , or other point-estimates derived from curve fitting , interpolation , etc . 9.2.2 most point-estimates , such as the lc , ic , or ec , are derived from a mathematical-model that assumes a continuous-dose-response-relationship . by definition , any lc , ic , or ec value is an estimate of some amount of adverse-effect . thus the assessment of a `` safe '' concentration must be made from a biological-standpoint rather than with a statistical-test . in this instance , the biologist must determine some amount of adverse-effect that is deemed to be `` safe '' , in the sense that from a practical biological viewpoint it will not affect the normal-propagation of fish and other aquatic-life in receiving-waters . 9.2.3 the use of noecs and loecs , on the other hand , assumes either ( 1 ) a continuous-dose-response-relationship , or ( 2 ) a non-continuous ( threshold ) model of the dose-response-relationship . 9.2.3.1 in the case of a continuous-dose-response-relationship , it is also assumed that adverse-effects that are not `` statistically-observable '' are also not important from a biological-standpoint , since they are not pronounced enough to test as statistically-significant against some measure of the natural-variability of the responses . 9.2.3.2 in the case of non-continuous-dose-response relationships , it is assumed that there exists a true-threshold , or concentration below which there is no adverse-effect on aquatic-life , and above which there is an adverse-effect . the purpose of the statistical-analysis in this case is to estimate as closely as possible where that threshold lies . 9.2.3.3 in either case , it is important to realize that the amount of adverse-effect that is statistically-observable ( loec ) or not observable ( noec ) is highly-dependent on all aspects of the experimental-design , such as the number of concentrations of toxicant , number of replicates per concentration , number of organisms per replicate , and use of randomization . other factors that affect the sensitivity of the test include the choice of statistical-analysis , the choice of an alpha-level , and the amount of variability between responses at a given concentration . 9.2.3.4 where the assumption of a continuous-dose-response-relationship is made , by definition some amount of adverse-effect might be present at the noec , but is not great enough to be detected by hypothesis-testing . 9.2.3.5 where the assumption of a non-continuous-dose-response relationship is made , the noec would indeed be an estimate of a '' safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration if the amount of adverse-effect that appears at the threshold is great enough to test as statistically significantly-different from the controls in the face of all aspects of the experimental-design mentioned above . if , however , the amount of adverse-effect at the threshold were not great enough to test as statistically-different , some amount of adverse-effect might be present at the noec . in any case , the estimate of the noec with hypothesis-testing is always-dependent on the aspects of the experimental-design mentioned above . for this reason , the reporting and examination of some measure of the sensitivity of the test ( either the minimum significant-difference or the percent-change from the control that this minimum-difference represents ) is extremely-important . 9.2.4 in summary , the assessment of a `` safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration can not be made from the results of statistical-analysis alone , unless ( 1 ) the assumptions of a strict-threshold model are accepted , and ( 2 ) it is assumed that the amount of adverse-effect present at the threshold is statistically-detectable by hypothesis-testing . in this case , estimates obtained from a statistical-analysis are indeed-estimates of a `` no-effect '' concentration . if the assumptions are not deemed tenable , then estimates from a statistical-analysis can only be used in conjunction with an assessment from a biological-standpoint of what magnitude of adverse-effect constitutes a `` safe '' concentration . in this instance , a `` safe '' concentration is not necessarily a truly '' no-effect '' concentration , but rather a concentration at which the effects are judged to be of no biological-significance . 9.2.5 a better understanding of the relationship between endpoints derived by hypothesis-testing ( noecs ) and point-estimation-techniques ( lcs , ics , and ecs ) would be very helpful in choosing-methods of data-analysis . norberg-king ( 1991 ) reported that the ic25s were comparable to the noecs for 23 effluent and reference-toxicant data-sets analyzed . the data-sets included short-term-chronic-toxicity tests for the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , and the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia . birge et al . ( 1985 ) reported that lc1s derived from probit analysis of data from short-term embryo-larval-tests with reference-toxicants were comparable to noecs for several-organisms . similarly , usepa ( 1988d ) reported that the ic25s were comparable to the noecs for a set of daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , chronic-tests with a single-reference-toxicant . however , the scope of these comparisons was very limited , and sufficient-information is not yet-available to establish an overall-relationship between these two types of endpoints , especially when derived from effluent-toxicity-test data . 9.3 precision 9.3.1 hypothesis-tests 9.3.1.1 when hypothesis-tests are used to analyze toxicity-test-data , it is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly used statistic . the results of the test are given in terms of two endpoints , the no-observed- effect-concentration ( noec ) and the lowest-observed-effect-concentration ( loec ) . the noec and loec are limited to the concentrations selected for the test . the width of the noec-loec interval is a function of the dilution-series , and differs greatly depending on whether a dilution-factor of 0.3 or 0.5 is used in the test-design . therefore , usepa recommends the use of the $ 0.5 dilution-factor ( see section 4 , quality-assurance ) . it is not possible to place confidence-limits on the noec and loec derived from a given test , and it is difficult to quantify the precision of the noec-loec endpoints between tests . if the data from a series of tests performed with the same toxicant , toxicant-concentrations , and test-species , were analyzed with hypothesis-tests , precision could only be assessed by a qualitative-comparison of the noec-loec intervals , with the understanding that maximum-precision would be attained if all tests yielded the same noec-loec interval . in practice , the precision of results of repetitive chronic-tests is considered acceptable if the noecs vary by no more than one concentration-interval above or below a central-tendency . using these guidelines , the `` normal '' range of noecs from toxicity-tests using a 0.5 dilution-factor ( two-fold-difference between adjacent-concentrations ) , would be four-fold . 9.3.2 point-estimation-techniques 9.3.2.1 point-estimation-techniques have the advantage of providing a point-estimate of the toxicant-concentration causing a given amount of adverse ( inhibiting ) effect , the precision of which can be quantitatively assessed ( 1 ) within tests by calculation of 95 % confidence-limits , and ( 2 ) across tests by calculating a standard-deviation and coefficient of variation . 9.3.2.2 it should be noted that software used to calculate point-estimates occasionally may not provide associated 95 % confidence-intervals . this situation may arise when test-data do not meet specific-assumptions required by the statistical-methods , when point-estimates are outside of the test-concentration-range , and when specific-limitations imposed by the software are encountered . usepa ( 2000a ) provides guidance on confidence-intervals under these circumstances . 9.4 data-analysis 9.4.1 role of the statistician 9.4.1.1 the use of the statistical-methods described in this manual for routine-data-analysis does not require the assistance of a statistician . however , the interpretation of the results of the analysis of the data from any of the toxicity-tests described in this manual can become problematic because of the inherent variability and sometimes unavoidable-anomalies in biological-data . if the data appear unusual in any way , or fail to meet the necessary-assumptions , a statistician should be consulted . analysts who are not proficient in statistics are strongly advised to seek the assistance of a statistician before selecting the method of analysis and using any of the results . 9.4.1.2 the statistical-methods recommended in this manual are not the only possible-methods of statistical-analysis . many other methods have been proposed and considered . certainly there are other reasonable and defensible-methods of statistical-analysis for this kind of toxicity-data . among alternative-hypothesis-tests some , like williams ' test , require additional-assumptions , while others , like the bootstrap-methods , require computerintensive computations . alternative point-estimation-approaches most probably would require the services of a statistician to determine the appropriateness of the model ( goodness of fit ) , higher order-linear or nonlinear-models , confidence-intervals for estimates generated by inverse-regression , etc . in addition , point-estimation or regression-approaches would require the specification by biologists or toxicologists of some low-level of adverse-effect that would be deemed acceptable or safe . the statistical-methods contained in this manual have been chosen because they are ( 1 ) applicable to most of the different toxicity-test-data sets for which they are recommended , ( 2 ) powerful statistical-tests , ( 3 ) hopefully `` easily '' understood by nonstatisticians , and ( 4 ) amenable to use without a computer , if necessary . 9.4.2 plotting the data 9.4.2.1 the data should be plotted , both as a preliminary-step to help detect problems and unsuspected-trends or patterns in the responses , and as an aid in interpretation of the results . further discussion and plotted-sets of data are included in the methods and the appendices . 9.4.3 data transformations 9.4.3.1 transformations of the data , ( e.g. , arc-sine square-root and logs ) , are used where necessary to meet assumptions of the proposed analyses , such as the requirement for normally distributed data . 9.4.4 independence , randomization , and outliers 9.4.4.1 statistical-independence among observations is a critical assumption in all statistical-analysis of toxicity-data . one of the best ways to insure independence is to properly follow rigorous randomization-procedures . randomization-techniques should be employed at the start of the test , including the randomization of the placement of test-organisms in the test-chambers and randomization of the test-chamber-location within the array of chambers . discussions of statistical-independence , outliers and randomization , and a sample-randomization-scheme , are included in appendix a . 9.4.5 replication and sensitivity 9.4.5.1 the number of replicates employed for each toxicant-concentration is an important-factor in determining the sensitivity of chronic-toxicity-tests . test-sensitivity generally increases as the number of replicates is increased , but the point of diminishing-returns in sensitivity may be reached rather quickly . the level of sensitivity required by a hypothesis-test or the confidence-interval for a point-estimate will determine the number of replicates , and should be based on the objectives for obtaining the toxicity-data . 9.4.5.2 in a statistical-analysis of toxicity-data , the choice of a particular-analysis and the ability to detect departures from the assumptions of the analysis , such as the normal-distribution of the data and homogeneity of variance , is also dependent on the number of replicates . more than the minimum-number of replicates may be required in situations where it is imperative to obtain optimal statistical-results , such as with tests used in enforcement-cases or when it is not possible to repeat the tests . for example , when the data are analyzed by hypothesis-testing , the nonparametric alternatives can not be used unless there are at least four replicates at each toxicant-concentration . 9.4.6 recommended alpha levels 9.4.6.1 the data-analysis-examples included in the manual specify an alpha-level of 0.01 for testing the assumptions of hypothesis-tests and an alpha-level of 0.05 for the hypothesis-tests themselves . these levels are common and well accepted levels for this type of analysis and are presented as a recommended-minimum significance-level for toxicity-test-data analysis . 9.5 choice of analysis 9.5.1 the recommended statistical-analysis of most data from chronic-toxicity-tests with aquatic-organisms follows a decision-process illustrated in the flowchart in figure 2 . an initial decision is made to use point-estimation-techniques ( the probit analysis , the spearman-karber-method , the trimmed spearman-karber-method , the graphical-method , or linear-interpolation-method ) and/or to use hypothesis-testing ( dunnett 's test , the t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment , steel 's many-one rank test , or the wilcoxon rank sum test with the bonferroni-adjustment ) . note : for the npdes permit-program , the point-estimation-techniques are the preferred statistical-methods in calculating-end-points for effluent-toxicity-tests . if hypothesis-testing is chosen , subsequent-decisions are made on the appropriate-procedure for a given set of data , depending on the results of the tests of assumptions , as illustrated in the flowchart . a specific-flow-chart is included in the analysis-section for each test . 9.5.2 since a single chronic-toxicity-test might yield information on more than one parameter ( such as survival , growth , and reproduction ) , the lowest estimate of a `` no-observed-effect-concentration '' for any of the responses would be used as the '' no-observed-effect-concentration '' for each test . it follows logically that in the statistical-analysis of the data , concentrations that had a significant toxic-effect on one of the observed-responses would not be subsequently tested for an effect on some other response . this is one reason for excluding-concentrations that have shown a statistically-significant reduction in survival from a subsequent-hypothesis-test for effects on another parameter such as reproduction . a second reason is that the exclusion of such concentrations usually results in a more powerful and appropriate statistical-analysis . in performing the point-estimation-techniques recommended in this manual , an all-data-approach is used . for example , data from concentrations above the noec for survival are included in determining icp estimates using the linear-interpolation-method . 9.5.3 analysis of growth and reproduction-data 9.5.3.1 growth-data from the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , larval-survival and growth-test are analyzed using-hypothesis-testing or point-estimation-techniques according to the flowchart in figure 2 . the above mentioned growth-data may also be analyzed by generating a point-estimate with the linear-interpolation-method . data from effluent-concentrations that have tested significantly-different from the control for survival are excluded from further hypothesis-tests concerning-growth-effects . growth is defined as the dry-weight per original-number of test-organisms when group-weights are obtained . when analyzing the data using-point-estimation techniques , data from all concentrations are included in the analysis . 9.5.3.2 reproduction-data from the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , survival and reproduction-test are analyzed using-hypothesis-testing or point-estimation-techniques according to the flowchart in figure 2 . in hypothesis-testing , data from effluent-concentrations that have significantly lower survival than the control , as determined by fisher 's exact-test , are not included in the hypothesis-tests for reproductive-effects . data from all concentrations are included when using-point-estimation techniques . 9.5.4 analysis of algal-growth response data 9.5.4.1 the growth-response-data from the green-alga , selenastrum-capricornutum , toxicity-test , after an appropriate-transformation , if necessary , to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance , may be analyzed by hypothesis-testing according to the flowchart in figure 2 . point-estimates , such as the ic25 and ic50 , would also be appropriate in analyzing algal-growth data . 9.5.5 analysis of mortality-data 9.5.5.1 mortality-data are analyzed by probit analysis , if appropriate , or other point-estimation-techniques ( i.e. , the spearman-karber-method , the trimmed spearman-karber-method , or the graphical-method ) ( see appendices i-l and the discussion below ) . the mortality-data can also be analyzed by hypothesis-testing , after an arc-sine square-root-transformation ( see appendix b-f ) , according to the flowchart in figure 2 . 9.5.5.2 mortality-data from the daphnid , ceriodaphnia-dubia , survival and reproduction-test are analyzed by fisher 's exact-test ( appendix g ) prior to the analysis of the reproduction-data . the mortality-data may also be analyzed by probit analysis , if appropriate or other methods ( see subsection 9.5.5.1 ) . 9.6 hypothesis-tests 9.6.1 dunnett 's procedure 9.6.1.1 dunnett 's procedure is used to determine the noec . the procedure consists of an analysis of variance ( anova ) to determine the error-term , which is then used in a multiple-comparison procedure for comparing each of the treatment means with the control mean , in a series of paired tests ( see appendix c ) . use of dunnett 's procedure requires at least three replicates per treatment to check the assumptions of the test . in cases where the numbers of data-points ( replicates ) for each concentration are not equal , a t-test may be performed with bonferroni 's adjustment for multiple-comparisons ( see appendix d ) , instead of using dunnett's procedure . 9.6.1.2 the assumptions upon which the use of dunnett 's procedure is contingent are that the observations within treatments are normally distributed , with homogeneity of variance . before analyzing the data , these assumptions must be tested using the procedures provided in appendix b . 9.6.1.3 if , after suitable-transformations have been carried out , the normality-assumptions have not been met , steel 's many-one rank test should be used if there are four or more data-points ( replicates ) per toxicant-concentration . if the numbers of data-points for each toxicant-concentration are not equal , the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni 's adjustment should be used ( see appendix f ) . 9.6.1.4 some indication of the sensitivity of the analysis should be provided by calculating ( 1 ) the minimum-difference between means that can be detected as statistically-significant , and ( 2 ) the percent-change from the control mean that this minimum-difference represents for a given test . 9.6.1.5 a step-by-step-example of the use of dunnett 's procedure is provided in appendix c. 9.6.2 t-test with the bonferroni-adjustment 9.6.2.1 a t-test with bonferroni 's adjustment is used as an alternative to dunnett 's procedure when the number of replicates is not the same for all concentrations . this test sets an upper-bound of alpha on the overall-error-rate , in contrast to dunnett's procedure , for which the overall-error-rate is fixed at alpha . thus dunnett 's procedure is a more powerful-test . 9.6.2.2 the assumptions upon which the use of the t-test with bonferroni 's adjustment is contingent are that the observations within treatments are normally distributed , with homogeneity of variance . these assumptions must be tested using the procedures provided in appendix b . 9.6.2.3 the estimate of the safe-concentration derived from this test is reported in terms of the noec . a step-by-step-example of the use of the t-test with bonferroni 's adjustment is provided in appendix d. 9.6.3 steel 's many-one rank test 9.6.3.1 steel 's many-one rank test is a multiple-comparison procedure for comparing several-treatments with a control . this method is similar to dunnett 's procedure , except that it is not necessary to meet the assumption of normality . the data are ranked , and the analysis is performed on the ranks rather than on the data themselves . if the data are normally or nearly normally distributed , dunnett 's procedure would be more sensitive ( would detect smaller differences between the treatments and control ) . for data that are not normally distributed , steel 's many-one rank test can be much more efficient ( hodges and lehmann , 1956 ) . 9.6.3.2 it is necessary to have at least four replicates per toxicant-concentration to use steel 's test . unlike dunnett's procedure , the sensitivity of this test can not be stated in terms of the minimum-difference between treatment means and the control mean that can be detected as statistically-significant . 9.6.3.3 the estimate of the safe-concentration is reported as the noec . a step-by-step-example of the use of steel 's many-one rank test is provided in appendix e. 9.6.4 wilcoxon rank sum test with the bonferroni-adjustment 9.6.4.1 the wilcoxon rank sum test with the bonferroni-adjustment is a nonparametric-test for comparing-treatments with a control . the data are ranked and the analysis proceeds exactly as in steel's test except that bonferroni 's adjustment for multiple-comparisons is used instead of steel 's tables . when steel 's test can be used ( i.e. , when there are equal-numbers of data-points per toxicant-concentration ) , it will be more powerful ( able to detect smaller differences as statistically-significant ) than the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni 's adjustment . 9.6.4.2 the estimate of the safe-concentration is reported as the noec . a step-by-step-example of the use of the wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni-adjustment is provided in appendix f. 9.6.5 a caution in the use of hypothesis-testing 9.6.5.1 if in the calculation of an noec by hypothesis-testing , two tested-concentrations-cause statistically-significant adverse-effects , but an intermediate-concentration did not cause statistically-significant effects , the results should be used with extreme-caution . 9.7 point-estimation-techniques 9.7.1 probit analysis 9.7.1.1 probit analysis is used to estimate the lc1 , lc50 , ec1 , or ec50 and the associated 95 % confidence-interval . the analysis consists of adjusting the data for mortality in the control , and then using a maximum-likelihood-technique to estimate the parameters of the underlying log tolerance distribution , which is assumed to have a particular-shape . 9.7.1.2 the assumption upon which the use of probit analysis is contingent is a normal-distribution of log-tolerances . if the normality-assumption is not met , and at least two partial-mortalities are not obtained , probit analysis should not be used . it is important to check the results of probit analysis to determine if use of the analysis is appropriate . the chi-square test for heterogeneity provides one good-test of appropriateness of the analysis . the computer-program ( see appendix i ) checks the chi-square-statistic calculated for the data-set against the tabular-value , and provides an error-message if the calculated value exceeds the tabular-value . 9.7.1.3 a discussion of probit analysis , and examples of computer-program input and output , are found in appendix i . 9.7.1.4 in cases where probit analysis is not appropriate , the lc50 and associated confidence-interval may be estimated by the spearman-karber-method ( appendix j ) or the trimmed spearman-karber-method ( appendix k ) . if the test results in 100 % survival and 100 % mortality in adjacent-treatments ( all or nothing-effect ) , the lc50 may be estimated using the graphical-method ( appendix l ) . 9.7.2 linear-interpolation-method 9.7.2.1 the linear-interpolation-method ( see appendix m ) is a procedure to calculate a point-estimate of the effluent or other toxicant-concentration [ inhibition-concentration , ( ic ) ] that causes a given percent-reduction ( e.g. , 25 % , 50 % , etc . ) in the reproduction or growth of the test-organisms . the procedure was designed for general-applicability in the analysis of data from short-term-chronic-toxicity tests . 9.7.2.2 use of the linear-interpolation-method is based on the assumptions that the responses ( 1 ) are monotonically non-increasing ( the mean-response for each higher concentration is less than or equal to the mean-response for the previous-concentration ) , ( 2 ) follow a piecewise linear-response-function , and ( 3 ) are from a random , independent , and representative-sample of test-data . the assumption for piecewise linear-response can not be tested statistically , and no defined statistical-procedure is provided to test the assumption for monotonicity . where the observed-means are not strictly monotonic by examination , they are adjusted by smoothing . in cases where the responses at the low-toxicant concentrations are much higher than in the controls , the smoothing process may result in a large upward-adjustment in the control mean . 9.7.2.3 the inability to test the monotonicity and piecewise linear-response-assumptions for this method makes it difficult to assess when the method is , or is not , producing reliable-results . therefore , the method should be used with caution when the results of a toxicity-test-approach an `` all or nothing '' response from one concentration to the next in the concentration-series , and when it appears that there is a large-deviation from monotonicity . see appendix m for a more detailed-discussion of the use of this method and a computer-program available for performing calculations . section 10 report preparation and test-review 10.1 report preparation the following general-format and content are recommended for the report :

test-review should be conducted on each test by both the testing-laboratory and the regulatory-authority . 10.2.2 sampling and handling 10.2.2.1 the collection and handling of samples are reviewed to verify that the sampling and handling-procedures given in section 8 were followed . chain-of-custody-forms are reviewed to verify that samples were tested within allowable-sample holding-times ( subsection 8.5.4 ) . any deviations from the procedures given in section 8 should be documented and described in the data-report ( subsection 10.1 ) . 10.2.3 test-acceptability-criteria 10.2.3.1 test-data are reviewed to verify that test-acceptability-criteria ( tac ) requirements for a valid-test have been met . any test not meeting the minimum test-acceptability-criteria is considered invalid . all invalid-tests must be repeated with a newly collected sample . 10.2.4 test-conditions 10.2.4.1 test-conditions are reviewed and compared to the specifications listed in the summary of test-condition-tables provided for each method . physical and chemical-measurements taken during the test ( e.g. , temperature , ph , and do ) also are reviewed and compared to specified-ranges . any deviations from specifications should be documented and described in the data-report ( subsection 10.1 ) . 10.2.4.2 the summary of test-condition-tables presented for each method identify test-conditions as required or recommended . for wet-test-data submitted under npdes-permits , all required-test conditions must be met or the test is considered invalid and must be repeated with a newly collected sample . deviations from recommended test-conditions must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the validity of test results . deviations from recommended test-conditions may or may not invalidate a test-result depending on the degree of the departure and the objective of the test . the reviewer should consider the degree of the deviation and the potential or observed-impact of the deviation on the test-result before rejecting or accepting a test-result as valid . for example , if dissolved oxygen is measured below 4.0 mg/l in one test-chamber , the reviewer should consider whether any observed mortality in that test-chamber corresponded with the drop in dissolved oxygen . 10.2.4.3 whereas slight-deviations in test-conditions may not invalidate an individual-test-result , test-condition-deviations that continue to occur frequently in a given laboratory may indicate the need for improved-quality control in that laboratory . 10.2.5 statistical-methods 10.2.5.1 the statistical-methods used for analyzing-test-data are reviewed to verify that the recommended flowcharts for statistical-analysis were followed . any deviation from the recommended flowcharts for selection of statistical-methods should be noted in the data-report . statistical-methods other than those recommended in the statistical-flowcharts may be appropriate ( see subsection 9.4.1.2 ) , however , the laboratory must document the use of and provide the rationale for the use of any alternate statistical-method . in all cases ( flowchart recommended-methods or alternate-methods ) , reviewers should verify that the necessary-assumptions are met for the statistical-method used . 10.2.6 concentration-response-relationships 10.2.6.1 the concept of a concentration-response , or more classically , a dose-response-relationship is `` the most fundamental and pervasive one in toxicology '' ( casarett and doull , 1975 ) . this concept assumes that there is a causal-relationship between the dose of a toxicant ( or concentration for toxicants in solution ) and a measured response . a response may be any measurable-biochemical or biological-parameter that is correlated with exposure to the toxicant . the classical-concentration-response-relationship is depicted as a sigmoidal shaped-curve , however , the particular-shape of the concentration-response-curve may differ for each coupled toxicant and response-pair . in general , more severe-responses ( such as acute-effects ) occur at higher concentrations of the toxicant , and less severe-responses ( such as chronic-effects ) occur at lower concentrations . a single-toxicant also may produce multiple responses , each characterized by a concentration-response-relationship . a corollary of the concentration-response-concept is that every toxicant should exhibit a concentration-response-relationship , given that the appropriate-response is measured and given that the concentration-range evaluated is appropriate . use of this concept can be helpful in determining whether an effluent possesses toxicity and in identifying anomalous-test results . 10.2.6.2 the concentration-response-relationship generated for each multi-concentration-test must be reviewed to ensure that calculated-test-results are interpreted appropriately . usepa ( 2000a ) provides guidance on evaluating-concentration-response relationships to assist in determining the validity of wet-test-results . all wet-test-results ( from multi-concentration-tests ) reported under the npdes program should be reviewed and reported according to usepa guidance on the evaluation of concentration-response-relationships ( usepa , 2000a ) . this guidance provides review-steps for 10 different-concentration-response patterns that may be encountered in wet-test-data . based on the review , the guidance provides one of three determinations : that calculated-effect-concentrations are reliable and should be reported , that calculated-effect-concentrations are anomalous and should be explained , or that the test was inconclusive and the test should be repeated with a newly collected sample . it should be noted that the determination of a valid-concentration-response relationship is not always-clear cut . data from some tests may suggest consultation with professional-toxicologists and/or regulatory-officials . tests that exhibit unexpected concentration-response-relationships also may indicate a need for further investigation and possible-retesting . 10.2.7 reference-toxicant testing 10.2.7.1 test-review of a given effluent or receiving-water-test should include review of the associated-reference toxicant-test and current-control-chart . reference-toxicant testing and control-charting is required for documenting the quality of test-organisms ( subsection 4.7 ) and ongoing-laboratory-performance ( subsection 4.16 ) . the reviewer should verify that a quality-control-reference toxicant-test was conducted according to the specified-frequency required by the permitting-authority or recommended by the method ( e.g. , monthly ) . the test-acceptability-criteria , test-conditions , concentration-response-relationship , and test-sensitivity of the reference-toxicant test are reviewed to verify that the reference-toxicant test conducted was a valid-test . the results of the reference-toxicant test are then plotted on a control-chart ( see subsection 4.16 ) and compared to the current-control-chart limits ( ± 2 standard-deviations ) . 10.2.7.2 reference-toxicant tests that fall outside of recommended control-chart-limits are evaluated to determine the validity of associated effluent and receiving-water-tests ( see subsection 4.16 ) . an out of control reference-toxicant test-result does not necessarily invalidate associated-test-results . the reviewer should consider the degree to which the reference-toxicant test-result fell outside of control-chart-limits , the width of the limits , the direction of the deviation ( toward increasing-test-organism sensitivity or toward decreasing-test organism-sensitivity ) , the test-conditions of both the effluent-test and the reference-toxicant test , and the objective of the test . more frequent and/or concurrent-reference toxicant-testing may be advantageous if recent-problems ( e.g. , invalid-tests , reference-toxicant test results outside of control-chart-limits , reduced health of organism cultures , or increased within-test-variability ) have been identified in testing . 10.2.8 test-variability 10.2.8.1 the within-test-variability of individual-tests should be reviewed . excessive-within-test-variability may invalidate a test-result and warrant retesting . for evaluating-within-test variability , reviewers should consult epa guidance on upper and lower percent-minimum significant-difference ( pmsd ) bounds ( usepa , 2000b ) . 10.2.8.2 when npdes-permits require sublethal-hypothesis-testing endpoints from methods 1000.0,1002.0 , or 1003.0 ( e.g. , growth or reproduction-noecs and loecs ) , within-test-variability must be reviewed and variability-criteria must be applied as described in this section ( 10.2.8.2 ) . when the methods are used for non-regulatory-purposes , the variability-criteria-herein are recommended but are not required , and their use ( or the use of alternative-variability-criteria ) may depend upon the intended uses of the test results and the requirements of any applicable-data quality-objectives and quality-assurance-plan . 10.2.8.2.1 to measure test-variability , calculate the percent-minimum significant-difference ( pmsd ) achieved in the test . the pmsd is the smallest percentage-decrease in growth or reproduction from the control that could be determined as statistically-significant in the test . the pmsd is calculated as 100 times the minimum significant-difference ( msd ) divided by the control mean . the equation and examples of msd calculations are shown in appendix c. pmsd may be calculated legitimately as a descriptive-statistic for within-test-variability , even when the hypothesis-test is conducted using a non-parametric-method . the pmsd bounds were based on a representative-set of tests , including-tests for which a non-parametric-method was required for determining the noec or loec . the conduct of hypothesis-testing to determine test results should follow the statistical-flow-charts provided for each method . that is , when test-data fail to meet assumptions of normality or heterogeneity of variance , a nonparametric-method ( determined following the statistical-flowchart for the method ) should be used to calculate test results , but the pmsd may be calculated as described above ( using parametric-methods ) to provide a measure of test-variability . 10.2.8.2.2 compare the pmsd measured in the test with the upper pmsd bound variability-criterion listed in table 6 . when the test pmsd exceeds the upper-bound , the variability among replicates is unusually-large for the test-method . such a test should be considered insufficiently-sensitive to detect toxic-effects on growth or reproduction of substantial-magnitude . a finding of toxicity at a particular-concentration may be regarded as trustworthy , but a finding of `` no toxicity '' or `` no statistically-significant toxicity '' at a particular-concentration should not be regarded as a reliable-indication that there is no substantial toxic-effect on growth or reproduction at that concentration . 10.2.8.2.3 if the pmsd measured for the test is less than or equal to the upper pmsd bound variability-criterion in table 6 , then the test 's variability-measure lies within normal-bounds and the effect-concentration-estimate ( e.g. , noec or loec ) would normally be accepted unless other test-review-steps raise serious-doubts about its validity . 10.2.8.2.4 if the pmsd measured for the test exceeds the upper pmsd bound variability-criterion in table 6 , then one of the following two cases applies ( 10.2.8.2.4.1 , 10.2.8.2.4.2 ) . 10.2.8.2.4.1 if toxicity is found at the permitted receiving-water-concentration ( rwc ) based upon the value of the effect-concentration-estimate ( noec or loec ) , then the test shall be accepted and the effect-concentration-estimate may be reported , unless other test-review-steps raise serious-doubts about its validity . 10.2.8.2.4.2 if toxicity is not found at the permitted rwc based upon the value of the effect-concentration-estimate ( noec or loec ) and the pmsd measured for the test exceeds the upper pmsd bound , then the test shall not be accepted , and a new test must be conducted promptly on a newly collected sample . 10.2.8.2.5 to avoid penalizing-laboratories that achieve unusually high precision , lower pmsd bounds shall also be applied when a hypothesis-test-result ( e.g. , noec or loec ) is reported . lower pmsd bounds , which are based on the 10th-percentiles of national pmsd data , are presented in table 6 . the 10th-percentile pmsd represents a practical-limit to the sensitivity of the test-method because few laboratories are able to achieve such precision on a regular basis and most do not achieve it even occasionally . in determining hypothesis-test results ( e.g. , noec or loec ) , a test concentration shall not be considered toxic ( i.e. , significantly-different from the control ) if the relative-difference from the control is less than the lower pmsd bounds in table 6 . see usepa , 2000b for specific-examples of implementing lower pmsd bounds . 10.2.8.3 to assist in reviewing within-test-variability , epa recommends maintaining-control-charts of pmsds calculated for successive effluent-tests ( usepa , 2000b ) . a control-chart of pmsd values characterizes the range of variability observed within a given laboratory , and allows comparison of individual-test-pmsds with the laboratory 's typical-range of variability . control-charts of other variability and test-performance-measures , such as the msd , standard-deviation or cv of control-responses , or average control-response , also may be useful for reviewing-tests and minimizing-variability . the log of pmsd will provide an approximately normal-variate useful for control-charting . table 6 . variability-criteria ( upper and lower pmsd bounds ) for sublethal-hypothesis-testing endpoints submitted under npdes permits.1 1 lower and upper pmsd bounds were determined from the 10th and 90th-percentile , respectively , of pmsd data from epa 's wet interlaboratory-variability-study ( usepa , 2001a ; usepa , 2001b ) .
