rental-rules scarce in rural iowa by jason clayworthregister staff writer 05/14/2002 thousands of iowans who live in mobile-homes face increasingly unsafe-conditions because no laws exist to govern how landlords care for property outside city-limits , advocates say . none of iowa 's 99 counties regulates upkeep on rental-property in unincorporated-areas , according to county-auditors . that leaves rural-renters in mobile-home-parks , apartments and houses with few places to turn when they encounter problems , said robert simmons of the iowa coalition for housing and the homeless . simmons said he fears a disaster because of bad-wiring or other problems . `` if it 's not installed properly and if it 's not maintained , it could be life-threatening , '' he said . simmons works most directly with residents of the approximately 55,700 mobile-homes in iowa . most either rent the mobile-homes or the lots where the homes are parked . `` there 's nobody telling that landlord to fix the property , '' simmons said . `` more and more we are seeing this as a problem . '' state-law mandates that cities of more than 15,000 residents regulate rental-units . but zoning-ordinances have pushed many mobile-home-parks out of city-limits , where regulations are lacking . `` it 's pretty-amazing how many elected-officials are n't even aware of this issue , '' said terry nelson , vice-president of the manufactured home owners association of america . `` a lot of people rely on their local-government for protection . '' karen fraise , president of the tenant-association at westside trailer park for mobile-homes near fort madison , said the lack of oversight has caused problems for more than 80 families there . `` just because we live in a trailer does n't mean we 're trailer trash , '' fraise said . `` we 're human-beings . '' residents complain that the smell of a nearby-septic-lagoon makes them sick . deep-holes in the road and balky-water-pressure have gone unresolved for several years , she said . mark anderson , an owner of the park , said fraise exaggerates the problems , some of which , he added , have not been brought to his attention . lee county has sewage disposal health rules , which he has not violated , he said . anderson said he complains that some tenants do n't take care of the property even after repairs are made . `` when you have rental-properties , how the tenants take care of the place is what it looks like , '' anderson said . some counties rely on their health-departments to solve rural renter complaints about sewage , roads , and vacant , vermin-infested homes , said william peterson of the iowa association of counties . many types of problems - such as broken-doors or weak-water pressure - are n't considered health-issues , he said . `` i do n't know what people do if they feel they are being unfairly treated , '' he said . `` i do n't know where they would go to file a complaint . '' john bohlen , a resident of the oakwood-heights mobile-home community near ankeny , said not having somewhere to turn when there are problems leaves many mobile-home-dwellers feeling-helpless . for example , oakwood-heights does not have a storm-shelter , he said . `` the tenants feel very frustrated , '' said bohlen , 40 , who owns his mobile-home and pays $ 280 a month to rent the lot . judy johnson , an owner of oakwood-heights , said the park is well-run . if residents are unhappy , they can `` put wheels on their homes and go someplace else , '' she said . `` there 's no shelter , and we 're not going to build a shelter , '' johnson said . `` we do n't have to . we 're not breaking any rules . '' tenants of mobile-home-parks often feel forced to move when conditions become intolerable . iowa has landlord-tenant-laws , but no state or county governing-body regulates them , said robb goedicke , an attorney with legal-aid society of polk county . tenants often must take their problems to court before landlords are forced to make changes , he said . `` the problem is the county does n't have any enforcement-agency , '' goedicke said . `` who does the tenant-turn to ?
