owning a piece of harlem tom perrotta september 26 , 2002 as it waits to learn the fate of its contaminated-office building across from the world-trade center , the legal-aid society has turned its attention to a new home for its harlem neighborhood division . on monday , legal-aid will break ground at the first building it has ever owned , located at the corner of 128th street and madison avenue . legal-aid breaks ground in harlem built of brick and the width of about four brownstones , the fivestory-building is designed to blend in with the architecture of the surrounding-neighborhood . the lot upon which it is being built had been vacant . daniel l. greenberg , president of legal-aid , said the new building has both symbolic and practical-significance . `` harlem was our first permanent-office , '' he said . `` regardless of vagaries in funding , we will remain in harlem . '' legal-aid has about 25-staff-members in its harlem office , currently located on the sixth and seventh-floors of the hotel theresa . it hopes to bring on another 25 or 35 people when the new building opens next-fall . renderings of the new office , provided by the building's architect , the phillips group , bear some resemblance to the agency 's church street building in lower manhattan , which was contaminated with toxins during last year 's world-trade center attacks . along with office-space , the building will include meeting-rooms for community-groups , a playroom for the children of clients , a technology-center , a legal-education-center and a legal library . theresa de leon , legal-aid 's chief-operating-officer , said as the agency searched for new office-space , it learned that buying a building would be less expensive than renting one . she added that the hotel theresa could not support the technology needed to run a modern-law-firm . the building is financed by $ 18 million in tax-exempt-bonds through the industrial development agency , payable over 30 years . legal-aid is also starting what it calls `` campaign for harlem , '' a five-year-fund-raising-effort to increase and improve the services it offers to the harlem community . elaine m. kurtz , legal-aid 's director of development , said the agency would emphasize services for the elderly , housing preservation , employment-advocacy , domestic-violence and support for owners of small businesses . the agency has set a goal of $ 12 million for the first year of its fund-raising-campaign . greenberg said it had already raised $ 7 million , mostly from law-firms on its board and individual benefactors . over the next four years , legal-aid intends to raise an additional $ 10 million .
