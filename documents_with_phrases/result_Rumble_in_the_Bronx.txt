rumble in the bronx over legal-services under orders from washington , legal-services of new york is moving to take more control of its neighborhood-law-offices , but one of those offices , in the bronx , refuses to play along and is taking its main-funder to court to stop it . jill grossman in the bronx , where residents have the least access to legal-representation of any borough , one of the few law-firms that provides free legal-services there is putting its funding on the line . for two years , bronx legal-services has been warned that it would have to consolidate with the rest of the city 's legal-services-system . last monday , the bronx organization filed a lawsuit against its funders , claiming these demands violate both their contract and federal antitrust-laws . bronx legal-services director walker thompson said the increased central-oversight dictated by its funders-compromises his office's independence . but others think the lawsuit is a mistake . `` the position that consolidation means the community will suffer is exactly-wrong , '' said ghita schwarz , president of the legal-services-staff association , the union for legal-service-employees . bronx legal-services is one of seven nonprofit-groups in the city that contract with legal-services of new york ( lsny ) to provide legal-services to the poor . lsny , in turn , reports to its national-parent-corporation and primary-funder , the legal-services corporation ( lsc ) , established by federal-legislation in 1974 . all are chronically under funded : according to the lsc , only 20 percent of the 43 million potential-clients eligible for federally-funded legal-assistance actually get the help . and changes made by congress in 1996 did n't help matters : the legislature cut lsc-funds by 31 percent , to about $ 280 million . that same year , congress also told the lsc to start using competitive-bidding for its contracts . struggling to continue its mission of serving the poor , lsc ordered each of the 14 state legal-service-groups it finances to find new funding-resources and to coordinate services better . new york , like many states , did not embrace the idea at first . but recognizing that its own funding could be jeopardized if it did not follow lsc 's orders , lsny released a plan in october 2000 that consolidates services and centralizes decision-making . while preserving the neighborhood-groups ' own boards of directors , the proposed plan makes them accountable to one central lsny board for decisions like staffing and budgets . to date , six of the seven local-offices have given the plan a preliminary-thumbs-up . but the bronx alone refused , saying that legal-services-lawyers might be forced to answer to lsny 's funders rather than focus exclusively on their clients ' interests . the plan , thompson explained , `` enhances the likelihood of the lawyer having to look over his shoulder . '' legal-services of new york calls that concern -- and the lawsuit itself -- unfounded . `` the new system does raise the accountability level , '' said lsny board member michael w. martin . but he added that lsny is `` committed to the need of the clients and to local input '' -- which is why lsny is maintaining the local-boards . city-limits ( ny ) - monday , august 12 , 2002 more importantly , lsny has to hold onto its federal-funding . because lsc will only fund organizations that cover the entire city , lsny has to cover the bronx . if thompson 's office won't cooperate , said martin , lsny will have to break ties with it and find another local-partner . thompson seems willing to take the risk . in studying his $ 4.6 million budget , about 40 percent of which comes directly from lsny , he determined that bronx legal-services could run on its own in two years -- if he starts fundraising now
