assuring underprivileged a voice jurist-credits-parents for strong-sense of social-responsibility by tina spee wednesday , october 2 , 2002 profile : laurie d. zelon superior court judge los angeles career highlights : appointed by gov . gray davis to los angeles superior court , april 2000 ; partner , morrison & foerster , 1991-2000 ; partner , hufstedler , kaus & ettinger ( and predecessor-firms ) , 1983-91 ; associate , beardsley , hufstedler & kemble ( and related firms ) , 1977-82 law-school : harvard law-school age : 49 los angeles - as an undergraduate at cornell university , laurie d. zelon monitored-campus-demonstrations . a member of the only student-run-chapter of the american civil liberties union in new york state , zelon worked to resolve disputes between students and police officers to help protect the public 's right to peaceful protest . thirty years later , as a los angeles superior court judge , zelon has added the public 's right to a fair-trial to the list of constitutional-rights she works to preserve . a former-president of the los angeles county-bar-association , zelon , 49 , says her 30 years of public-interest-work have allowed her to understand the legal-needs of the underprivileged . she emphasized `` how important it is for them to feel that they 're being listened to , that they have an opportunity to say what they need to say - for them not only to get a fair-trial but to believe that the system is being fair to them . '' the attorneys who appear before zelon attest to the fact that counsel and clients in her courtroom have faith in her objectiveness . `` i ca n't think of a single-client that has n't had a fair-hearing in front of her , '' deputy public-defender noel leon said . `` she's fair to both sides . it sounds crazy , but that 's not always how it is . '' described by the attorneys who appear before her as a consummate professional , zelon-projects quiet-determination , intense intellectual-curiosity , confidence and thoughtfulness , on and off the bench . `` her judicial-temperament is excellent . she never gets ruffled , '' deputy city-attorney andrew wong said . `` i think she is a brilliant jurist . '' zelon has been a longtime-advocate of equal-access to justice for all and an outspoken-proponent of increased , and more stabilized , funding for legal-services-programs . but as a newly assigned judge at the clara shortridge foltz criminal-justice center , zelon 's day-to-day-work no longer affects the public on such a broad-scale . she is an active-member of the court-community-outreach committee , the american bar-association 's ethics 2000 commission and the state-bar of california 's statewide-bench-bar coalition . but her work on the bench affects the lives of the underprivileged , as zelon puts it , `` one by one . '' `` i ca n't be an advocate anymore in the way that i was , but there are lots of opportunities that i have found within the court that are appropriate to the ethical-limits that judges have , '' zelon said . `` i affect people 's lives one person at a time in this job , but sometimes , the effect can be pretty-profound , and sometimes , it's not what you hoped it to be , '' she said . zelon works to ensure that her misdemeanor-court is a relatively welcoming-place for the defendants she comes face to face with on a daily basis . `` i 've talked to so many people over the years , either directly or through the reports from their advocates , about how alien a place the justice-system can be , how unapproachable it can seem to them , '' zelon said . according to the attorneys who appear before her , zelon succeeds in making-everyone in her courtroom at ease . `` she treats everyone , from victims to defendants to attorneys , with the highest respect , '' wong said . `` a lot of my clients really feel that they 're not afraid to come to court because they know she 'll listen to them , and they like her positive-reinforcement , '' leon said . `` she becomes familiar with people who have been in court over and over . she actually cares . '' according to deputy public-defender debbie canada , jurors also are impressed with the respect zelon pays them and the gratefulness with which she thanks them for their time . `` she 's very good with juries , '' canada said . `` she 's very polite , and she makes them feel like their contribution to the system is important . '' zelon acknowledges that she makes an effort to ensure that jurors leave her courtroom with a sense of confidence in the organization of courtroom-proceedings and the effectiveness of the trial-by-jury-system . `` what i try to do , so i can get enough-trial-time and so that the jurors are used in a way that makes sense to them , is start trial by 10:30 in the morning , '' zelon said . `` when people are late , it makes it hard to keep things working in a rational-fashion . '' while unprepared-lawyers annoy her , several-things about the lawyers who appear before her impress zelon . `` one of them is the ability to humanize the case , to take it out of this range of procedures and rules , '' zelon said . `` the second thing is getting in there , digging so hard so that they understand completely and exactly what the facts are . ... those are the ones who really shine . '' zelon said her parents , an accountant and a housewife , gave her a strong-sense of social-responsibility . `` no matter what i ended up doing , i think i would have found some way within that profession to do public-work , because that's what i was taught , '' zelon said . `` it was always a part of me . '' she was born in north carolina and went to high school in westbury , n.y. she received her bachelor 's degree from cornell university in 1974 and then attended harvard law-school . at harvard , zelon made history when her team won the williston competition , a contract-negotiating-contest open to first-year-law students at the school . it was the first time a team with a female member had won the competition . in a class made up of 20-percent-women , zelon held the position of editor in chief of the harvard civil rights-civil liberties law review . she also was a member of the harvard voluntary defenders . `` it was an interesting-time , and there were an awful-lot of changes going on , '' she said . `` people were always-aware of the issue [ of gender ] , but i was never denied an opportunity . '' as a member of the new york civil liberties union , she sat on the board of directors and discussed-issues before the union , such as the proposed nazi march in skokie , ill. , in the late-1970s . shortly after earning her law-degree , zelon joined the american bar-association 's young-lawyers-division , where she served on and chaired several pro-bono and public-service-committees . `` i worked on ... helping to develop standards for pro-bono programs , encouraging-recruitment , getting-law-schools to talk more about pro-bono , [ and ] getting-law-firms more involved in a [ formal ] way , '' she said . she spent 20 years as a litigator , first at hufstedler , kaus & ettinger in los angeles , where she combined her love of science with her passion for litigation as an environmental-law specialist , and then at morrison & foerster , where the firm's large environmental-group and other science-based-divisions gave her room to expand her practice-area . both firms allowed zelon to focus on her private-practice and do community-service . during her career , she accomplished several-things to improve legal-funding for the poor , locally and nationwide . • in the late-1980s , she became-chair of the american bar-association 's standing-committee on lawyers ' public-service responsibility , the group responsible for the association's position on legal-services for the poor . • during her 1995-96 term as president of the los angeles county-bar-association , zelon appeared before congress and successfully argued against its proposed elimination of the public-service corp. , which grants funds to independent local-programs that provide civil legal-assistance to the poor . • after being named chair of the state-bar 's commission on access to justice in 1997 , zelon worked with the state judicial council , the governor 's office and members of the legislature to establish a $ 10-million-a-year legal-access fund for programs that deliver free legal-services . `` the impact of her interest and work on the provision of legal-services in the state of california is immeasurable , '' said patricia phillips , senior-of-counsel for los angeles ' morrison & foerster . `` its value is felt every day by someone who would otherwise be floundering around in the legal-system yet dealing with very serious-problems . '' zelon 's public-interest-work has not gone unnoticed . several-organizations that share her commitment to public-service - including the national legal-aid & defender association and the state-bar of california - have honored her . two years ago , zelon received the laurie d. zelon pro-bono award , which had been named for her one year earlier by the law firm pro-bono project , which she 'd helped found . `` i did n't find out until i was standing in the great-hall of the supreme court , surrounded by 300 people who were there , that the award had been named for me and was thereafter going to be given in my name . it 's very hard to believe , for anyone who knows me well , but i was actually speechless for a period , '' zelon said . zelon faced one of the greatest challenges of her legal-career , she said , when her appointment to the bench forced her to switch gears from civil-litigation to criminal-law . `` it was a steep learning-curve for me , '' she said . `` it 's a whole different-set of processes . the rules are different . the case-law is a whole-body unto itself . '' attorneys praise zelon for her thorough-understanding of the law . `` she 's extremely well-versed in the law , '' leon said . `` she 's very thorough in her research , '' wong said . of course , not all attorneys concur with every decision zelon makes in court . some city-attorneys disagree with her interpretation of evidentiary-statutes when zelon puts limits on their use of hearsay-testimony . but lawyers who have appeared before her say that they appreciate her intelligent-interpretation of the law . `` her rulings always have a firm-foundation behind them no matter which party is adversely affected , '' wong said . zelon and her husband , certified-public accountant david george , have two sons , jeremy and daniel , who are college-students . her outside-interests include skiing , reading and music . zelon considers herself lucky because she loves her position as a judge . `` sometimes , when you want something a lot , there 's this fear in the back of your head that , if you get it , you 're going to be disappointed , '' she said . `` i wanted this a lot , and i have n't been disappointed for a minute . '' but something tells those who know her that zelon wo n't stay put for long before she tackles a greater challenge , and the call that has driven her constantly to give back to the community moves her forward . `` i have a feeling that she 's not going to be a misdemeanor-trial judge for that much longer , '' wong said . `` she 's slated for higher things .
