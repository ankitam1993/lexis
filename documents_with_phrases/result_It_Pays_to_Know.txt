salt lake city tribune seniors find it pays to know rights wednesday , july 24 , 2002 by paul rolly and joann jacobsen-wells when 74-year-old penny sweat was evicted from the hud-subsidized glendale senior housing in salt lake city last month , she moved to a nonsubsidized-apartment at five times her previous-rent because she was unaware of her rights . it turns out the manager of the seniors complex , its attorneys and government-overseers were unaware , too . lee kemp , a hearing-impaired world war ii disabled-vet , also was evicted , but he contacted utah legal-services and was told to stay put . attorney marty blaustein then notified utah nonprofit housing corp. , the building 's owner , that kemp 's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing . that did n't stop utah nonprofit housing 's attorneys from then sending kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out . meanwhile , sweat 's granddaughter called salt lake city-housing officials , federal-housing-officials , state officials and several agents of utah nonprofit housing to find out about her grandmother 's rights . nobody knew . blaustein then took sweat 's case along with kemp 's and demanded her ousting be rectified . utah nonprofit housing president marion willey returned from an out-of-town-trip and learned hud procedures were not followed . the eviction was activated because of ongoing-personality conflicts among seniors in the complex , he said , and the new building-manager decided the problems were with sweat and kemp . several-tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift , however . willey said when his building-manager called attorneys retained by the company , they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants . when she called hud to make sure , the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back . willey says he has offered sweat and kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates . he also is retaining new attorneys .
