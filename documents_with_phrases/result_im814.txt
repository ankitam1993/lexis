preface the federal government depends heavily on a variety of information-technology-products and services to serve the public . each year the government spends billions of dollars on computer-equipment , services , software , and telecommunications . the success or failure of information-system-acquisitions affects executive-agencies ' credibility with the congress and the public as well as their abilities to carry out their missions effectively and efficiently . the general-accounting-office ( gao ) and offices of inspectors-general have consistently identified problems with information-technology-acquisitions . problems identified in numerous evaluations include information-systems that do not meet users' needs , exceed cost-estimates , or take significantly longer than expected to complete . this guide provides a logical-framework for evaluating information-technology-acquisitions . it incorporates a risk-assessment methodology intended to reduce audit-planning-time and ensure that significant-issues are included . it is based on a model of the acquisition-process developed by gao in cooperation with a wide-range of federal and private-sector-officials . 1 the model outlines the process used to acquire information-technologies and identifies elements of the process that are essential for planning and carrying out acquisitions . this guide is intended for use in planning and conducting-risk-assessments of computer-hardware and software , telecommunications , and system-development-acquisitions . a risk-assessment is the process of identifying potential-risks in a system under development and then determining the significance of each risk in terms of its likelihood and impact on the acquisition 's cost , schedule , and ability 1information-technology : a model to help managers decrease-acquisition-risks ( gao/imtec-8.1.6 , august 1990 ) . to meet the agency 's needs . such assessments may have their greatest impact if carried out early , when an agency can more easily alter its acquisition-plans and strategy to manage and control the identified risks . the audit-guide consists of 10 chapters , with appendixes . chapter 1 introduces the purpose of the guide , explains its essential-concepts and techniques , and provides direction in tailoring the guide for use on specific-assignments . chapters 2 through 10 address specific-activities in the acquisition-process . the nine chapters present-audit-guidance on : • management and user-support , • project-staffing , • needs/requirements/ specifications , • alternatives , • acquisition-planning , • solicitation-document , • source-selection , • contract-management , and • test and acceptance . each chapter lists audit-objectives , commonly expected documentation , detailed audit-questions , and references to federal-regulations and guidance . the chapters are intended to assist in the identification of specific-risk-areas and to contribute to an overall-assessment of how well an agency is meeting its acquisition-objectives . this audit-guide is also available in a software-format , accompanied by reference-materials such as the gao model of the acquisition-process , relevant federal-acquisition-regulations , general services administration ( gsa ) guidance , and office of management and budget ( omb ) circulars . the software-version utilizes a hypertext-software-package to help-auditors quickly and flexibly review page 2 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks all the included-documents . this software may be requested from

78 abbreviations chapter 1 introduction this audit-guide is based on and incorporates gao 's information-technology-acquisition model . the model describes three phases in the acquisition-process : presolicitation , solicitation and award , and postaward . it sets out essential-activities in each phase along with critical-factors related to those activities . the model is intended to give managers an overview of the acquisition-process and to help them decrease-acquisition-risks . the model 's critical-factors were drawn from the judgment and expertise of a wide-range of knowledgeable-individuals from government and private-industry . compliance with these critical-factors can increase the likelihood that an acquisition will meet an agency 's needs at a reasonable-cost and in a timely manner . this guide is intended to help-auditors conduct more objectives focused-reviews of information-technology-acquisitions by enabling them to quickly identify significant-areas of risk . using this guide will help-auditors identify critical-factors not addressed by management , make a general-assessment of any procurement-risks , and provide rapid-feedback to agency-officials so they can take corrective-action in a timely and efficient-manner . use of the guide should be selectively tailored to the requirements of particular-reviews and adapted to the status of the acquisition . auditors will need to exercise professional-judgment in assessing the significance of audit-results or findings . for example , the guide assists auditors in determining how an agency identified and defined its requirements . professional-judgment is necessary to evaluate this information and determine if the agency conducted an adequate-requirements-analysis . page 8 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks some areas of assessment will require the expertise of auditors with specific technical-skills and experience . these specific-areas include knowledge of solicitation-procedures , benchmarking and other performance or capability-validation-techniques , and knowledge of technical-areas such as database-management and telecommunications-networks . these areas are identified within the guide . the audit-team should include experienced-members with enough-knowledge of information-technologies to satisfy the government-auditing-standards requirement that auditors have appropriate-skills and knowledge . the audit-approach described in this guide is intended to result in a risk-assessment of an acquisition-project at any point in its development . the auditor will be trying to determine whether a project will result in a specified-product or level of performance and will be delivered at a specified-time and cost . an auditor should use this guide to identify areas that are most likely to result in technical-failures , unmet-user-needs , cost-overruns , or schedule-delays . those risks should then be brought to the attention of appropriate-agency-officials . the audit-steps and questions provided are directed toward assessing whether an agency has sufficiently addressed critical-factors , including-support from managers and users , adequate-project-staff , and controls over the acquisition 's scope before and after a contract is awarded . approach assignment planning when planning a risk-assessment , the auditor should first review the agency 's acquisition-policies and directives to identify the organizations and individuals responsible for approving procurements . approval thresholds , for example , should show which officials have the authority to review and approve acquisitions . page 9 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks organization and use of the audit-guide the agency 's directives should also show the specific-milestones and documentation required for a procurement . the auditor should also review previous-studies or audits of the acquisition-project and of the agency 's information-resources management-functions . reports by gao or other auditing-institutions can provide valuable-background-information . the auditor should also determine whether previous-recommendations have been carried out . the chapters of this audit-guide-focus on logically-distinct steps of the acquisition-process , as described on page 10 of gao's acquisition-model . 1 the following-table identifies the appropriate chapters for reviewing the various-steps of an acquisition . in general , the auditor will want to concentrate on the steps that are relevant to the phase of the acquisition being reviewed . however , regardless of how far the acquisition has advanced , at a minimum the auditor should always ascertain whether senior-managers and users were involved in the project 's initiation . the auditor should also verify that the agency has defined its needs and requirements to support its mission , and that those requirements continue to be valid as the acquisition progresses through contract-award and contract-management . 1gao/imtec-8.1.6 , august 1990 . each of the following-chapters provides references to regulations and other guidance relevant to material in the chapter . in addition , each chapter identifies specific-audit-objectives and documentation expected for the major-activities at that point in the acquisition-process . the documents listed may exist with different-names than those used here . the auditor should refer to agency-specific-requirements for more information . finally , each chapter sets out audit-steps to help plan and conduct the assessment of an acquisition . the questions may need to be tailored to page 11 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks the particular-circumstances of an audit , using the subject agency 's requirements . the appendixes provide further information for use in planning and conducting an acquisition-audit . appendix i contains a worksheet , called an acquisition-profile , to summarize essential-information about the acquisition-project . the worksheet should contain such information as the names and locations of units responsible for the acquisition , the project-purpose , and the expected cost and time-frames . the completed profile should be kept available for later-reference . if a profile exists from an earlier assignment , the auditor should review and update it . appendix ii of this guide describes techniques to use in identifying software-development risks of delays and cost-overruns , known collectively as management-metrics or indicators . these techniques require information about the size of the system being developed and about progress after development has begun . thus , the techniques are only appropriate for use after the agency has completed its design and progressed into developing the system . an auditor using this guide to review an acquisition that includes significant-software-development and has a contract in place should review-appendix ii for techniques to help identify variances from the agency 's cost and schedule-estimates . in some cases , the project-team may be unable to complete a project on time due to an unrealistic-schedule . the cost-models described in appendix ii can be used to make a rough-estimate of how long a system-development may require . such an estimate can be compared to agency-plans to see if the agency has committed itself to unrealistically-short time-frames . in other cases , delays in completing scheduled activities , such as system-design , coding , and testing , can lead to project page 12 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks application of audit-guide to prototyping-methodology slippage later on . auditors will need to tailor the use of the tools described in appendix ii to the circumstances of the audit . appendix iii provides a comprehensive-list of references cited throughout the guide , as well as publications that may be useful for technical-information . finally , a glossary is attached that defines a wide-range of technical and procurement-terminology . this acquisition-guide is intended for use in reviewing any information-technology-acquisition , regardless of the system-development-methodology being used . the guide is structured around the federal-acquisition-process , and is independent of development methods for information-systems . an auditor should recognize that there are different system-development models that may be used when a system-development-effort is acquired . such models may include the `` waterfall '' model , rapid-prototyping , or evolutionary development . some of the documents required under different development-approaches may differ . prototyping , for example , may act as part of the requirements-definition-process , helping the agency identify and control-areas of high uncertainty and technical-risk . in this situation the auditor should ( 1 ) focus on determining how one or more prototypesor incremental-versions function to define the agency 's requirements and ( 2 ) determine how the system-development-methodology used by the agency controls the prototyping-process . one approach to using-prototyping as part of the system-development-process has been described as a `` spiral '' model of system-development . 2 the spiral 2for a description of prototyping and the spiral-model , see roger s. pressman , software-engineering : a practitioner 's approach , 3rd ed . ( new york : mcgraw-hill , inc. , 1992 ) , pp . 26-34 . presenting-conclusions and recommendations model portrays a process in which an agency iteratively ( 1 ) determines its objectives , alternatives , and constraints ; ( 2 ) evaluates its alternatives and identifies and resolves-risk-issues ; ( 3 ) develops and verifies its next-level-products ; and ( 4 ) plans its next-phases . prototypes are developed or modified as part of the second phase . as part of this model , a prototype is developed or revised whenever a risk-analysis shows that significant-areas of uncertainty remain that pose substantial-risks to project-success . when the system has been defined well enough to manage risks effectively , the agency develops and tests a full-scale-system . in order to review an acquisition that is using-prototypes , the auditor should determine what regulations or guidance the agency has to define a prototyping-methodology . this methodology will establish the documentation and approval-points that agency-officials should meet . the auditor can then measure the progress of the prototypes against the agency 's criteria . the auditor should conclude the review by identifying outstanding-areas of risk and the agency 's actions to address those risks . note should be made of how well the agency has addressed the critical-factors in gao 's 1990 model of information-technology-acquisitions as well as agency-compliance with acquisition-regulations , standards , and other federal-guidance . 3 results of the review should be communicated to agency-officials for their comment , in accordance with government-auditing-standards . the auditor should also recommend changes to ensure that the agency is properly addressing the critical-factors in the gao model . for example , the 3gao/imtec-8.1.6 , august 1990. auditor may recommend a greater role for users if they are not involved in approving-alternatives or validating-system requirements . similarly , the auditor should recommend that the agency take appropriate-actions where senior-management-involvement seems lacking , or where the project-organization is unstable and subject to high turnover . the recommendations should be reviewed with agency-officials and be appropriate to the probability and significance of the risks identified . chapter 2 management and user-support this chapter focuses on levels of commitment and support for a planned-acquisition by senior-managers and users , two key-stakeholders in an acquisition . senior-managers include those who have overall-agency-responsibility for strategic , including information-related , objectives . users are those who operate or rely on agency-information-resources and include the managers and staff responsible for agency-policies and programs supported by the acquisition . the involvement and support of senior management throughout an acquisition is essential for success . senior management should envision the agency 's acquisition-goals , define strategic-objectives , and oversee the projects that implement the overall vision . one or more senior-managers should act as system-sponsors , with sufficient-authority to ensure that applicable-resources are available for the project . users should also be involved and provide support throughout the acquisition to ensure that their requirements are understood and that the resulting-system is both accepted and used . user-involvement should be sustained from the needs-determination-phase through final-acceptance and implementation . user-involvement in the acquisition-process will help avoid the development of products that ultimately do not meet agency-requirements . the audit-steps in this section should be used to assess the potential-risks posed by the lack of management or user-support . an acquisition that lacks either or both of these elements is at risk of incurring unnecessary-cost-overruns , not meeting its planned delivery-schedule , and not satisfying-agency-needs . audit-objectives 1 . to ensure that senior-managers-support and areactively involved throughout the development and implementation of an acquisition . 2 . to ensure that users support the acquisition byactively participating in defining-procurement-requirements , developing the solicitation-document , and verifying that the equipment and/or services contracted for meet the agency 's needs . • decision papers , memoranda , or other records of documentation senior-management-oversight and approval ofrequired-acquisition objectives and plans . • program-management directives or other written directives from senior-managers stating-goals and objectives of the acquisition and delegating-authority to carry out the acquisition . • budget-exhibits and plans showing that sufficient-funding is committed to the acquisition . • project plans showing the role of users in planning and overseeing the acquisition . any documentation of the users ' role in validating-acquisition-requirements , alternatives , and the solicitation-document . users ' roles and responsibilities may be detailed in a memorandum of understanding between user-organizations and the program-office . • agency-policies or guidelines on the structure of steering-committees or other oversight-bodies , with responsibilities of project-members and senior-managers delineated . audit-steps : top-management-support 1 . identify senior-management-officials responsiblefor the acquisition . include senior-program-officials heading the user-organizations , information-resource-management officials , and members of senior-oversight or steering-committees . determine the roles page 17

requirements / specifications the purpose of this chapter is to guide the auditor in determining whether the agency has developed an accurate-description of its information-technology-needs . the acquisition should be clearly linked to program-needs , to the agency 's overall strategies , and to governmentwide policies and standards . the agency should expand on its basic-description of needs to define specific-requirements so providers of information technology can respond with meaningful-solutions . in some cases , an agency may use prototypes to help define or validate its requirements . the requirements then form the basis for even more detailed specifications . in identifying its requirements , an agency should plan for testing the information-resources it needs . these plans should cover acceptance , security , and certification-requirements . the test-plans developed at this point form the basis for later evaluations of contract-performance . failure to clearly and accurately define information technology-requirements poses high risks for any agency . for instance , improperly defined-requirements may preclude alternatives , restrict competition , increase the risk of cost and schedule-overruns , and lead to systems that are inconsistent with an agency 's overall architecture and incompatible with other agency-systems . the hardware or software purchased may also be inconsistent with government-standards . designing and implementing a system is also more difficult if input , output , and processing-specifications are incomplete or inaccurate . in addition , if security and internal-control-requirements are not well defined , control over sensitive information or other assets may be lost . page 25 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks chapter 4 needs / requirements / specifications audit-objectives 1 . to ensure that the acquisition is based on clearlyunderstood-needs or opportunities and that it is consistent with the overall-strategy and architectures used by the agency . 2 . to ensure that the agency defines its requirements , based on the needs identified earlier and validated by functional-users , well enough to support the acquisition of hardware , software , telecommunications , and system-development-services . these requirements should primarily be expressed in functional-terms in accordance with firmr policy . 3 . to ensure that system-specifications clearly andaccurately summarize the agency 's requirements . documentation • needs-statement . required • requirements-analysis or functional-requirements document . • system-specifications , if prepared . also , draft-specifications with industry-comments if draft-specifications were released . • test-plan and requirements

acquisition-planning is to promote and provide for full and open-competition . to ensure that the planning is accomplished in an effective , economical , and timely manner , the agency should prepare an acquisition-plan containing an overall-strategy for managing the preaward , acquisition , and postaward phases . an effective-acquisition-plan is critical to project-success . the plan sets out what the agency will do to complete a procurement and how it will do it . the plan also specifies the type of contract that will be awarded , how the agency will select a contractor , cost and schedule goals , milestones , significant-risk-areas , and contract-management-controls . auditors should assess the extent to which the agency's acquisition-planning is realistic and comprehensive . one part of this assessment should be the review of the agency-procurement-request ( apr ) to ascertain whether it is complete and accurately reflects the objectives and scope of the project . to verify that the agency has defined an effectiveaudit objective-strategy and plan for selecting a contractor and managing contract-performance . • acquisition-plan and related-documents as documentation appropriate , such as a plan of action and milestones.required • agency-procurement-request and other correspondence with gsa . 1 . determine whether the acquisition-plan was audit-steps reviewed and approved in a timely manner by the officials designated in the agency 's acquisition-regulations . ensure that the program-manager periodically reviews the acquisition-plan and updates it when necessary . 2. review the acquisition-plan and determine if itcontains the elements required by the far section 7.1 and gao 's information technology : a model to help managers decrease-acquisition-risks . these elements include acquisition-objectives ; cost goals ; responsible decision-makers ; capability or performance-characteristics ; risks associated with technical-matters , scheduling , and costs ; plan of action ; competition ; source-selection-procedures ; contract-type and special-contract-provisions ; contract-management-procedures or organization ; budget and funding ; information needed to monitor contractor-performance ; test and evaluation ; security and privacy ; and acquisition-milestones . the plan should also identify the acquisition-method , key `` go/no-go '' points , a formal-training-plan , and a contingency-plan to minimize losses . 3 . determine if the acquisition-plan calls for full-andopen competition . if the plan calls for limiting the acquisition to resources compatible with existing-equipment , verify that conversion-cost-studies have been completed to justify compatibility-restrictions . if the plan calls for other than full and open-competition , verify that restrictions on competition , such as make and model-restrictions or sole-source-requirements , have been justified and approved by the designated authority . ( see ch . 4 step 6 , under requirements and step 3 , under specifications . ) 4 . determine whether the agency has planned a '' grand-design '' project or organized the acquisition page 41 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks into modules . incremental-purchasing may limit risks by identifying-problems earlier , which allows for easier change or correction . 5 . evaluate the project-management-tools andtechniques to satisfy management-information-requirements for monitoring contractor-performance , tracking-progress against the acquisition-plan , and taking-action on cost or schedule-slippage . 6. review the agency 's schedule for developing thesolicitation-document and for source-selection-activities . assess the reasonableness of the schedule through discussions with procurement-officials and reviews of project-progress . 7 . identify the dollar-limit of the agency's generaldelegation of procurement-authority from gsa . confirm that the agency receives a specific-delegation of authority from gsa if the value of the acquisition exceeds the agency 's authority-level . confirm that the new delegation of procurement-authority was received before a solicitation-document is issued or a contract awarded . 8. review the apr if the acquisition exceeds theagency's delegated procurement-authority level . determine if the apr identifies the officials responsible for managing the effort , in accordance with the gsa guidance provided in firmr bulletin c-5 . the apr should include : a . names and titles of senior-project-officials , with adescription of their roles in the organization . if the acquisition exceeds $ 25 million , the apr should also describe the project-manager 's experience in previous-acquisitions , responsibilities , and scope of authority , and the reporting-structure for each official as well as whether each official is assigned full- or part-time to the acquisition . b . the project-title and a brief-description of the acquisition . c. information-resources currently in use . d. resources to be acquired . e. the contracting-approach . the approach shouldinclude any limitations on competition , the planned-dates for release of the solicitation and for contract-award , and a strategy for a follow-on implementation if a prototype is to be used . f. estimated-contract-life and contract-cost . g. completion-dates for key-project-documents . • far-part 7 : acquisition-planning . references • far-part 34 : major-system acquisition . • gsa , overview guide , p. 4-3 . • omb circular a-109 : major-system acquisitions .

for a specific-acquisition . page 43 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks chapter 7 solicitation-document a solicitation-document provides information necessary for vendors to propose equipment , software , and services to meet the agency 's requirements . in most cases , information-resources will be purchased by issuing an rfp , which forms the basis for the resulting-contract . less commonly , an agency may acquire information-resources using an invitation for bids . an rfp may be preceded by a request for information or request for quotation . an rfp should be clear and comprehensive and include the elements described in gsa 's guidance on standard-solicitation documents . 1 the areas of most interest to auditors include section c : description/specifications/work statement , section e : inspection and acceptance , and section m : evaluation-factors for award . section c describes the tasks to be performed by the contractor and the products to be delivered . section e sets out government and contractor-responsibilities in ensuring that contract-deliverables are acceptable to the agency . section m explains how the agency intends to select a winning-contractor by describing the importance of all factors to be considered in evaluating-proposals . in developing the rfp an agency may hold presolicitation or preproposal-conferences in order to seek industry-views on the planned-acquisition and to encourage companies to offer proposals . once the rfp is developed , it may be released in draft-form in order to obtain industry-questions and reactions . auditors should determine what steps the agency has taken to get feedback on its requirements , how the agency has handled comments or questions on a proposed rfp , and whether the agency has acted to ensure that contractor-proposals are competitive . 1see , for example , u.s. general services administration , information-resources management service , overview guide : acquisition of information-resources , ( jan. 1990 ) . a proper rfp is a critical-element of a successful-acquisition because it becomes part of the binding-contract once a proposal is made and accepted . if the rfp does not accurately and clearly describe the agency 's requirements , or if the evaluation-factors do not accurately reflect the agency 's priorities , then the resulting acquisition may not meet user-needs . if the rfp is unjustifiably restrictive , favoring one contractor over others , the agency may be unable to benefit from full and open-competition . auditors should become familiar with the standard-format for an rfp . the audit-team should include persons sufficiently knowledgeable about the information technology being purchased to judge how well the agency has defined its requirements in the rfp . team-members should include or have access to people who can identify areas where the rfp does not define the agency 's needs well enough to protect the government 's interests . these persons should also know enough about performance or capability-validation-techniques to determine whether or not the agency 's requirements are reasonable and effective . audit-objectives to determine whether or not the solicitation-document is complete , clear , and consistent , verify that requirements continue to reflect user-needs , and determine if the proposed evaluation-process will result in an effective and economical-acquisition . documentation required • record of presolicitation or preproposal conference . • solicitation-document : rfp or invitation for bid . draft rfps and requests for information , if any were issued . • report of a solicitation-review-panel or committee if appropriate . • source-selection-plan . • benchmark-materials or other capability and performance-validation requirements . • vendor-comments or questions on solicitation-document . if a vendor protests the solicitation determine the basis-of-the protest and how it was resolved . • proposal-evaluation-guide . audit-steps 1 . determine whether the solicitation-document contains : a . a statement of work or specifications statementthat clearly and accurately describes the government 's requirements , including a clear-definition of all deliverables and the conditions of their acceptability . b . a clear-definition of government and contractor-responsibilities . c. the relative-importance of evaluation-factors . d. a proposal-format requiring that cost and technicalelements be separated . e. reasonable-provisions that protect the agency ( such as liquidated-damages-provisions ) or give incentives to the contractor ( such as bonuses for good-performance ) . identify option-clauses that create uncertainty in work-load-projections . 2 . examine the evaluation-criteria to ensure : a . they are consistent with the requirements-analysis , specifications , and proposal-preparation instructions . b . they provide all the factors and significantsubfactors to be considered in evaluating-offers and the relative-importance of different technical or cost-factors , in accordance with far 15.605 . 3 . evaluate the performance evaluation package theagency will use . determine whether the agency reimburses contractors for participating in benchmarking or other testing , and whether the cost of such performance-evaluation-efforts constitutes a barrier to competition . a . if there is a benchmark , has the benchmark been independently examined by some outside-organization ? review the benchmark-plan to confirm that demonstration-criteria are clearly stated . determine how the agency selected a representative-mix of programs for the benchmark . determine if the complexity of programs in the benchmark is representative of the projected work-load . determine how the agency validated the benchmark as representative of the agency 's work-load . b . if there is simulation or modeling , determine how the agency selected-parameters for the model . review any concerns or complaints raised by vendors . c. if a compute-off ( demonstration of prototypes ) is to be used , confirm that the agency has established plans for prototype and follow-on-contracts . 4 . interview-users and managers , if necessary , todetermine whether they concur with the solicitation . determine whether users or managers identify new or changed-requirements not included in the rfp . find out if there are any factors considered important for selecting an offer that are not included in the page 47 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks evaluation-criteria or if other included factors unfairly restrict the competition . ( for related-information see ch . 2 , step 2g , under user-involvement . ) 5. review the agency 's source-selection-plan to ensurethat it clearly describes the source-selection-organization and activities . ensure that the source-selection-plan has been approved by the source-selection-authority before presolicitation conferences are held or the solicitation-document is issued , in accordance with far 15.612 . 6. review the industry feedback process anddetermine if : a . comments received on the draft-solicitationidentify any need for clarification , restrictive-specifications , or alternative-ways of satisfying-user-needs . ( see ch . 4 , step 5 under specifications , for a related-question . ) b . the agency responded promptly and thoroughly-tothe comments received . ( judgmental-sampling-techniques may be required in this section if the number of vendors and vendor-comments are substantial . ) c. the feedback provided adequate-comments-onproduct availability in the market . d. the use of an ombudsman facilitated the process of addressing-vendor-concerns , disputes , and grievances . 7 . determine who has performed legal-reviews of thesolicitation-document . 8 . determine if any vendor submitted a protest , towhom ( the agency , gao , or gsa 's board of contract page 48 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks appeals ) , and how it was resolved . determine the basis-of-the protest and its resolution . • gsa , overview guide , chapter 6 . references • far , part 15 : contracting by negotiation , subpart 15.4 : solicitation and receipt of proposals-andquotations ; subpart 15.612 : formal-source-selection ; subpart 15.605 : evaluation-factors . • far-part 14 : sealed-bidding . • far-part 5 : publicizing-contract-actions . • far-part 34 : major-system acquisition . • gao , information technology : a model to help managers decrease-acquisition-risks ( gao/imtec-8.1.6 , august 1990 ) , phase ii , steps 2 through 7 . • fips publications 75 and 42-1 . chapter 8 source-selection the source-selection-process is critical to securing the best value for the government . all proposals must be evaluated in accordance with the criteria published in the rfp . if the evaluation-process does not conform to the rfp the agency runs a greater risk of a successful-bid-protest by losing-vendors . the agency should receive proposals , evaluate the technical and cost merits of different-proposals , negotiate with contractors , and award a contract in accordance with a source-selection-plan developed before release of the rfp . the auditor should be aware of the agency 's organization and procedures for making a contract-award . agencies may use some or all of the following-positions : • contracting-officer ( co ) . the contracting-officer publicizes the procurement , amends the rfp if necessary , and conducts all negotiations with offerors . • source-selection-authority ( ssa ) . the ssa makes the final decision on contract-award . the contracting-officer may be the ssa for some procurements , while in other cases a more senior-manager may serve as ssa . • source-selection advisory council ( ssac ) . the ssac reviews the evaluations of different-proposals and makes a recommendation to the ssa on contract-award . • source-selection evaluation board ( sseb ) . the sseb conducts technical and cost-evaluations of vendor proposals . to ensure that the source-selection-process isaudit-objective planned and carried out in order to successfully reach a contract that gives the best value to the government . page 50 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks • source-selection-plan , including-source-selection documentation organization . required • lessons learned-report or other report by the contracting-officer describing-negotiations and selection activities . • contracting-officer 's contract-file . • records of debriefings , if any . • results of benchmarks or other performance and capability-validation-techniques used . • correspondence between offerors and the agency regarding questions or clarifications and any amendments to the rfp . • proposal-evaluation-guide . • preaward-survey-reports . audit-steps 1 . examine the evaluation-process by reviewingrecords of the source-selection-procedures and determine : a . if evaluation-personnel strictly adhered to andapplied the publicized evaluation-process and criteria in the solicitation . b . if evaluation-factors were applied that were notlisted in the solicitation . c. whether cost and technical-evaluations were done separately . d. the role-users played in the evaluation-process .

whether to accept contract-deliverables . for testing to be effective , it must be addressed relatively-early in the acquisition so it can be properly included in planning . test-plans provide testing-procedures and the evaluation-criteria to assess results of the testing . an agency should establish its initial-test-plans in the presolicitation-phase . these plans should show how the agency will verify that the acquired equipment , software , or services meet user-needs and satisfy security-requirements . after a contract is awarded the agency will need to carry out test and acceptance procedures . the auditor should ensure that test-planning is conducted early enough so that test-requirements are included in the contract . in assessing the postaward-phase , the auditor should ensure that the agency has not accepted equipment or software that does not meet its requirements . the contract should specify conditions for acceptable-performance . for example , the contract may require that a computer operate successfully for 30 consecutive-days out of a 90-day test-period . agency-personnel should ensure that the contractor fully meets the conditions for acceptable-performance . internal-auditors may be required to verify that the equipment or software pass the specified-tests . assessing the test and acceptance-phase may require a high level of technical-skill on the part of auditors , such as when an agency has contracted for software-development-services and must test the quality of delivered software . the auditor should be able to understand the system-requirements , development-methodologies , and test-tools being used . page 60 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks to confirm that the agency has : audit-objectives 1 .

( explain any variances and their effects . ) appendix ii management-metrics purpose this appendix describes tools and techniques for measuring the status of acquisitions involving significant-software-development . it describes techniques , known as software-metrics , for quantitatively measuring how closely a project conforms to development-plans and assessing whether an acquisition is at risk of delay or cost-increases . these techniques require considerable information about the system being developed and can only be used after system-design . the metrics described here will generally be used after contract-award , in order to assess how well the agency is managing the system-development-process . software-metrics , which use mathematical-models to measure elements of the development-process , are intended to help organizations better understand and manage the relationships between resource-decisions , development-schedules , and the cost of software-projects . by using-software metric-tools an auditor can independently evaluate software-development-projects by analyzing project-budgets , requirements , schedules , and resources , and then confirm or question-cost , schedule , and resource-estimates . different-metrics may be useful for an audit , depending on the objectives and status of an acquisition . using-cost-models to estimate the cost and length of time necessary to develop a new software-system , for example , is appropriate only after requirements have been defined , a system-design has been developed , and the size of the new system has been estimated . the models described here require estimates of either the lines of code or number of function-points that the new system will include . cost-models project the time and cost to develop a system on the basis of estimates of the system 's size and other pertinent-factors . they may be used before a solicitation for software-development is page 68 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks issued in order to assess the reasonableness of the agency's schedule ( if a system-design has been prepared ) , or after a contract has been awarded and software-development has begun . the other metrics described in this appendix require that system-development work be underway . a comparison of the actual-number of functions successfully tested to the number planned in the acquisition-schedule , for example , requires that system testing be underway . cost-models cost-models are tools that estimate the effort needed to develop software , based on assumed relationships between the size of a system and the effort needed to design , code , and test the software . these models can help the auditor assess whether the acquisition 's estimated-cost and schedule are reasonable . each model-uses cost-drivers , which are parameters such as the level of experience of the programmers , the reliability-requirements of the programs , and the complexity of the project , along with the estimated-project-size , to derive overall-cost and schedule-estimates for the acquisition . when a system involving-software is being developed , one or more cost-models may be useful . a model will be more reliable if it takes into account the agency's historical-experience in developing-systems . cost-models are available both commercially and from a few agencies within the department of defense . most of the tools were developed initially for use with defense department-projects , but can also be used with non-defense-systems . many are based on industry-recognized-models such as the constructive-cost model ( cocomo ) , price , putnam , and jensen . the commercial-tools range in cost from about $ 500 to well over $ 20,000 . government-developed or government-modified-tools are available free of page 69 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks charge with a nominal-charge for upgraded copies of the software . because many different-packages are available , and because more than one can be used , auditors should determine what models , if any , are used in their agencies . typically cost-models are derived using-data gathered from years of experience with a wide-range of software-projects . therefore , accuracy of predictions may improve as further experience is accumulated in an agency . auditors should use cost-models to look for discrepancies with the cost and schedule-estimates established for an acquisition . by varying the estimated-values for cost-drivers , the auditor may also be able to perform a sensitivity-analysis illustrating where project-estimates are most susceptible to change . however , cost-models have significant-limitations in accuracy unless their underlying-assumptions of system-size and cost-drivers are carefully chosen and reflect the agency 's previous-experience in system-development . it is a matter of auditor-judgment to decide how discrepant-project-estimates and estimates provided by cost-models should be to raise concerns about risks of cost and schedule-overruns . in making this judgment , the auditor should take into account the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions made in using a cost-model . auditors should use a cost-model to provide general-estimates and not precise-figures . therefore , in applying-software-metrics to audit-work , care must be taken to follow generally accepted-government-auditing standards when drawing-conclusions based on the results of software-metrics . specifically , all findings should be qualified by the recognition that these tools are limited by the accuracy of the page 70 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks estimated-system-size and other project-data provided for the model , the historical-data from which the model was developed , and the fact that all estimates are projections of an inherently-uncertain future . procedures for minimizing the effect of these limitations require , for example , proper technical-advice , qualifying-language in audit-reports , and a review of data and assumptions by agency-officials . auditors should also ensure that the model used is consistent with the software-development-methodology of the project under consideration . a system developed through rapid-prototyping , for example , should be evaluated with a model that takes prototyping into account . the following-indicators are intended to help-auditors other indicators assess how effectively an agency is managing a system-development contract . these indicators measure differences between what an agency planned for its contractor to accomplish by certain points in the systems development life-cycle and the actual results . in most cases this comparison is most easily done graphically . using more than one indicator can give a broader picture of a project 's status . auditors should use indicators appropriate to the project under review and for which data are available . problem-reports this indicator involves tracking the number of open and closed-problems reported by a contractor as a system is developed . a problem could be any anomaly discovered during design , coding , testing , or implementation . problems are distinguished from failures of code , which represent defects discovered during operation . contracts should specify how problems are to be identified and reported . by reviewing these reports and noting how quickly page 71 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks problems are resolved , auditors can obtain an understanding of how well the contractor is performing . the project-manager or contracting-officer 's technical representative may be the best source for problem-reports . because an agency may choose to prioritize problems in order of their impact , the reports should distinguish between priority-levels of problems . figure ii.1 shows one way to present this kind of analysis . it shows the number of new problems reported and the number of problems closed in order to show a trend over time and to show any backlog that may be developing . the auditor may also choose to report total-problems reported and resolved or break them out by level of priority . figure ii.2 shows the length of time that problems have remained open in order to demonstrate how quickly software-problems are resolved once found . in this example , three levels of priority are distinguished for reported problems . figure ii.1 : problem-reports in software project figure ii.2 : problems by priority-levels and number of months unresolved software volatility software volatility is also measured graphically . figure ii.3 shows changes in the total number of approved system-requirements . cumulative-changes are also tracked , including-additions , deletions , and modifications to requirements . steady-increases in the number of requirements and changes to requirements may indicate that the project is at risk for delays and cost-overruns . figure ii.3 : software requirements-changes development progress this indicator involves the comparison of actual and expected progress in the design , coding , and integrating of system-units . units can be measured in terms of computer-software-units or computer-software configuration-items . if the project-team does not complete its design or programming and testing-activities as planned , this indicator can show schedule-delays before major milestones are reached . the progress-indicator can show all elements of design , coding , testing , and integrating , or it may treat them as separate-indicators . figure ii.4 shows how page 75 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks planned and actual-progress in the design and coding of software units can be displayed . figure ii.4 : development progress software-size this indicator-records changes in the expected magnitude of the software-development-effort . the size of the system , measured in source-lines of code as established by the system-design , may change as the system is coded . changes in size can be expressed page 76 gao/imtec-8.1.4 assessing-acquisition-risks as total-lines of code or can be broken out into new , modified , and reused-lines of code . changes in the estimated-system-size may indicate that the project was overestimated or underestimated in size and complexity . these changes may also indicate that requirements are changing and may be related to the software volatility-issue described earlier . increasing-estimates of software-size should alert the auditor that the project 's schedule and expected cost may be underestimated . changes in the expected system-size may necessitate reestimates of the development-cost , using the cost-models described earlier in this appendix . figure ii.5 shows how the estimates of software-size can be tracked over time . figure ii.5 : software-size estimates personnel stability tracking the total number of people assigned to a system-development-effort compared to planned staffing-levels provides another indicator of potential-problems . the auditor can examine projected versus actual-levels of total-personnel or of key , experienced-personnel . understaffing may result in schedule-slippage . adding-personnel late in a project can actually-cause further slippage . other metrics may be chosen as needed . auditors could , for example , compare expected to actual-usages of hardware-resources in order to identify emerging computer capacity problems . another approach would involve tracking-changes to the estimated-completion date for a system . the metrics described here offer suggestions to be tailored for use as appropriate to particular-projects . appendix iii reference-materials federal-regulations each chapter of this guide lists applicable-reference-materials including federal-regulations and guidance published by gsa , omb , and other agencies . when using these references , summarized below , auditors should ensure that the most current-version available is used . applicable-regulations
