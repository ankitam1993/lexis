helping-hands funds to help battered-women with divorce , child-custody-cases liz stevens sunday , october 27 , 2002 legal-assistance for battered-women is hard to come by . but it just got a little easier to find in tarrant county . this month , the federal-violence against women office awarded a two-year , $ 350,000 grant to the women 's haven of tarrant county . the money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time-attorney to its staff and contract with the law-school-clinic at texas wesleyan university for pro-bono and student-services . most important , the funds will help fill a frustrating-gap . the women 's haven , which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence-victims , already has a full-time-attorney . but that person is prohibited ( by funding-parameters ) from representing women in matters of divorce or child-custody . that 's not a problem for most of the shelter 's indigent-residents , who can access free legal-aid locally from west texas legal-services . but many of the clients served by the women 's haven outreach-programs are the working poor , who do n't qualify for free legal-services . divorces and custody-battles are simply out of their financial-reach . `` they ca n't begin to save up enough-money for a divorce , so they 're stuck , '' says sonyia hartwell , the women 's haven 's associate director . `` they 're completely shut out of the civil-law system . '' in texas , unlike in some other states , women who are n't divorced ca n't gain full-control over their portion of assets . and they ca n't obtain child-support . the grant will also provide law-students with valuable-experience working these types of cases . `` they ca n't go to court , but they can interview clients and do all the initial-intake-work that needs to be done '' as well as investigative-work , says hartwell . and there 's no shortage of abuse-victims who need this kind of help . `` within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle , '' says hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney , `` we 'll have an active caseload of 20 or more .
