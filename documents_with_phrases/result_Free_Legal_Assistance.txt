los angeles times tuesday , june 18 , 2002 free legal-assistance as close as a keyboard state experimenting with video-kiosks to help litigants file forms and get basic-advice . monte morin times staff writer when single-father thurman williams needed-help filling out papers in a custody-suit recently , he did n't look to his lawyer for help . he walked to a computerized-kiosk at the lamoreaux justice-center in orange and started tapping the keys . as part of a legal-experiment , litigants without lawyers across california are using computerized-video-kiosks to prepare common court-filings and seek basic legal-advice . the kiosk used by williams is part of a statewide-effort to cope with a flood of litigants who can not afford or refuse to hire lawyers . court-officials statewide fear the number of self-represented-litigants has reached crisis-levels and threatens to clog court-calendars . like williams , more than 6,000 orange county litigants have initiated court-actions on i-can ! kiosks or accessed the programs on the internet , using-home-computers . similar-programs are operating in sacramento , san diego and ventura . a recent-study of the kiosks ' first 18 months of operation concluded it is too soon to tell if the system will relieve pressure on court-calendars . but the report , by uc irvine 's school of social ecology , said users were overwhelmingly-positive about the free legal-assistance . `` it 's made life a lot easier for me , '' williams said . `` it's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse . '' the 29-year-old orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the lamoreaux justice-center by court-staff . after putting on headphones and following the directions of a videotaped-instructor , williams filled out a quarter-inch-stack of paternity and custody documents . the exercise took 20 minutes ; it would have cost him about $ 800 if he had relied on a lawyer , he said . `` it was a lot easier than i thought . '' whether they ca n't afford a lawyer or just want to save money , more californians are going to court without a lawyer . `` i 'm just amazed at the numbers , '' said commissioner salvador sarmiento , who hears between 40 and 90-child-support-cases a day in lamoreaux justice-center . `` eighty percent of the cases i hear involve people representing themselves . these cases can take 50 % longer to process than others . '' sarmiento said the kiosks have put many cases on the fast-track . `` most people who appear before me without attorneys are real nervous , '' sarmiento said . `` they do n't know what to expect and they want to tell me everything . it 's an opportunity for them to vent . a lot of what they say is irrelevant . when they go to the kiosks though , i get the information that i need so i can rule . '' of the 4.3 million-state-residents who find themselves in court each year , more than half are pro per , or self-represented-litigants . the phenomenon is particularly-evident in family-courts , where fewer than 16 % of all child- support-cases involve parents who are both represented by lawyers . also , 80 % of all domestic-violence-cases are handled without lawyers . the state-bar of california has characterized the trend as `` the pro per crisis in family-law '' and the state judicial council has established a task-force on the matter . the legislature has attempted to address the problem by establishing family- law-facilitator-offices throughout the state to help litigants in child-support-matters . in courts such as orange county 's , the offices have offered workshops for litigants . classes often have two-month waiting-lists . in van nuys , officials last year established the self-help legal access center , in which people can seek legal-help from computers and volunteers . i-can ! kiosks are in eight locations , including the orange county district-attorney 's office , irvine city hall and the fullerton and san juan capistrano-libraries . however , the busiest location is in the lamoreaux justice-center . at the family-law information-center , where open-boxes of tissues are displayed as prominently as forms for initiating divorce , custody and child- support-proceedings , office-assistant beatrice contreras said there is often a line of people waiting to use the two machines . employing interactive video- and touch-screen-technology , the kiosks guide users through the bureaucracy of obtaining domestic-violence-restraining-orders , establishing-child-custody , responding to child-support and eviction-orders , initiating small-claims-suits and requesting-waivers for legal-filing fees . the kiosks give instructions in english , spanish and vietnamese and offer users video-tours of court-complexes and primers on what to expect during court-hearings . `` people like it because they say it 's fast and easy and especially because they do n't have to pay for an attorney . they really like that , '' contreras said . there still are some bugs in the system . among users' complaints : the small , immobile-keyboards are sometimes-difficult to use , and the touch-screens have to be tapped in just the right way . `` mostly it 's good-comments though , '' contreras said . `` people will come in here very confused and very sad and not know what to do . once they work with the computer and finish , you can tell they're not as sad . they 're glad that they 're getting some help .
