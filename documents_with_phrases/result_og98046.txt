office of the general counsel b-279823 april 29 , 1998 the honorable john h. chafee chairman the honorable max baucus ranking minority member committee on environment and public works united states senate the honorable thomas j. bliley , jr. chairman the honorable john d. dingell ranking minority member committee on commerce house of representatives subject : environmental-protection agency : emission-standards for locomotives and locomotive-engines pursuant to section 801 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of title 5 , united states code , this is our report on a major-rule promulgated by the environmental-protection agency ( epa ) , entitled `` emission-standards for locomotives and locomotive-engines '' ( rin : 2060-ad33 ) . we received the rule on march 26 , 1998 . it was published in the federal register as a final-rule on april 16 , 1998 . 63 fed . reg . 18978 . the final-rule contains emission-standards and associated regulatory-requirements for the control of emissions from locomotives and locomotive-engines as required by section 213 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the clean-air act . the standards will take effect in the year 2000 and will ultimately result , according to epa , in a more than 60-percent reduction in oxides of nitrogen from locomotives . enclosed is our assessment of the epa 's compliance with the procedural-steps required by section 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) through ( iv ) of title 5 with respect to the rule . our review indicates that the epa complied with the applicable-requirements . gao/ogc-98-46 if you have any questions about this report , please contact james vickers , assistant general counsel , at ( 202 ) 512-8210 . the official responsible for gao evaluation-work relating to the environmental-protection agency is peter guerrero , director , environmental-protection issues . mr. guerrero can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-6111 . robert p. murphy general counsel enclosure cc : mr. thomas e. kelly director , office of regulatory management and information environmental-protection agency page 2 gao/ogc-98-46 enclosure analysis under 5 u.s.c . § 801 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i ) - ( iv ) of a major-rule issued by the environmental-protection agency entitled `` emission-standards for locomotives and locomotive-engines '' ( rin : 2060-ad33 ) ( i ) cost-benefit-analysis epa performed a cost-benefit-analysis which is summarized in the preamble to the final-rule . our office received a copy of the full analysis . over the 41-year life of the program , the time necessary to ensure a complete-fleet-turnover , epa estimates that the total-costs will be $ 3.273 billion or $ 1.331 billion at net-present value . this will result in a total-benefit in the reduction of oxides of nitrogen of over 20 million tons and reductions of 275,000 metric-tons of particulate-matter and 400,000 metric-tons of hydrocarbons . an analysis for oxides of nitrogen reveals a cost-effectiveness of $ 163 per ton or $ 66 per ton at net-present value . ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 , and 609 the administrator of the epa has certified that the final-rule will not have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities . epa has identified two types of small-entities which could potentially be impacted by the rule : ( 1 ) small businesses involved in locomotive aftermarket-parts-production and locomotive remanufacturing and ( 2 ) small-railroads . epa has determined that the impacts would be minimal or nonexistent because , among other reasons , the phase-in of the remanufacturing-requirements combined with the compliance-flexibility given to small businesses during the initial-years of the program will allow them to make the transition into the new marketplace for certified-remanufactures without hardship . also , small-railroads are exempt from the tier 0 remanufacturing-requirements for their existing-fleets and the railroad inuse test program included in the rule only applies to class i freight-railroads , thus exempting all small-railroads from the requirement . epa states that it tailored the rule to minimize or eliminate the effects on small-entities . gao/ogc-98-46 ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 according to epa , the final-rule does not impose an intergovernmental-mandate of $ 100 million or more in any one year because the rule does not impose an enforceable-duty on any state , local , or tribal-government . however , the final-rule does impose a mandate that may result in the expenditure of $ 100 million or more in any one year on the private sector . epa utilized the cost and benefit-analysis it performed pursuant to executive-order no . 12866 and the discussion of alternatives it considered to satisfy the requirements of the unfunded-mandates reform act , as permitted by section 202 ( c ) of the act . epa also states that the analysis shows that it chose the alternative which represented the least costly , most cost-effective-approach to achieving the air-quality-goals of the clean-air act . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the final-rule was issued using the notice and comment procedures in 5 u.s.c . § 553 . on february 11 , 1997 , epa published a notice of proposed-rulemaking in the federal register ( 62 fed . reg . 6365 ) . in addition to the 31 written comments received in response to the notice of proposed-rulemaking , epa held a public-hearing in romulus , michigan , on may 15 , 1997 . epa responds to the comments in the preamble to the final-rule . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 the final-rule contains collections of information which are subject to review and approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) under the paperwork reduction act . epa has submitted the required-documentation to omb and no party need respond to any collection of information until the collection is approved by omb and a control-number is issued . the preamble to the final-rule contains the required-information regarding the collection , including the reason and need for the information , the number of respondents , and an estimate of the annual-burden-hours which will be imposed . the information being collected will allow epa to certify locomotives and locomotive-engines will be in compliance with the applicable-emission-standards . it is estimated that it will average 494 hours per the expected 126 responses from 20 respondents at an annualized capital/startup cost of $ 1.8 million . page 2 gao/ogc-98-46 statutory-authorization for the rule the final-rule was promulgated under the authority of sections 114 , 203 , 204 , 205 , 206 , 207 , 208 , 209 , 213 , 215 , 216 , and 301 ( a ) of the clean-air act as amended in 1990 ( 42 u.s.c . §§ 7417 , 7522 , 7523 , 7524 , 7525 , 7541 , 7542 , 7543 , 7547 , 7549 , 7550 , and 7601 ( a ) ) . executive-order no . 12866 the final-rule was determined to be an `` economically-significant '' regulatory-action under the order . it was reviewed by the office of management and budget and was approved as complying with the requirements of the order on december 17 , 1997 . page 3 gao/ogc-98-46
