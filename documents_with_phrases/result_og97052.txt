( i ) cost-benefit-analysis an economic-impact-analysis is included with the regulatory-impact-analysis at 62 fed . reg . 34389 . according to aphis , if argentina was able to fill its 20 thousand metric-ton ( kt ) quota of nonfed-beef , consumers would save approximately $ 90 million annually . this would be offset , however , by annual-losses of more than $ 40 million to the u.s. dairy and beef-sectors because of lower prices for products . these losses translate into reduced net-farm-income of just over $ 15 per beef-farm and $ 83 per dairy farm . gao/ogc-97-52 ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 on april 18 , 1996 , aphis published its initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis in the preamble to the proposed-rule ( 61 fed . reg . 16978 at 17016 ) . the analysis concluded that , because the rule relaxed the foot and mouth disease-related-restrictions on the importation of beef from argentina , the proposed-rule could have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities in the united states . according to aphis , over 95 percent of the beef and dairy-industries are composed of producers and firms that can be categorized as small according to the small business-administration 's size-classification . the analysis discussed the potential-impact on the u.s. livestock-sector , feedlot-operators , live cattle dealers/transporters , cattle slaughterers/primary processors , and the dairy-industry . the analysis invited-comments on these potential-impacts . on june 26 , 1997 , aphis published its final regulatory-flexibility-analysis ( 62 fed . reg . 34385 at 34389 ) . in that analysis , aphis discusses the reason for the final-rule and the legal-basis for it . it also describes and estimates the number of small-entities affected by the rule and discusses the recordkeeping , reporting , and other compliance-requirements . finally , it describes the alternatives considered in the development of the rule and why it rejected them and adopted the rule as proposed . the alternatives included ( 1 ) not lifting the current-importation-restrictions for beef from argentina and ( 2 ) allowing-importation under either less or more stringent-conditions than those adopted in the rule . aphis rejected the first alternative because it believed scientific-evidence permitted importation of beef from argentina under certain-conditions and not permitting such importation would be contrary to trade-agreements entered into by the united states . aphis rejected the second alternative because it believed that less stringent-mitigating-measures than the ones proposed would increase the risk of the introduction of foot and mouth-disease into the united states and that more stringent-mitigating-conditions would be unnecessarily-restrictive . ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 according to aphis , this rule contains no federal-mandates ( under the regulatory-provisions of title ii of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 ) that may result in expenditures by state , local , and tribal-governments , in the aggregate , or to the private sector , of $ 100 million or more in any one year . page 2 gao/ogc-97-52 ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule was issued as a notice of proposed-rulemaking on april 18 , 1996 ( 61 fed . reg . 16978 ) under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . initially , aphis allowed 90 days for comments , but in response to several-requests that the comment-period be extended , it allowed an additional 60-day comment-period . all comments were due by september 17 , 1996 . during the comment-period aphis also held four public-hearings at which both oral and written comments were received . in total , 113 comments were received from representatives of state and foreign-governments , international economic and political-organizations , veterinary associations , state-departments of agriculture , livestock-industry associations , exporting and importing-industry-associations , and other interested parties . based on the number and complexity of the comments , aphis decided to issue only a small-portion of the proposed-rule at this time and to review and reanalyze the other portions of the rule before issuing them as final . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 according to aphis , the information-collection and recordkeeping-requirements included in this final-rule have been approved by the office of management and budget ( omb ) in accordance with the paperwork reduction act . the assigned omb control-number is 0579-0015 . statutory-authorization for the rule aphis cites as statutory-authorization for this rule 7 u.s.c . §§ 147a , 150ee , 161 , 162 , and 450 ; 19 u.s.c . § 1306 ; 21 u.s.c . §§ 111 , 114a , 134a , 134b , 134c , 134f , 136 , and 136a ; 31 u.s.c . § 9701 ; 42 u.s.c . §§ 4331 and 4332 . executive-order no . 12866 the final-rule is considered to be an `` economically-significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order no . 12866 and was reviewed by omb for compliance with that order . national environmental policy act , 42 u.s.c . §§ 4321 et seq . aphis performed an environmental-assessment and determined that the actions required or authorized by this rule will not present a significant-risk of introducing or disseminating-foot and mouth-disease into the united states and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human-environment . based on those page 3 gao/ogc-97-52 findings , the administrator has determined that an environmental-impact-statement need not be prepared . executive-order no . 12988 according to aphis , this rule has been reviewed under executive-order no . 12988 ( civil-justice-reform ) and has been found to meet the standards set forth in the order . the final-rule preempts all state and local-laws and regulations that are inconsistent with the final-rule , has no retroactive-effect , and does not require administrative-proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule . page 4 gao/ogc-97-52
