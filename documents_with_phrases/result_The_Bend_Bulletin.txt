the bend bulletin high court judge visits bend to promote better legal-aid matthew taran thursday , october 24 , 2002 when an oregon supreme court justice arrived at central oregon's office of legal-aid-services wednesday evening about 30 minutes late and with wind-blown-hair , nobody thought much of it . then again nobody attending an open-house to discuss legal-aid-funding and service-issues in the state knew exactly what thomas a. balmer went through to give a speech on the subject . halfway to bend on his drive-form salem , balmer 's old volvo wagon started-smoking and died . only as far as the santiam pass , there was no time to spare . balmer grabbed the paper that he had jotted notes for his speech on and abandoned his neck-tie and formerly reliable-vehicle . it had been a long time since he flagged a ride with his thumb , but he was desperate . luckily a mustang-convertible headed for bend offered a lift . a little-car-trouble was n't about to keep him from delivering his message . `` through support for legal-aid we can make sure we are not closing-courthouse-doors on anybody , '' balmer told about 20 lawyers , judicial and legislative-leaders during the open-house . oregon 's 16 legal-aid-offices strive to provide civil legal-services for the state 's lowincome-population . about 20 percent of oregon residents qualify for the legal-aid but only about 111 lawyers ( less than 1 percent of the bar ) compose the state 's legal-aid-services network . legal-aid-offices reject two out of three people that qualify for help and have a legitimate-grievance because they do n't have the resources-officials said . oregon is meeting 18 percent of the need for civil legal-services to low-income oregonians , according to a legal need study . `` the biggest crisis is federal-funding , '' said bob turner , director of central oregon regional-office in bend . `` federal-funding is half of what it was in 1980 . '' in 1996 legal-aid-services were nearly eliminated by u.s. house leaders . instead , they cut funding by $ 122 million , causing 300-office-closures and 900 attorney-layoffs nationwide . federal-funding-accounts for about one third of oregon's estimated $ 11.5 legal-aid-budget . the remainder comes from filing-fees , interest on lawyer 's trust-accounts , contributions from attorneys , foundation-grants and corporate-support . with that money legal-aid provides the poor , elderly , disabled , unemployed and disadvantaged-population with civil legal-services . they help those people with housing , domestic-violence , divorce , child-custody and employment-cases . a big-part of legal-aid 's success depends on pro-bono , or free , work by lawyers . `` legal-aid is so important for our community and country because people need to have access to the court-system , '' former-state sen. neil bryant said . for that reason it 's too important for lawyers not to participate pro-bono , he said . retired-judge joseph thalhofer agreed . at wednesday 's open-house the local-office honored him with an award for his dedication to providing pro-bono legal-assistance for low-income-seniors in central oregon . `` it 's kind of fun doing this pro-bono-work , '' thalhofer said .
