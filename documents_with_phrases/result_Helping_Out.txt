helping out at tax times by anthony perez cassino for the past few weeks my usual-stack of junk-mail has been supplemented with a steady-stream of 2001-tax-statements and forms , reminding me that the clock has begun ticking towards april 15 . i admit that even though my taxes are relatively-simple and i took a tax-course in law-school , i still hire an accountant to complete the forms . i found law-school-discussions concerning the concept of '' basis '' or `` stepped-up-basis '' to be about as easy to follow as the rule against perpetuities . of course , the one tax-concept that we all understand is an audit . the prospect of being audited may be one of life 's most stressful-experiences , so i can only imagine how daunting it would be if i had to do so without any professional-assistance . but that is the exact-situation that many low- and moderate-income-taxpayers face when being audited by the internal revenue service . with the push in recent years to move people from welfare to work , there are many new low-wage-first-time-filers , who are often automatically audited . still others fail to file , file incorrectly or fail to take advantage of programs like the earned income tax-credit . legal-clinics in an effort to redress this problem , the irs has taken the unusual-step of funding legal-clinics that assist low-income taxpayers . under the project , which was created as part of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 , the irs provides funding to programs that offer tax-education and representation to low-income-individuals . this may seem a little-bit like supplying a rival-army with ammunition , but in fact it is entirely-consistent with the stated-mission of the irs . in a press release referring to the program , irs commissioner charles o. rossotti stated that the clinics mesh with the irs mission-statement of providing `` america's taxpayers top-quality-service by helping them understand and meet their tax-responsibilities by applying the tax-law with integrity and fairness to all . '' he went on to say that `` these clinics fill a critical need . they reach out to help people who frequently have nowhere else to turn for legal-assistance on tax-matters . '' a number of programs in new york that are funded by the irs rely heavily on volunteer-lawyers to serve clients , including the brooklyn low-income-taxpayer clinic of south brooklyn legal-services and the low-income-taxpayer clinic operated by the legal-aid society's volunteer division . these programs address a valid-complaint by corporate-tax-lawyers that there are not enough-opportunities for them to use their unique-skills to help individuals on a pro-bono basis . however , participation in a taxpayer-clinic is not solely limited to tax-experts since these programs provide extensive training and mentoring . one of the most important-services provided to clients of taxpayer-clinics is assistance in seeking a refund under the earned income tax-credit provisions . while every year brings a new round of partisan-battles in washington over the tax-code , the eitc program is one proposal that satisfies a broad-cross-section of the political-spectrum . it is a vital-income-supplement and work incentive-program targeted to low-income working-families with children . it has been called the nation 's most successful anti-poverty-program , distributing over $ 30 billion of assistance to almost 19 million families . twenty-eight-percent of the families that benefited from the program had incomes below $ 10,000 and 60 percent were below $ 20,000 . in 1999 , it lifted more than 4.8 million individuals out of poverty . despite all of its success , there are still many families who do not apply for the credit because of a lack of awareness . ironically , for those who do apply , the eitc represents the fourth largest area for audits by the irs . both of these scenarios point to the importance of having professional-assistance throughout this process , and to the vital-role of the low-income-taxpayer-clinics . although these clinics are relatively new , they have been well-received by volunteer-lawyers who have been instrumental in establishing the programs . this collaboration is noteworthy for at least two reasons : it is a model for future-partnerships between the government and the private sector , and it is an example of some of the very diverse pro-bono opportunities for lawyers that have been created in recent years . unfortunately , during the past decade government-funding for legal-services for low-income americans has declined at almost all levels . in the mid-1990 's there was a concerted-attempt in congress to eliminate funding entirely for the legal-services corporation , a nationwide-program dedicated to providing civil legal-services to lowincome americans . although the program continues to survive , its funding has been reduced by more than $ 100 million . on the state-level , funding from the interest on lawyer account-fund has decreased by half during the 1990 's due to declining-interest rates . the irs should be commended for recognizing the importance and benefits of ensuring equal-treatment for all taxpayers . just a few years ago , pro-bono-work usually meant-litigation . although litigation continues to be a leading pro-bono activity , new projects have been created that tap into the multitude of expertise within the profession . there are pro-bono programs that now partner with volunteer corporate-lawyers to assist not-for-profits and micro-enterprises as well as on economic-development-projects . the taxpayer-clinic is unique because it is one of the few opportunities for tax-practitioners to assist individual-taxpayers on a pro-bono basis . i can not say that i am prepared to give up my aversion to the tax-code , but the lowincome-taxpayer-clinics are an innovative way for those who are comfortable with its provisions to help others in need . in the case of the earned income tax-credit , it is also a rare-opportunity to significantly enhance the living-situation of a low-income-family by obtaining-funds rightfully-due them . if you would like to get involved , please contact the brooklyn low-income-taxpayer clinic of south brooklyn legal-services at ( 718 ) 2375500 or the low-income-taxpayer clinic operated by the legal-aid society 's volunteer division at ( 212 ) 426-3094 .
