legal-aid seeks to balance scales of justice tuesday , september 3 , 2002 andrew tilghman five times more needy-people ask for help than staff can assist albany in the morning , the phones ring relentlessly at albany's legal-aid-office , each call bringing another story of low-income troubles , legal-crisis or bureaucratic-confusion . the office usually is so overwhelmed , attorneys who work there say , that they have to stop taking-calls and evaluating new cases for the day by 10 a.m . the calls come from people like tina lavery of scotia , wife of a self-employed-auto-mechanic . she called legal-aid after months of wrangling with federal-bureaucrats who denied her request for financial-help -- about $ 6,000 a year -- to provide speech-therapy for her 2-year-old son , who was born with autism . `` they almost always deny you at first , '' lavery said . `` you have to have a lawyer to show them you mean business . '' lavery considers herself among the fortunate few whose cases are accepted by legal-aid , one of the only places in the capital region that provides free legal-services for civil-matters such as custody-battles , landlord-tenant-disputes or public-assistance-appeals . legal-aid-workers say their 13-attorney staff can provide full services for only about one in every five people who ask for them , leaving many to fend for themselves . unlike criminal-court , where those accused have a constitutional right to a taxpayerfunded-attorney , people facing civil-matters either have to hire their own lawyer -- often at rates of more than $ 200 an hour -- or go it alone . `` there is a whole-class of people who do n't get in , '' said lillian moy , executive director of the legal-aid society of northeastern new york . `` and for them , the price for losing your house or losing your kids or not getting the income the household needs is incredibly-significant . '' in many cases , poor-people have to face off alone against adversaries who have attorneys . in landlord-tenant-cases , landlords are almost always represented , tenants almost never . in the family-courts , single-parents who ca n't afford attorneys sometimes have to go up against former-spouses who can afford legal-representation . although the courts often try to find court-appointed-attorneys to represent those who do n't have them , there is no guarantee . `` clearly , it 's not fair . there is a disparity : people of economic-means will generally do better in the judicial-system than those without economic-means , '' said thomas levin , chairman of the new york state-bar-association 's access to justice committee . and the ripple-effects can be felt throughout the court-system , as judges have to stop and explain basic-rules that people with lawyers would already understand . `` it usually takes longer because you have to sort of nurse the people through the process , '' said dennis duggan , an albany county family-court-judge who said he often sees people handling their own cases . legal-aid spends about $ 2 million a year culled from a variety of state and federal-sources . a large-portion comes from the interest generated by the state's escrow-accounts that is set aside by law for low-income legal-services . the office serves about 4,500 people a year . about 81 percent receive only limited-services , such as a single consultation , rather than full-time-representation . no-cost legal-services also are offered to a more limited-degree from places such as the women 's bar-association of the capital district or student-clinics at albany law-school . but for lawyers who spend most of their time practicing other areas of the law , pro-bono-cases concerning-aspects of family-law or public-assistance can be difficult , levin said . the vast majority of cases never involve a trial and can be taken care of administratively . `` it 's such a bureaucracy that poor-people deal with that a lot of it is just straightening-things out , '' said anne erickson , executive director of the greater upstate law project , which provides support-services and updated legal-information for offices like legal-aid . lavery said the help she got from legal-aid , and the social-security-benefits it helped her secure , have been invaluable . `` i honestly believe if it was n't for them , i never would have gotten it . i 'd probably still be fighting , '' she said .
