2.1 introduction 2.1.1 the objective of aquatic-toxicity-tests with effluents or pure-compounds is to estimate the `` safe '' or `` no-effect '' concentration of these substances , which is defined as the concentration which will permit normal-propagation of fish and other aquatic-life in the receiving-waters . the endpoints that have been considered in tests to determine the adverse-effects of toxicants include death and survival , decreased-reproduction and growth , locomotor-activity , gill ventilation-rate , heart-rate , blood-chemistry , histopathology , enzyme-activity , olfactory function , and terata . since it is not feasible to detect and/or measure all of these ( and other possible ) effects of toxic-substances on a routine-basis , observations in toxicity-tests generally have been limited to only a few effects , such as mortality , growth , and reproduction . 2.1.2 acute-lethality is an obvious and easily observed-effect which accounts for its wide-use in the early-period of evaluation of the toxicity of pure-compounds and complex-effluents . the results of these tests were usually expressed as the concentration lethal to 50 % of the test-organisms ( lc50 ) over relatively-short exposure-periods ( one-to-four-days ) . 2.1.3 as exposure-periods of acute-tests were lengthened , the lc50 and lethal-threshold-concentration were observed to decline for many compounds . by lengthening the tests to include one or more complete-life-cycles and observing the more subtle-effects of the toxicants , such as a reduction in growth and reproduction , more accurate , direct , estimates of the threshold or safe-concentration of the toxicant could be obtained . however , laboratory-life-cycle tests may not accurately estimate the `` safe '' concentration of toxicants because they are conducted with a limited-number of species under highly controlled , steady-state-conditions , and the results do not include the effects of the stresses to which the organisms would ordinarily be exposed in the natural environment . 2.1.4 an early published account of a full-life-cycle , fish toxicity-test was that of mount and stephan ( 1967 ) . in this study , fathead-minnows , pimephales promelas , were exposed to a graded series of pesticide-concentrations throughout their life-cycle , and the effects of the toxicant on survival , growth , and reproduction were measured and evaluated . this work was soon followed by full-life-cycle tests using other toxicants and fish-species . 2.1.5 mckim ( 1977 ) evaluated the data from 56 full-life-cycle tests , 32 of which used the fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , and concluded that the embryo-larval and early juvenile-life-stages were the most sensitive-stages . he proposed the use of partial-life-cycle toxicity-tests with the early-life-stages ( els ) of fish to establish water-quality-criteria . 2.1.6 macek and sleight ( 1977 ) found that exposure of critical life-stages of fish to toxicants provides estimates of chronically-safe concentrations remarkably-similar to those derived from full-life-cycle toxicity-tests . they reported that `` for a great-majority of toxicants , the concentration which will not be acutely-toxic to the most sensitive-life-stages is the chronically-safe concentration for fish , and that the most sensitive-life-stages are the embryos and fry . '' critical life-stage exposure was considered to be exposure of the embryos during most , preferably all , of the embryogenic ( incubation ) period , and exposure of the fry for 30 days post-hatch for warm-water-fish with embryogenic-periods ranging from one-to-fourteen-days , and for 60 days post-hatch for fish with longer embryogenic-periods . they concluded that in the majority of cases , the maximum acceptable-toxicant-concentration ( matc ) could be estimated from the results of exposure of the embryos during incubation , and the larvae for 30 days post-hatch . 2.1.7 because of the high cost of full-life-cycle fish toxicity-tests and the emerging-consensus that the els test-data usually would be adequate for estimating chronically-safe concentrations , there was a rapid-shift by aquatic-toxicologists to 30- to 90-day els toxicity-tests for estimating chronically-safe concentrations in the late-1970s . in 1980 , usepa adopted the policy that els test-data could be used in establishing water-quality-criteria if data from full-life-cycle-tests were not available ( usepa , 1980a ) . 2.1.8 published reports of the results of els tests indicate that the relative-sensitivity of growth and survival as endpoints may be species dependent , toxicant dependent , or both . ward and parrish ( 1980 ) examined the literature on els tests that used embryos and juveniles of the sheepshead-minnow , cyprinodon-variegatus , and found that growth was not a statistically-sensitive indicator of toxicity in 16 of 18 tests . they suggested that the els tests be shortened to 14 days posthatch and that growth be eliminated as an indicator of toxic-effects . 2.1.9 in a review of the literature on 173 fish full-life-cycle and els tests performed to determine the chronically-safe concentrations of a wide variety of toxicants , such as metals , pesticides , organics , inorganics , detergents , and complex-effluents , woltering ( 1984 ) found that at the lowest effect-concentration , significant-reductions were observed in fry-survival in 57 % , fry-growth in 36 % , and egg-hatchability in 19 % of the tests . he also found that fry-survival and growth were very often equally-sensitive , and concluded that the growth-response could be deleted from routine-application of the els tests . the net-result would be a significant-reduction in the duration and cost of screening-tests with no appreciable-impact on estimating-matcs for chemical-hazard-assessments . benoit et al . ( 1982 ) , however , found larval-growth to be the most significant-measure of effect and survival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in early life-stage-tests with four organic-chemicals . 2.1.10 efforts to further reduce the length of partial-lifecycle toxicity-tests for fish without compromising their predictive-value have resulted in the development of an eight-day , embryo-larval-survival and teratogenicity-test for fish and other aquatic-vertebrates ( usepa , 1981 ; birge et al. , 1985 ) , and a seven-day-larval-survival and growth-test ( norberg and mount , 1985 ) . 2.1.11 the similarity of estimates of chronically-safe concentrations of toxicants derived from short-term , embryo-larval-survival and teratogenicity-tests to those derived from full-life-cycle-tests has been demonstrated by birge et al . ( 1981 ) , birge and cassidy ( 1983 ) , and birge et al . ( 1985 ) . 2.1.12 use of a seven-day , fathead-minnow , pimephales promelas , larval-survival and growth-test was first proposed by norberg and mount at the 1983 annual-meeting of the society for environmental toxicology and chemistry ( norberg and mount , 1983 ) . this test was subsequently used by mount and associates in field-demonstrations at lima , ohio ( usepa , 1984 ) , and at many other locations ( usepa , 1985c , usepa , 1985d ; usepa , 1985e ; usepa , 1986a ; usepa , 1986b ; usepa , 1986c ; usepa , 1986d ) . growth was frequently found to be more sensitive than survival in determining the effects of complex-effluents . 2.1.13 norberg and mount ( 1985 ) performed three single-toxicant fathead-minnow larval-growth-tests with zinc , copper , and dursban® , using-dilution-water from lake superior . the results were comparable to , and had confidence-intervals that overlapped with , chronic-values reported in the literature for both els and full-life-cycle-tests . 2.1.14 usepa ( 1987b ) and usepa ( 1987c ) adapted the fathead-minnow larval-growth and survival-test for use with the sheepshead-minnow and the inland-silverside , respectively . when daily-renewal 7-day sheepshead-minnow larval-growth and survival-tests and 28-day els tests were performed with industrial and municipal-effluents , growth was more sensitive than survival in seven out of 12 larval-growth and survival-tests , equally-sensitive in four tests , and less sensitive in only one test . in four cases , the els test may have been three to 10 times more sensitive to effluents than the larval-growth and survival-test . in tests using-copper , the no observable-effect-concentrations ( noecs ) were the same for both types of test , and growth was the most sensitive-endpoint for both . in a four laboratory-comparison , six of seven tests produced identical-noecs for survival and growth ( usepa , 1987a ) . data indicate that the inland-silverside is at least equally-sensitive or more sensitive to effluents and single-compounds than the sheepshead-minnow , and can be tested over a wider salinity-range , 5-30‰ ( usepa , 1987a ) . 2.1.15 lussier et al . ( 1985 ) and usepa ( 1987e ) determined that survival and growth are often as sensitive as reproduction in 28-day life-cycle-tests with the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia . 2.1.16 nacci and jackim ( 1985 ) and usepa ( 1987g ) compared the results from the sea-urchin fertilization-test , using organic-compounds , with results from acute-toxicity-tests using the freshwater-organisms , fathead-minnows , pimphales promelas , and daphnia-magna . the test was also compared to acute-toxicity-tests using atlantic silverside , menidia-menidia , and the mysid , mysidopsis-bahia , and five metals . for six of the eight organic-compounds , the results of the fertilization-test and the acute-toxicity-test correlated well ( r2 = 0.85 ) . however , the results of the fertilization-test with the five metals did not correlate well with the results from the acute-tests . 2.1.17 usepa ( 1987f ) evaluated two industrial-effluents containing heavy-metals , five industrial-effluents containing organic-chemicals ( including-dyes and pesticides ) , and 15 domestic wastewaters using the two-day red-macroalga , champia-parvula , sexual-reproduction-test . nine single-compounds were used to compare the effects on sexual-reproduction using a two-week-exposure and a two-day-exposure . for six of the nine compounds tested , the chronic-values were the same for both tests . 2.1.18 the use of short-term-toxicity-tests in the npdes program is especially-attractive because they provide a more direct-estimate of the safe-concentrations of effluents in receiving-waters than was provided by acute-toxicity-tests , at an only slightly increased level of effort , compared to the fish full-life-cycle-chronic and 28-day els tests and the 28-day mysid life-cycle-test . 2.2 types of tests 2.2.1 the selection of the test-type will depend on the npdes permit-requirements , the objectives of the test , the available-resources , the requirements of the test-organisms , and effluent characteristics such as fluctuations in effluent-toxicity . 2.2.2 effluent chronic-toxicity is generally measured using a multi-concentration , or definitive-test , consisting of a control and a minimum of five effluent-concentrations . the tests are designed to provide dose-response-information , expressed as the percent-effluent concentration that affects the survival , fertilization , growth , and/or development within the prescribed-period of time ( 40 minutes to seven days ) . the results of the tests are expressed in terms of either the highest concentration that has no statistically-significant observed-effect on those responses when compared to the controls or the estimated-concentration that causes a specified-percent-reduction in responses versus the controls . 2.2.3 use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single-effluent concentration ( e.g. , the receiving-water-concentration or rwc ) and a control is not recommended . if the npdes permit has a whole effluent-toxicity-limit for acute-toxicity at the rwc , it is prudent to use that permit-limit as the midpoint of a series of five effluent-concentrations . this will ensure that there is sufficient-information on the dose-response-relationship . for example , if the rwc is > 25 % then , the effluent-concentrations utilized in a test may be : ( 1 ) 100 % effluent , ( 2 ) ( rwc + 100 ) /2 , ( 3 ) rwc , ( 4 ) rwc/2 , and ( 5 ) rwc/4 . more specifically , if the rwc = 50 % , the effluent-concentrations used in the toxicity-test would be 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % , and 12.5 % . if the rwc is < 25 % effluent the concentrations may be : ( 1 ) 4 times the rwc , ( 2 ) 2 times the rwc , ( 3 ) rwc , ( 4 ) rwc/2 , and ( 5 ) rwc/4 . 2.2.4 receiving ( ambient ) water-toxicity-tests commonly employ two treatments , a control and the undiluted receiving-water , but may also consist of a series of receiving-water dilutions . 2.2.5 a negative-result from a chronic-toxicity-test does not preclude the presence of toxicity . also , because of the potential-temporal-variability in the toxicity of effluents , a negative-test-result with a particular-sample does not preclude the possibility that samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronic-toxicity . 2.2.6 the frequency with which chronic-toxicity-tests are conducted under a given npdes permit is determined by the regulatory-agency on the basis of factors such as the variability and degree of toxicity of the waste , production-schedules , and process-changes . 2.2.7 tests recommended for use in this methods-manual may be static-non-renewal or static-renewal . individual-methods specify which type of test is to be conducted . 2.3 static-tests 2.3.1 static-non-renewal tests - the test-organisms are exposed to the same test-solution for the duration of the test . 2.3.2 static-renewal-tests - the test-organisms are exposed to a fresh-solution of the same concentration of sample every 24 h or other prescribed-interval , either by transferring the test-organisms from one test-chamber to another , or by replacing all or a portion of solution in the test-chambers . 2.4 advantages and disadvantages of toxicity-test types 2.4.1 static-non-renewal , short-term-toxicity-tests : advantages : 1 . simple and inexpensive . 2 . more cost effective in determining-compliance with permit conditions . 3 . limited-resources ( space , manpower , equipment ) required ; would permit staff to perform more tests in the same amount of time . 4 . smaller volume of effluent required than for static-renewal or flow-through-tests . disadvantages : 1 . dissolved oxygen ( do ) depletion may result from high chemical-oxygen-demand ( cod ) , biological-oxygen-demand ( bod ) , or metabolic-wastes . 2 . possible-loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or adsorption to the exposure-vessels . 3 . generally less sensitive than renewal because the toxic-substances may degrade or be adsorbed , thereby reducing the apparent-toxicity . also , there is less chance of detecting-slugs of toxic-wastes , or other temporal-variations in waste-properties . 2.4.2 static-renewal , short-term-toxicity-tests : advantages : 1 . reduced possibility of do depletion from high cod and/or bod , or ill-effects from metabolic-wastes from organisms in the test-solutions . 2 . reduced possibility of loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or adsorption to the exposure-vessels . 3 . test-organisms that rapidly deplete-energy-reserves are fed when the test-solutions are renewed , and are maintained in a healthier-state . disadvantages : 1 . require greater volume of effluent than non-renewal-tests . 2 . generally less chance of temporal-variations in waste-properties . section 3 health and safety 3.1 general precautions 3.1.1 each laboratory should develop and maintain an effective-health and safety-program , requiring an ongoing-commitment by the laboratory-management and includes : ( 1 ) a safety-officer with the responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a safety-program ; ( 2 ) the preparation of a formal , written , health and safety-plan , which is provided to the laboratory-staff ; ( 3 ) an ongoing-training-program on laboratory-safety ; and ( 4 ) regularly scheduled , documented , safety-inspections . 3.1.2 collection and use of effluents in toxicity-tests may involve significant-risks to personal-safety and health . personnel collecting effluent-samples and conducting-toxicity-tests should take all safety-precautions necessary for the prevention of bodily injury and illness which might result from ingestion or invasion of infectious-agents , inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxic-substances through skin-contact , and asphyxiation due to a lack of oxygen or the presence of noxious-gases . 3.1.3 prior to sample-collection and laboratory-work , personnel should determine that all necessary-safety-equipment and materials have been obtained and are in good-condition . 3.1.4 guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous-materials must be strictly followed . 3.2 safety-equipment 3.2.1 personal-safety gear 3.2.1.1 personnel must use safety-equipment , as required , such as rubber-aprons , laboratory-coats , respirators , gloves , safety glasses , hard-hats , and safety-shoes . plastic netting on glass beakers , flasks and other glassware minimizes breakage and subsequent-shattering of the glass . 3.2.2 laboratory-safety equipment 3.2.2.1 each laboratory ( including mobile-laboratories ) should be provided with safety-equipment such as first aid-kits , fire-extinguishers , fire-blankets , emergency-showers , chemical-spill clean-up-kits , and eye-fountains . 3.2.2.2 mobile-laboratories should be equipped with a telephone to enable personnel to summon help in case of emergency . 3.3 general laboratory and field operations 3.3.1 work with effluents should be performed in compliance with accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardous-materials ( see safety-manuals listed in section 3 , health and safety , subsection 3.5 ) . it is recommended that personnel collecting-samples and performing-toxicity-tests should not work alone . 3.3.2 because the chemical-composition of effluents is usually only poorly known , they should be considered as potential-health hazards , and exposure to them should be minimized . fume and canopy hoods over the toxicity-test-areas must be used whenever possible . 3.3.3 it is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the body immediately after collecting effluent-samples . 3.3.4 all containers should be adequately labeled to indicate their contents . 3.3.5 staff should be familiar with safety-guidelines on material safety data sheets for reagents and other chemicals purchased from suppliers . incompatible-materials should not be stored together . good-housekeeping contributes to safety and reliable-results . 3.3.6 strong-acids and volatile organic-solvents employed in glassware-cleaning must be used in a fume-hood or under an exhaust canopy over the work-area . 3.3.7 electrical-equipment or extension-cords not bearing the approval of underwriter-laboratories must not be used . ground-fault interrupters must be installed in all `` wet '' laboratories where electrical-equipment is used . 3.3.8 mobile-laboratories should be properly grounded to protect against electrical-shock . 3.4 disease prevention 3.4.1 personnel handling-samples which are known or suspected to contain human-wastes should be immunized against tetanus , typhoid-fever , polio , and hepatitis b . 3.5 safety-manuals 3.5.1 for further guidance on safe-practices when collecting effluent-samples and conducting-toxicity-tests , check with the permittee and consult general-safety-manuals , including usepa ( 1986e ) , and walters and jameson ( 1984 ) . 3.6 waste disposal 3.6.1 wastes generated during toxicity-testing must be properly handled and disposed of in an appropriate-manner . each testing facility will have its own waste-disposal-requirements based on local , state and federal-rules and regulations . it is extremely-important that these rules and regulations be known , understood , and complied with by all persons responsible for , or otherwise involved in , performing toxicity-testing-activities . local-fire-officials should be notified of any potentially-hazardous conditions .
