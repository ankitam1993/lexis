using tech-tools to serve the underserved by wendy r. leibowitz lexisone technology is slowly transforming pro-bono efforts , on and off the web . but there is still a long way to go . pro-bono has come a long way in a short time . susan m. hoffman , the pro-bono coordinator at washington , d.c. 's crowell & moring , regularly receives queries from non-profit-organizations via email . she compiles the emails into different-messages and distributes them to lawyers in her firm , who volunteer , sometimes via email , to take the cases . `` i have a political-asylum email list , a domestic-violence-list , a hotline-list , and so on , '' she says . she carefully notes the referring-organization - catholic-charities legal network , or the fair-housing council of greater washington - in each email . ms. hoffman also maintains her own database of attorney interests . `` i can go in and search and pull up an attorney interested in child-abuse and neglect , so when i get a case , i can target it , '' she says . recently she had lunch with some of the referring legal-assistance organizations to try to improve their recruitment and matching-efforts even more . she also sends around pro-bono email questionnaires to find out which types of cases-attorneys are most interested in . technology is transforming pro-bono but there is a great deal to do , particularly as many legal-assistance-agencies still lack basic technology , such as internet-connections . those places need donations of good-equipment as much or more than they need donations of lawyer-hours . but as lawyers try to meet demands with technology , the basic-needs remain : meeting the need for legal-services among the poor or underserved . some of the unmet-needs are among people who can pay , but who are deterred from seeking a lawyer because of the uncertainty about legal-fees and their fear of the profession . the british-writer richard susskind calls these potential-clients `` the latent-market . '' small-firms and solos are ideal for such clients , but the clumsy , sometimes impersonal-referral networks , and the prejudice against flat-fee-billing serve as huge barriers between client and lawyer . slowly , web sites are emerging to serve them : divorcelawinfo.com helps people educate themselves about divorce ; mycounsel.com is aimed at small businesses , and there are many others , including nolo.com , which helps people help themselves , without a lawyer . but there is little public-awareness of these sites at present . a recent front page story in the new york times featured a fifteen-year old boy who was answering legal-questions on a web site called askme.com , with knowledge he gleaned solely from court tv and judge judy 's televised courtroom . `` despite public-perceptions to the contrary , there is an enormous-gap between those in need of legal-assistance and the lucky few who manage to find a lawyer to counsel them , '' says esther lardent , president of the pro-bono institute . `` technology is one important-tool to help bridge this gap-by making it easier for lawyers and clients to find each other , making basic legal-information more easily-available , and demystifying the law so that potential-clients are more willing to seek legal-help . '' the need is great . even after it was revealed on askme.com that '' lawguy1975 '' was only fifteen years old , people continued to ask for him by name . for one thing , lawguy 's answers were clear and prompt , while the actual-lawyers ' answers could be turgid , filled with statutory-language , including formal-citations , sometimes posted long after the question appeared . but it 's clear that there are indeed-lawyers out there , many from small-firms , who are ready and able to help . the problem is that boards like askme.com do n't do a good job of matching-lawyers who are licensed in a particular-jurisdiction ( or , in the case of lawguy1975 , licensed at all ) with clients in the same area . the need to distinguish between any legal-information , which lawguys can provide , and good guidance , which knowledgeable-lawyers can provide , remains paramount . one area where lawyers are reaching out effectively to clients over the web is immigration-law . sites such as www.visalaw.com , or www.shusterman.com , provide a wealth of information in several languages , free-email-newsletters , and up-to-date , targeted guidance . greg siskind , who launched visalaw.com , says he is working on building personal , secure-web-sites for each client who wants one , so people can check the status of their cases without having to call the firm . tight immigrant-networks ( the personal-kind ) help publicize the most effective-attorneys . and immigration is ideal for the web : it 's a federal , forms-based-practice that rarely requires meeting the client . but in practice-areas other than immigration , linking-lawyers with clients still revolves around either asking your relatives and neighbors if they know a lawyer , or calling a bar-association and getting the next-name on the list . a plethora of listings are available at lawyers.com , but the amount of information is almost overwhelming to the novice . recently , the american bar-association launched findlegalhelp.org . like like many aba-sites , it takes a while to download , and it requires a few clicks to actually find a lawyer , but once you plow your way through a few screens , you find that the aba has placed an asterisk next to associations that have earned the aba 's approval : i-lawyer.com* chicago bar association* los angeles county bar lawyer referral service* assoc . of the bar of the city of new york lawyer referral service* of course , if you 're not in those areas , you 're back to askme.com or freeadvice.com or ripoffcity.com . some wonderful legal-service agencies , such as the national association of public-interest-lawyers , ( napil ) , at www.napil.org , have web sites that are devoid of explanations about what public-interest-lawyers really do , and which appear to be so corporate in appearance that they could just as easily be an annual report . many of the materials are posted only in pdf ( portable-document-format ) , which must be downloaded to be read . private-practioners must step up to the plate to reach out to the clients , online , if only to save the image of the profession from lawguy1975 and napil . remember that contacting legal-agencies for pro-bono clients can lead to paying-work . volunteer-lawyers for the arts , veterans ' organizations , the legal-aid society-these are networks bigger than most corporate networks , involving-contract-disputes , benefits work , contacts with large-government-agencies that themselves could be the source of work . arts contacts bring in contract-disputes , copyright disputes , even international artistic-disputes , as when a young-artist displayed his work in brussels , only to see his work destroyed . when small-firms and solos do use technology to help smaller clients , the resulting-publicity can generate much good-will . sole-practitioner carolyn elefant , frustrated that u.s. supreme court cases were posted all over the web , but resources needed to help people in benefits-cases , adoption matters , and landlord/tenant disputes were not , built her own pro-bono library on her web site , at www.his.com/~israel/loce/pro bono/pro bono.html . in addition to being a wonderful-library of resources , it has become a source of referrals , she said . indeed , new web sites can now be a destination for those cold calls ( or e-mails ) seeking legal-help that used to be turned away or sent to the state-bar-association . as most laws vary state-by-state , queries from out-of-state used to meet a dead-end . but now , criminal-law-queries can be referred to families against mandatory-minimums , at www.famm.org , a national-group that might be able to help a caller , no matter where the person is in the united states . more such sites are needed . a major web site dedicated to pro-bono , called probono.net , is seeking-firm to mount and maintain pages within its site dedicated to particular-issues . crowell & moring may take on an employment-law page , says ms. hoffman . basic-grunt-work , such as putting-form-documents and templates on the web , is still needed . `` drafting a complaint in a custody-case is pretty-rudimentary , but can be intimidating '' if you 've never done it before , acknowledges ms. hoffman . probono.net hooks up experienced-lawyers with relative newbies . but what really , really sells pro-bono-cases is that the work is interesting , meaningful and rewarding . they involve direct service . and good-lawyers can and should provide it , using all the tools available in our time . wendy r. leibowitz is an attorney and
