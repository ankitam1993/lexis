'' the fema disaster-number is ( 800 ) 621-3362 . fema inspectors were in kerrville again wednesday , inspecting some damaged-homes . according to lindsay , fema has already received 44,000 inspection requests in texas . the number of individuals seeking-relief from the floods across south texas increased by more than 1,000 tuesday , bringing the total to 5,855 , he said . fema has already distributed $ 1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency-housing . `` the registration-process is going rapidly , '' lindsay said , adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes . aid also is available from the local-chapter of the red cross , but flooding-victims must interview with the red cross separately to receive aid from them , too . daletta andreas , hill country chapter-executive-director , said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with fema or for cleanup-services from local-groups automatically registered them for red cross services . that 's incorrect , andreas said . `` they need to come in and go through our interview-process , '' she said . the red cross service-center , 333 earl garrett st. , is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily , and will be open this weekend , andreas said . people seeking-assistance must provide identification-proving they reside in the area . members of the state-bar of texas are offering free legal-advice for flood-victims . victims in texas counties declared a federal disaster can call ( 800 ) 504-7030 for assistance with basic legal-questions . the free legal-assistance-hotline , operated in coordination with texas rural legal-aid and volunteer-lawyers from across the state , will be available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. , monday through thursday , and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on friday . `` once flood-victims ' immediate-needs are met , they may encounter legal-questions regarding lost-documents , landlord-tenant-disputes , or probate-matters , '' said state-bar president guy harrison of longview . `` we want to do whatever we can to help texans through this trying-time . '' volunteer-lawyers will offer basic-advice , answer legal-questions and provide appropriate-referral information in both english and spanish . callers requiring more detailed-advice or continuing legal-representation may be referred to legal-aid-programs , pro-bono attorneys or private-attorneys .
