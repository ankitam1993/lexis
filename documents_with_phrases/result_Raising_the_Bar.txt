lawyer praised for raising the bar on donations robert lalley appealed to area-lawyers to give more time and money to the poor . this year , they gave morethan a half-million-dollars to western michigan legal-services . hank bornheimer / the grand rapids press grand rapids lawyer robert lalley jr. has never been poor . his middle-class-upbringing in the '50s and '60s produced a comfortable , secure-childhood . the third of seven kids of an fbi agent and a full-time-homemaker , he was educated at catholic central high school and central michigan university and had a promising career , with a law-degree from the university of north carolina . he has practiced-law 28 years now , and he makes a good living . but lalley knows the poor . like many local-lawyers , he has donated many hours of free legal-help over the years . but it was his influence on members of the grand rapids bar-association to increase their financial and legal support for the poor that earned lalley-kudos for saving western michigan legal-services ( wmls ) from near-collapse . western michigan legal-services formerly known as the non-profit legal-aid , honored lalley recently with the 10th annual michael s. barnes award for `` outstanding-service to the low-income-community . '' lawyers call it `` pro-bono '' work , a latin-phrase-meaning , `` for the public-good . '' in praising lalley , wmls director michael chielens said , `` pro-bono lawyers perform a necessary-service to society by increasing access to justice for all people , not just those who have the wealth . '' a co-founder and partner of verspoor , waalkes and lalley , a small-law-firm in the trust building downtown , lalley , 53 , said , he does n't regard his own public-service as anything special . `` it just levels the playing field for them , '' he said . `` they 're just cases of people who need help , but have no idea where to turn . it 's not always for legal-issues . '' it was the day after the ceremony and , modesty aside , he was feeling pleased about the award . `` it 's nice to receive , knowing what kind of lawyer mike barnes was . the previous-winners were all quality-people . '' the late michael barnes , a corporate-lawyer , and the legendary john cummiskey , a labor-lawyer on management 's side , are two of lalley 's heroes . both grand rapids attorneys also were well known in the local and state legal-circle for their heart and hard-work for the poor . while he was president of the grand rapids bar-association in 1995- 96 , lalley decided to make legal-services to the poor a top priority . congress , led by newt gingrich , had cut federal-funding for such services across the board . grand rapids suffered a one-third-reduction . lalley remembers calling a meeting of managing-partners of all the big-law-firms in town to deal with the cutback . he appealed to them to get their lawyers to restore the loss out of their own pockets . he also asked that local-lawyers double the time they gave to the poor . the michigan bar-association guidelines encouraged but never mandated 30 hours a year per lawyer . `` i simply told them we needed-funds , or legal-aid would have been gutted , '' lalley remembers of that meeting . `` i asked for $ 300 per lawyer to make up for the shortfall . just about everyone came through , and they 're still doing it . '' this year , the bar gave more than a half-million-dollars in time and money to wmls , said paul abrahamsen , pro-bono coordinator for the organization . lalley also is enthused about other bar-efforts on behalf of the poor , most notably the legal-assistance center will operate out of the new courthouse . lalley said the center will be staffed by western michigan legal-services and a rotation of volunteers from the bar . the center , spearheaded by local-attorney jon muth , appears to be unique to grand rapids , lalley said . `` the bar raised over a million dollars to fund the office . '' the american bar-association awarded a $ 6,000 grant for the model project . lalley has a general-law-practice , handling most cases , from family-matters to liability-lawsuits . `` i like the variety . there always will be a need for an attorney to do general-law . i probably could still pass the ( state ) bar-exam , '' he says , somewhat in jest , because of all the different-areas of the law still very familiar to him . lalley , carl verspoor and thomas waalkes have been law-partners since 1983 , and together since 1974 when they were beginning lawyers with another firm . `` we 've always gotten along , '' says lalley . he spent his first year out of law-school as a law-clerk for the michigan court of appeals in grand rapids . the job was typically low-paying . he and his schoolteacher-wife , linda , probably didn't know they were starting out on the poor-side . they got married after his first year of law-school . the appeals court-job changed their plans to settle in lansing , halfway between here and saginaw , where she grew up . he still gives time to the bar-association , serving on the pro-bono committee . `` old ( bar ) president should fade away . '' lalley praises the lawyers working for western michigan , legal-services . `` they are the ones who are really dedicated to helping the poor . '' of his own contribution to the poor , lalley-sums it up this way : '' i managed to shut down a few crises in their lives . ''
