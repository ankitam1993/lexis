legal-aid looks to legislators for help by robyn l. minor sunday , january 26 , 2003 still stinging from federal-grant-cuts , kentucky legal aid's director is hoping the general assembly will help heal the wounds . `` we found a sponsor for legislation , '' director scott crocker said . `` rep. charles geveden has introduced legislation that will increase the access to justice supplement on court-filing-fees . '' the legislation would increase that supplement on filing civil-cases from $ 5 to $ 10 in district-courts and from $ 10 to $ 20 in circuit-courts . basic filing-fees would then be $ 55.50 in district-court and $ 118 in circuit . the access to justice fees are sent to a foundation that provides money to legal-aid-services such as bowling green's kentucky legal-aid . that office provides legal-aid in non-criminal cases to low-income , elderly or disabled-residents in 35 counties . the kentucky bar-association is supporting the legislation . `` they felt the additional-filing-fee would not prevent people from being able to file lawsuits , '' crocker said . in fact , the additional-fees will ensure wider access to the judicial-system for kentucky 's poor , said geveden , d-wickliffe . `` i was pleased to ( sponsor the legislation ) because it will provide access to legal-services to the poor and underprivileged in kentucky that otherwise would have been denied them because of federal-budget-cuts and because of some reduction in funds because of state-budget , '' geveden said . statewide , legal-aid-budgets were cut $ 1.58 million . the proposed legislation is expected to generate about $ 1.5 million . because of about $ 300,000 in cuts , kentucky legal-aid in bowling green is in the process of closing its hopkinsville-office and already has closed and consolidated-others . a total of six full-time-positions and one part-time-position , including-attorneys and secretarial or clerical-positions , were eliminated . if legislation passes and more funding comes in , cuts in services would be re-evaluated . the access to justice money is distributed to legal-aid-agencies based on a poverty-population-formula . about 21 percent of the fees would come to this kentucky legal-aid-office , crocker said . `` we have bipartisan-support on this issue and it is n't a tax increase , '' he said . `` ... there is no one actively lobbying against it , so we hope it would pass . '' geveden agrees that the bill 's chances for passage `` are pretty reasonable . '' and while he is pleased to have the endorsement of the bar-association and others , geveden said , `` the best endorsements come from people at home . `` and i think ... they are doing a good job having people contacting-legislators to encourage their support .
