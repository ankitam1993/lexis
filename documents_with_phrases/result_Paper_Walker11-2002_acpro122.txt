integrity : restoring trust in american-business and the accounting-profession ( this document was written by david m. walker , cpa , comptroller general of the united states , based on a speech he gave to the american institute of certified-public accountants ' leadership conference in november 2002 ) november 26 , 2002 our profession , the performance and accountability-profession , currently faces a `` crisis of confidence '' that must be addressed not only for the good of our profession but also for the good of our country and the nation 's capital markets . we are not , however , the only ones who are under the microscope as recent-events in the private sector have made clear . restoring public-trust and confidence in a manner that can be sustained over the long-term will require concerted-actions by a various-parties in order to address some very real systemic-weaknesses plaguing our current corporate-governance , accountability , and related-systems . recent-accountability-breakdowns : recent-accountability-breakdowns in the private sector have come in a variety of forms and bear many names , including enron , worldcom , qwest , tyco , adelphia , global crossing , waste-management , micro strategy , superior federal-savings bank and xerox , just to name a few . a recent u.s. general-accounting-office ( gao ) report highlighted the increasing-frequency and changing-nature of corporate-earnings-restatements . furthermore , the rapid-decline and fall of arthur andersen llp has served as a dramatic-lesson that will no doubt be the subject of many books and business-school-case studies . clearly , some of these breakdowns are more complex and harder to understand than others . the worldcom-failure appears to be a simple matter of not following basic accounting-principles in connection with capitalizing versus expensing certain-items . although all the facts are not known , it is perplexing how such a basic-error involving-billions of dollars could go undetected by the auditors . on the other hand , the enron situation involved-complex transactions with a number of parties and a now apparent-weakness in current generally accepted accounting-principles . others involved simple-matters of greed by corporate-executives and inadequate-oversight and accountability-actions by boards of directors . arthur andersen llp : although there are many dimensions to the current-challenge , let 's start with one of our own : arthur andersen llp ( andersen ) . andersen may have been the auditor for more than its fair-share of the entities associated with the most recent-accountability-failures , but it was not the auditor for all of them . in fact , u.s. securities and exchange commission ( sec ) data disclosed that until 2001 , andersen generally had a lower rate of earnings-restatements for its public company audit-clients than did other major-accounting-firms . in addition , while andersen had certain unusual audit related-policies and practices that were not widely known by its partners and may not be shared by many other firms , it was hardly a rogue-firm in the profession and any assertions to the contrary are not only inaccurate but also inappropriate . such assertions serve to disparage the reputations of the thousands of andersen professionals who did their job right every day and to the very end . such assertions also serve as an attempt to discount the need for meaningful-reform to help prevent future-accountability failures . the andersen story illustrates how a few people can do the wrong thing with catastrophic-consequences for many innocent-parties . it was not long ago that arthur andersen was viewed by many as the premier professional-services-firm in the world . for years , andersen had the reputation of `` thinking straight and talking straight '' and doing what it felt was right in connection with challenging-accounting and reporting-issues - even if the client did n't like the answer . from global-gold-standard to gone in less than two years ! what happened ? as a former andersen partner who severed all ties with the firm in 1998 , i believe that andersen got caught up with a never-ending-quest to grow the top line , grow the bottom line and grow the income of it partners . stated differently , it was primarily focused on maximizing-earnings and not enough on managing-risk , including-risk relating to its hardearned and priceless-reputation . i observed some of these tendencies during the later-stages of my almost 10-year tenure with the firm . these tendencies had not yet reached a critical-level and the firm had not experienced a major public-accountability-failure when i left to return to public-service as comptroller general of the united states in 1998 . evidently these trends became much more pronounced after i left the firm . during the later-part of my tenure with andersen , i expressed my concerns publicly in several-partner-meetings and privately to various internal-players ; however , as someone who had not `` grown up '' with the firm , i found that my actions to speak up - - especially when my views were not consistent with arthur andersen business-unit-leadership 's preferences - - were somewhat counter-cultural . this was most apparent when i expressed my support for george shaheen , the ex-managing-partner of the andersen consulting-business-unit ( now known as accenture ) , to succeed larry weinbach as the managing partner of andersen worldwide , rather than arthur andersen management 's choice of jim wadia , managing partner of the arthur andersen business unit in the united kingdom . ironically , it was george shaheen rather than jim wadia who publicly stated his support for modernizing the attest and assurance-model for the 21st century ! this , along with his leadership-skills , had a lot to do with my support for his candidacy . andersen is not the only organization to be captured by the siren 's song calling for more money , more money and more money . during the past few years , certain-partners strayed from the core-values of leadership , integrity , service and stewardship that made arthur andersen great and caused me to join the firm in 1989 . the result was that a few partners ' actions served to bet the ranch in connection with the firm 's reputation , and they lost the bet ! although some of andersen 's partners and employees may have violated the law and should be held accountable , the justice department 's indictment of the firm resulted in the `` big five '' accounting and consulting-firms becoming the `` big four . '' this served to further reduce competition in a profession of critical-importance to the public that had already consolidated from eight to five major global-firms . it was more than a little ironic that the justice department that opposed the consolidation of the `` big six '' into the `` big five '' caused the further consolidation in the profession . regardless of the methods and motivations of the various-parties , the deed is done , and arthur andersen is essentially-dead . i am proud to have been a partner with arthur andersen in its glory-days , but i 'm shocked and saddened by what happened to the firm during the past few years . clearly , one of the big-lessons from andersen 's fall is that it may take years to create a reputation of quality and integrity but that hard-earned-reputation can be lost very quickly if there is a real or perceived breach of trust . in andersen 's case , it took-decades for andersen to climb to the top and less than two years for it to decline into extinction . hopefully , people will take that lesson to heart . american institute of certified-public accountants ( aicpa ) : andersen 's fall , along with the recent-business-accountability breakdowns and other integrity-failures , has served to adversely impact the public 's trust and confidence not just in cpas , but also in other performance and accountability-professionals , corporate-officials and a variety of other parties . they have also served to adversely affect public-confidence in our nation 's capital markets . many cpas have also shown increasing-concern with recent-actions and inactions of our own professional-association , the american institute of certified-public accountants ( aicpa ) . what are these concerns ? first , the aicpa 's actions in connection with the recent accounting reform-legislation and certain other reform related administrative-actions have damaged its reputation in government and elsewhere . some of its external actions may have been designed to serve the economic-interests of some of its members but they were not necessarily-consistent with the broader public-interest , especially in connection with audits involving public-companies and public-funds . furthermore , some of the aicpa 's recent internal-actions have been questioned by its own membership . for example , the membership soundly rejected the institute 's efforts to further stretch the cpa brand-name and allow others to benefit from our profession 's hard-earned-reputation through the so-called `` xyz initiative . '' other aicpa actions designed to enhance the value of cpas to their clients have met with mixed-results . in addition , some of these have not been a model of transparency or integrity given delayed-disclosures and potential-conflicts of interest . one would expect the aicpa to lead by example in connection with transparency and conflict-issues given the role and nature of the profession that it represents . in my view , the aicpa and its leadership must set the standard for professional-conduct and be beyond reproach because they represent all of us and , as a result their actions , reflect on all of us . clearly , the aicpa 's value-enhancement and trade-oriented efforts have dominated its agenda in recent years . although value-enhancement to the membership is clearly a legitimate-role for the aicpa , as a professional-association it also has a responsibility to aggressively address a range of professional-risk management-issues . in my view , not enough has been done to manage the current and emerging-risks associated with our profession , especially in connection with modernizing the attest and assurance-model and related auditing-standards , including the independence standard for the 21st century . yes , some steps have been taken but not nearly enough or as quickly as is called for , given recent-events and the vital-role that cpas play in our overall accountability-system . as a result , some are questioning the future-role of the aicpa and whether they should continue to renew their membership . i , for one , have renewed my membership . why ? because i believe that it is better to be an active-member who tries to make needed and constructive-changes from the inside rather than voting with my feet and simply walking away . i hope that most of my fellow-members will agree with me . however , i believe that additional-actions by the board and aicpa management will be needed to restore trust and confidence in the institute over the longer-term . corporate-governance : outside-auditors bear varying-degrees of responsibility for these recent-failures , but they do n't bear all the responsibility . where were the boards of directors ( boards ) and what was the role of top corporate-management in connection with these business breakdowns ? what involvement did other key-players have in connection with these accountability-failures ? these and other questions are worth exploring to determine what changes are needed on a going-forward-basis to minimize the possibility that these types of events will occur in the future . in my view , the most critical-element that needs to be addressed to help ensure that these failures do not proliferate in the future is the overall-governance-model for public-companies in the united states . many believe , and i am one of them , that the current u.s. corporate-governance-model for public-companies is not adequate to protect the interests of shareholders and other key-stakeholders . specifically , although most public-companies are required to have a board that is comprised of a majority of '' independent-directors '' and certain key-committees are required to be comprised solely of outside-directors , a closer look reveals that the independence of many boards may be more a matter of form than substance . the issues of concern-start at the top of the corporate-governance pyramid . the ceo of many major public-companies also serves as chairman of the board of directors . as chairman and ceo , this one individual has a huge-impact on the direction of the company , the role of the board , and the composition of the board . all too frequently , such individuals will have significant-influence over who is asked to join the board and who is asked to leave it . boards are often comprised primarily of internal-management officials , high-level-executives from other companies , and major-service-providers to and customers of the company . interlocking-boards are also fairly-common . under such arrangements , executives from different-companies who know each other will sit on each other 's boards . although all these individuals have valuable-experience and perspective to bring to the table , they are not well positioned to address all of the key roles and responsibilities of an independent-board . what should public-company-boards be doing ? under modern governance-theory , the board works for the shareholders and the ceo works for the board . but how can this be if the ceo also serves as chairman of the board ? boards have at least three roles that they need to play . first , they should provide strategic-advice to management in order to help maximize shareholder value . most boards have historically spent most of their time on this role . second , they need to help manage risk , including-risk related to attempts to maximize current-value at the expense of mortgaging the future . risk management must also consider the interests of key-stakeholder groups , such as employees , customers and the communities in which the company operates . finally , boards have a clear-responsibility to hold management accountable for results . this later-element is a major-reason why having a board that is both qualified and independent is so important . board member-qualifications are more than a matter of education and experience , they are also a matter of personal-attributes of which integrity is number one . board independence does not require the elimination of all inside directors but it would seem to call for ensuring that a super-majority of board members are truly-independent both in fact and appearance . having a qualified and independent-board is important but not enough . boards need to have adequate-resources , including having access to their own independent-attorneys and advisors when they believe it is appropriate . board members also must have the time needed to address their various-roles and responsibilities . from a practical-standpoint , this means that active-executives should limit the number of boards they sit on , and all board members need to be comfortable that they can dedicate the time needed to properly discharge their fiduciary-responsibilities . yes , board members have a fiduciary-responsibility to the shareholders that they represent . they must do their best to do the right-thing and not breach their fiduciary-duties through either co-mission or omission . after all , it 's not just what you do that counts , it 's also what you fail to do when circumstances dictate that you should act . executive-compensation : having the right-governance-structure is of critical-importance . it 's also important to consider the nature and reasonableness of the incentives provided to top-management and board members . much has been written regarding the meteoric-rise of executive-compensation in the united states . various-studies have shown how the ratio of executive-compensation to average-employee compensation has risen to levels of irrationality and levels that far exceed those of other major industrialized-nations . how much is a single-executive-worth ? after all , unlike inventors who should be rewarded for innovation resulting from their personal-efforts , leadership of a major public company is a team-effort . despite the assertions of some ceos , while one key player can make a difference , it requires a team of talented executives to add shareholder value and manage shareholder-risk over time . in some cases , one wonders what some highly compensated top-executives were doing to earn their pay given their public statements and testimonies subsequent to the decline of their companies . certain former enron and worldcom-executives come to mind in this regard . it 's not just the total-amount of compensation but the form and structure of executive-compensation-arrangements that is important as well . it is well known that the behavior of individuals is affected by the nature of their compensation-arrangements ; top-executives are no exception . for example , some executives may be tempted to accelerate income or expense-recognition in ways that will serve to help them maximize their bonus-compensation in the current or following year , respectively . boards and auditors need to be vigilant to ensure that any inappropriate-actions are avoided . recently , a significant amount of attention has been focused on the structure of `` stock options '' and the related-accounting treatment . clearly , some amount of stock-compensation makes sense in order to tie the interests of the shareholders with the interests of top-executives ; however , the amount and structure are both important to ensure equity and avoid perverse-incentives to maximize value in the short-term at the expense of the longer-term . there is little-question that some abuse of stock-compensation has occurred . in a large number of cases , key-executives have been granted additional-stock-options or their existing-options have been re-priced ( i.e. , lower strike-price ) because of a decline in the market value of their company 's stock . part of the decline may have been due to general-market-conditions , but it 's doubtful that all of it was . in fact , some or most of the decline could have been due to the failure of management to deliver on their promises . the result is that these executives can make huge-sums if the stock price-rebounds . although some have argued that stock-option-re-loads and re-pricing were necessary to keep their executives , i wonder how many of these executives wanted to give up options or raise the strike-price of their options when general-market-conditions were causing all boats to rise ? i do n't know of any , but maybe you do ! we should not have a heads-i-win and tails-you-lose-compensation structure . this situation could be mitigated if companies had qualified , independent , and adequately resourced-boards ; however , as i noted previously , this is all too often not the case . boards have a responsibility to ensure the reasonableness of overall-executive-compensation . it 's clear that a number of them are not doing an adequate-job in his regard . at the same time , the federal government bears some responsibility for the movement to stock-based-compensation due to tax-changes that limited the deductibility of certain-types and amounts of executive-compensation . these provisions may have to be reexamined as well . from a more strategic-perspective , there is both a need and an opportunity to forge a realignment of interests between the board of directors and auditors in ways that can help to enhance value and manage risk for shareholders and other key-stakeholders . in theory , auditors work directly for the board of directors and indirectly for shareholders . yes , audit-committees of the board interact with and recommend which audit-firm to retain for approval by the shareholders . in the real world , however , top-management has much more influence on and interaction with the outside-auditors . this must change and under the recent-sarbanes-oxley-accounting reform-legislation , some related-changes will be required . importantly , once additional needed corporate-governance-reforms are made to enhance the independence and capacity of the board , the opportunity to implement the needed realignment will be greatly enhanced . accounting and reporting-model : what about the current-accounting and reporting-model ? we have recently seen how current-accounting and reporting-requirements are inadequate . for example , the collapse of enron showed how accounting and reporting for so-called `` special-purpose-entities '' ( spes ) is hard to understand , much less defend . does it make sense for companies to be able to keep significant financial-transactions off their books when unrelated-parties provide only 3 percent of the related-capital at risk ? i think not ! although enron may have violated this 3-percent-requirement , the 3-percent level would seem to be way too low in a environment in which we should be focusing on economic-substance versus legal-form in accounting and reporting as well as attest and assurance-matters . there has also been a considerable-amount of discussion and debate regarding the appropriate-accounting and reporting-treatment for stock options . strong-views are held on both sides of this great-debate . from a practical-perspective , if stock options aren't compensation , what are they ? in my view , it 's not on the issue of whether they should be recorded as compensation expense ; it 's more a matter of how it should be done . from a broader perspective , i believe that the current-accounting and reporting-model is not well suited for our 21st century knowledge-based-economy . unlike the industrial-age in which tangible-assets were of great-value and importance , in today's knowledge-based-economy it 's intellectual-capital that is driving the market value of many enterprises . intellectual-capital is created by the efforts of people . as a result , people represent the most valuable-asset in the knowledge-age . people are the source of all process-improvement , technological-innovation , and environmental-enhancements . if people are our most valuable-asset , then why are people treated primarily as a cost and a liability under our current-accounting and reporting-model ? what about historical-cost ? although it 's nice to know what something costs , it 's arguably more important to know what it is worth ! furthermore , the days when historical financial statements were viewed as being of critical-importance are gone . it 's not that they are n't-important , it 's that they are n't as important as they used to be . today , it 's important to have access to timely and reliable financial and non-financial-performance-information . in addition , it 's important to not just know what has happened but what is likely to happen based on key-performance-indicators , projection , information and sensitivity-analyses . we live in an increasingly inter-dependent-world . our markets are global in nature and no nation , including the united states , can go it alone . and yet , we still lack a set of global-accounting and reporting-standards that reflects the globalization of economies , enterprises , and markets . we need a set of global standards , and various interested parties need to work together to help make this become a reality sooner rather than later . these new accounting and reporting-standards should not just be global in nature , they should be principle-based rather than rule-based . current u.s. accounting and reporting-standards have become much too complex . too many players are looking for special-treatment and loopholes and are focusing on legal-form rather than economic-substance . furthermore , too many professionals are busy checking-boxes rather than turning on their brains and using their professional-judgment to get to the right-answer . we must remember that as cpas , we get paid for our judgment , so let 's exercise it . new principle-based-accounting and reporting-standards should be focused on value and risk . related-disclosures should focus more on key-performance-indicators along with selected projection-information and sensitivity-analyses . in addition , all disclosures need to be stated as clearly and concisely as possible . too many public-companies ' disclosures are written in legal-language and are way too long . they seem to be designed more to confuse rather than inform the reader . some have recently advocated a three-pronged-approach to future financial and performance-reporting . the first prong would represent basic-reporting applicable to all public-companies . the second prong would include key benchmark-information based on the company 's industry . the third-prong would include supplemental-information on key-value and risk-elements affecting the company . i believe that such an approach has conceptual-merit and should be explored along with the other key-concepts outlined above . attest and assurance-standards : although the accounting and reporting-model needs to be updated , in my view , the current-attest and assurance-model is also out of date . the current-model relies heavily on an auditor 's expression of an opinion on historical cost-based financial statements after year-end . for public-companies , audited financial statements generally are required to be filed with the sec within three months of the company 's fiscal-year-end . this report has some value but it is not as valuable as it once was . more needs to done to enhance the scope and improve the timeliness of various-attest and assurance-services and related reporting . more also needs to be done to address the continuing '' expectations-gap '' regarding what auditors are doing in connection with the detection of fraud and internal-controls , and to audit through electronic-information-systems rather than around them . in this regard , texas a & m university has recently formed a new center for continuous-auditing involving a consortium of over 12 leading-universities and others to help address these issues . currently , outside-auditor-reports are not required to provide any level of assurance with regard to key internal-controls . such controls are critical to determining the reliability of interim reporting and various ongoing-assertions by the company throughout the year . importantly , opinion-level of reporting on internal-controls over financial-reporting will be required by the sarbanes-oxley accounting reform-legislation that was passed in july 2002 . it is designed , among other things , to enhance oversight of public-company-auditors in light of recent-accountability-failures . however , the current-audit-reporting-model does not provide any level of assurance regarding key-risk and value-based-performance and projection-information that are important to a wide-range of stakeholders . we also need to take steps to do so in conjunction with the needed-enhancements to the current-accounting and reporting-model . it 's important to enhance the scope and timing of any related audit-reports , but it 's also important to ensure that firms are both qualified and independent to perform such audits . contrary to assertions by some , independence is more than a state of mind . auditors must be independent both in fact and appearance in order to be credible . in my view , current aicpa independence-standards do not adequately ensure the independence of auditors who provide certain-non-audit or consulting services to their audit-clients . as a result , the gao issued new independence-standards applicable to audits of federal-departments and agencies and entities that receive federal-funds , and the sarbanes-oxley-legislation limited the ability of auditors of public-companies to perform certain-non-audit services for their audit-clients . the sarbanes-oxley-provisions were based in large part on gao's new independence-standards . importantly , gao saw the need for a change in his area and we began the process to make related-changes long before enron and other recent-business-failures came to light . although gao took a lot of heat in being out front on this controversial-issue , in part due to recent-events , we 're getting a lot of accolades now ! during the past decade the aicpa and many accounting-firms put too much-emphasis on how they could grow their top line , bottom line , and earnings through pushing non-audit/consulting services and not enough-time modernizing-attest and assurance-services that represent the franchise for cpas on which the public relies . this must change , and recent-events are likely to force both the accounting-profession and the firms to place much more emphasis on their core-services . at the same time , many major-accounting-firms are spinning off the portions of their consulting-practices that pose the greatest potential-independence-problems . in my view , auditors should able to provide some consulting services to their audit-clients , but there are certain-services that would clearly be inappropriate for them to provide . specifically , under the gao 's new independence-standards-auditors must not violate two basic-principles . first , auditors should not perform management-functions or make management-decisions . second , auditors should not audit their own work when the work involved is material to the subject-matter of the audit . these principles are simple , straightforward , and timeless in nature . we also need to take this type of approach in connection with key accounting/reporting and audit-issues . as i noted earlier , the board and the auditors should have a strategic-alignment of interests . furthermore , for any system to function effectively , there must be incentives for parties to do the right-thing , adequate-transparency to provide reasonable-assurance that people will do the right-thing , and appropriate-accountability when people do not do the right-thing . this strategic-realignment and convergence of interests between the board and the outside-auditors would help to achieve these objectives . legal , financial and other advisors : a variety of outside-players other than auditors have been involved in and bear differing-degrees of responsibility for some of the recent-business-failures . attorneys , investment-bankers , consultants and other advisors have played major-roles in structuring or engineering-business-transactions in order to achieve not just a desired business-result but also a desired accounting and reporting-result . in some cases , this has resulted in changing the form of certain-arrangements in order to meet the minimum technical-requirements of any related-accounting and reporting-requirements while coming close to the line of what is legal . some might call this aiding and abetting . many advisors try to help their clients meet a short-term value-oriented-objective . however , in doing so they must remember that short-term-gain can come at a huge-longterm-cost if the transaction-unravels or otherwise comes under close regulatory-review or public-scrutiny . such was clearly the case in connection with certain recent-business-failures . several-companies have used such aggressive-approaches to deal with a variety of tax-issues and other matters . for example , a number of major multi-national-companies based in the united states are trying to have their legal-headquarters located in another country for tax-reasons . typically , companies and their advisors try to minimize the visibility of such techniques in order to avoid public-criticism . sometimes they succeed , and sometimes they do n't . in my view , too many people-today are trying to structure transactions and other business-dealings so they are technically acceptable rather than doing what is right . it is time for people to realize that things like the law and accounting and reporting-standards represent the floor of acceptable-behavior and not the ceiling ! values like integrity , morality , compassion and stewardship represent higher callings that more people should strive to achieve . in the end , we all need to be more responsible for our actions and inactions . the simple-rule is , if in doubt about what to do , then check it out both from a technical and value oriented-perspective . if still in doubt , do n't do it ! it 's not worth betting your reputation or the reputation of your organization . just ask the former-partners and employees of arthur andersen . wall street firms are subject to these same tendencies . they also have certain-conflicts in connection with their investment banking and brokerage-operations that need to be addressed just as independent-auditors do in connection with their consulting services . the independence and objectivity of stock-analysts reporting is also a matter of concern . the sec and several-states are looking into these issues . hopefully , wall street will take voluntary-steps to address these issues before it is forced to act . in the final-analysis , attorneys and other advisors need to keep in mind that their actions can have an adverse-affect on their reputations as well as the public . given the lessons from arthur andersen 's fall , they need to keep this in the forefront rather than the back of their minds . federal-regulation and enforcement : the primary federal-regulator in connection with financial-accounting and reporting for public-companies is the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) . the sec promulgates and enforces the registration-requirements dealing with public-companies . the sec has vast-responsibilities and finite-resources . as a result , they need to constantly look for process-improvements and technological-enhancements to leverage their finite-resources to maximize their effectiveness . in light of recent-events , a consensus has emerged that the sec needs significant additional-resources to help ensure that it can do its job properly . although the sec has the authority to issue certain accounting/reporting and auditing-standards for public-companies , it has historically relied to a great-extent on certain selfregulatory-bodies to help maintain trust and confidence in our nation 's capital markets . for example , it has historically relied on the financial-accounting-standards board ( fasb ) to set generally accepted accounting-principles and the aicpa 's auditing-standards board ( asb ) to set generally accepted-auditing standards . in addition , other parties such as the major-stock-exchanges play a role by imposing various-requirements for companies to attain and maintain their listings . while self-regulatory-approaches can and have worked in various-situations , there are certain-instances in which it is unrealistic for them to work as effectively as needed in order to adequately protect the public-interest . one example of this is in connection with what type of non-audit or consulting services that outside audit-firms can provide to their audit-clients and still maintain their independence . history has shown that the present self-regulatory-structure has not been adequate in this regard . there is too much of a tendency for self-regulatory-structures to rationalize how the provision of a broad-range of services can add value to the client and does not present an independence-problem . this has clearly been the case in connection with the aicpa's current-independence-standards . another area where the current-self-regulatory-structure has proved to be inadequate is in connection with the aicpa's self-disciplinary-function . the process usually takes too long , and in the final-analysis , the most severe-sanction the aicpa can impose is expulsion from the institute . since cpas are not required to belong to the aicpa in order to conduct public-company-audits , the most severe-sanction would only serve to save the cpa some dues without any other practical-effect . this is clearly ineffective ! while the state-boards of accountancy have the ability to impose much stiffer sanctions , including revoking a cpa 's license to practice in a state , these boards have not exercised this sanction very frequently . while i believe that it is not always-desirable to have the government intervene , at times it is necessary in order to protect the public-interest , especially when others who could act fail to do so . recent-examples include actions taken by the congress , the sec and the gao to address-areas of concern that each felt warranted government-action . hopefully , government-intervention can be minimized in the future ; but for that to occur , others must take steps to address serious public-interest-issues before they reach crisis-proportions . if they fail to do so , i have little-doubt that government will eventually act . from an enforcement-perspective , the sec has certain civil enforcement-powers that it can use to address violations of the nation 's securities-laws . in some cases its sanctions are adequate , but not always . most corporate-officials , board members and professionals are people of ability and integrity who try to do the right-thing . at the same time , every country and sector has `` bad-actors '' that take short-cuts and push the envelope to achieve a desired result . many of these players tend to be arrogant and believe that the end justifies the means . in addition , as we have seen in the case of various-derivatives-transactions involving enron , qwest and global crossing , sometimes bad-actors join forces to help achieve their goals . to effectively deal with these types of individuals , civil-sanctions must be strong enough and targeted enough to discourage potential bad-actors from doing things that harm-others . too many existing civil-sanctions are imposed directly or indirectly ( through company paid premiums on officers and directors-insurance ) on the company and ultimately the shareholders . in this case , shareholders can pay twice for the sins of others . while more meaningful and targeted civil-penalties can help to discourage many bad-actors , in my view , civil-sanctions aren't enough in some cases . you need to be able to issue a few so-called '' wide-striped-suits '' to players who violate criminal-statutes . nothing will focus someone 's mind like looking at the world from the inside of a prison-cell . in addition , we need to be sure that white-collar-criminals are not merely detained in so-called '' country-club '' federal-prison-facilities for relatively-short prison-terms . the price for criminal-behavior must be high for these individuals as well . pension and savings plans : the recent-business-failures have also served to harm a number of innocent-parties , including-pension and savings-plan participants . a number of defined-benefit-pension plans lost significant-sums as a result of the decline in the value of their holdings in enron , worldcom , etc . when defined-benefit-pension plans lose money the plan-sponsor , typically the employer , will ultimately bear the cost of the loss . however , when defined contribution-plans , like 401 ( k ) plans , incur such losses , the individual-plan-participants are directly affected and bear the losses themselves . participants in 401 ( k ) plans can be particularly harmed in situations where their accounts are heavily invested in employer stock , either because their employer matches their employee-contributions in the form of such stock or because they themselves make significant-investments in their employer 's stock using their own voluntary-contributions . in these cases , participants-risk losing not only their jobs but also a significant portion of their retirement-savings if their company-files for bankruptcy . this was the case in connection with enron and certain other business failures . in addition , in the enron case , plan-participants were not allowed to sell company-stock in their 401 ( k ) account when the stock price was declining rapidly-due to a pending-change in plan administrators . at the same time , top enron executives were free to exercise their stock options , and some did . this inappropriate and un-level playing field was addressed in part of the sarbanes-oxley-legislation . some suits are likely in order to attempt to right alleged fiduciary-breaches . additional-legislation has also been proposed that would , among other things , give employees the ability to diversify their employer-matching-contributions out of company-stock more rapidly than they can under current-law . past and future actions : a variety of parties have already taken some steps in light of these recent-business-accountability failures . the new york stock exchange is moving to adopt certain-changes in its listing-requirements relating to governance-matters ; boards and audit-committees are taking their related-responsibilities much more seriously ; the financial-accounting-standards board ( fasb ) is exploring a principles-based-approach to accounting-standards and is reconsidering the current-accounting and reporting-treatment for spes and stock options ; the aicpa has issued a new fraud-detection audit-standard and is beginning to assess the need for other enhanced-attest and assurance-standards but it clearly needs to pick up the pace ; the u.s. congress has passed the sarbanes-oxley-legislation which included-establishment of the public company accounting oversight board ( pcaob ) , tougher independence-standards for auditors of public-companies , and independent-funding-sources for the pcaob and the fasb ; the sec has taken a number of regulatory and enforcement-actions and made initial-appointments to the pcaob ; various u.s . attorneys have filed charges against several key-players associated with some of the recent-integrity and accountability-failures ; the new york state attorney-general and the sec are taking-steps to address certain-conflicts within the investment-banking-community , and the gao has taken a number of steps as discussed below . these actions are clearly-steps in the right-direction . however , as noted above , additional-actions are necessary in order to address several remaining systemic-issues . hopefully , the appropriate-parties will take steps to address these issues . if they do n't , the government may chose to act again in order to fill any related-voids . gao 's role : the gao is a professional-services-organization within the legislative-branch of the federal government . our job is to help the congress discharge its constitutional-responsibilities and improve the performance and assure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the american people . to do so , we perform a variety of oversight , insight , foresight and adjudicatory-functions spanning-everything the federal government does or is thinking about doing anywhere in the world . simply stated , at gao we speak truth to power . power comes in many forms , including the u.s. congress , various-government-officials , the press and ultimately the greatest source of power in our democracy - the american people . today , i 'm speaking what i believe to be the truth about how to restore confidence in american-business and our profession to each of you . i will continue to speak out on these issues in the coming months . among other things , gao serves as the independent-auditor of the largest , most diverse and most important-entity on the face of the earth - the u.s. government . we conduct financial-statement , performance and compliance-audits of federal-entities , and promulgate generally accepted-auditing standards for audits of federal-entities , and entities that receive federal-funds . we also help to promulgate generally accepted accounting-principles for federal-government-entities . as the leading-performance and accountability-organization in the united states and arguably the world , we believe that we have an obligation to lead by example and practice what we preach . we take these obligations very seriously with all of our responsibilities , including those relating to the congress' concerns regarding the recent-accountability-failures in the private sector . we held a corporate-governance and accountability-forum in february 2002 involving prominent-leaders from the public , private and not-for-profit-sectors to discuss the recent-accountability-failures in the private sector and what actions may be necessary to help prevent such failures in the future . this forum served to help inform the gao 's work and other efforts to support the congress , including our efforts that helped lead to the eventual-passage of the sarbanes-oxley-legislation . we are holding a follow-up-forum on december 9 , 2002 to discuss what actions have been taken by a variety of parties and those that remain in order to help restore public-trust and confidence . in addition to these actions , gao has voluntarily decided to express an opinion on internal-controls and key-compliance-issues in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government and various other federal-entities . we are also advocating enhanced-reporting in connection with key federal-performance and projection-information . as previously noted , we published new independence-standards dealing with non-audit/consulting services when the aicpa failed to act . we are working with others within the federal government , including the secretary of the treasury and the director of the office of management and budget , to modernize federal financial-management and promote expanded performance and accountability-reporting . furthermore , at gao , we are using the `` bully-pulpit '' and speaking out to encourage others to do their part to help restore public-trust and confidence and we will continue to do so . closing : in the final-analysis , for any system to work you need to assure that the key-people have integrity , that the information provided to key-stakeholders is timely and reliable , and that the persons or entities that are providing-assurance as to the reliability of any financial and non-financial-information are qualified and independent both in fact and appearance . the importance of integrity can not be overstated , if the key-players do n't have integrity , not much else-matters . in addition , systems should incorporate incentives for people to do the right-thing , adequate-transparency mechanisms to provide reasonable-assurance that people will do the right-thing , and appropriate-accountability-mechanisms if people do n't do the right-thing . these basic-principles are timeless and can be applied to a broad-range of professional , business , government and personal-issues , including how to restore trust and confidence not only in the performance and accountability-profession but also in the broader business-community and our nation 's capital markets . i hope that all key-parties will take the necessary-steps to address any real and perceived problems that serve to undercut public-trust and confidence . as recent-events illustrate , trust takes years to gain but can be lost in an instant . the performance and accountability-profession , and in my opinion , our corporate-governance-system are at a critical-crossroads . as cpas we must chose the right-path . if we do , we will not only regain any lost public-trust and confidence in our profession but we can position ourselves to help add value and manage risk in a whole new range of areas that are both needed and which we are well positioned to address a whole new range of performance , projection and compliance-issues . during these challenging-times , cpas must look to what we share in common and how we can help to create the future of our profession . i would suggest that all cpas regardless of what position they hold or what sector they work in share certain-roles , responsibilities and values . with regard to roles , all cpas are in the business of maximizing the performance and assuring the accountability of their enterprises and areas of responsibility . with regard to responsibility , all cpas should be mindful of the broader public-interest in connection with all their activities . with regard to values , all cpas share certain basic-values such as integrity , objectivity , competence and professionalism . in my view , we all need to return to a set of core-values and timeless-principles that can help us to do the right-thing , at the right-time , all the time . these core-values serve as both beliefs and boundaries ; beliefs in the form of positive-concepts one can be committed to , and boundaries in the form of limits that should not be violated . at gao our core-values are accountability , integrity and reliability . accountability describes what we do , integrity describes how we do our work , and reliability describes how we want our work to be received . every world-class-organization should have a set of core-values , and so should our profession . i touched on these earlier . in addition to core-values , we all need to keep certain-timeless principles in mind at al-times . first , do n't believe what gordon gecko said in the film , wall street . greed is not good - greed is bad ! ! second , remember that the law and other standards set the floor of acceptable-behavior and not the ceiling . do n't lie on the floor - reach for the ceiling ! do n't just do what is acceptable , do what you think is right ! third , cpas and other professionals are paid for their judgment . turn on your brain rather than checking-boxes in connection with key-accounting , reporting and auditing-issues . fourth , say what you mean , mean what you say , practice what you preach and lead by example in everything that you do . finally , remember that your reputation is priceless . it takes many years to build a reputation which can be lost very quickly if you breach the trust that others hold in you . in addition , if you act improperly or fail to properly discharge your duties , you can harm a number of innocent-parties . as a result , if it does n't seem right , do n't do it ! ! in closing , we all have a stake in the future of our profession and the reputation of cpas . i can assure you that gao and i will do our part to practice what we preach and lead by example in our roles , responsibilities and values . i hope that i can count on each of you and others to do the same . after all , the time to act is now ! let 's do it ! !
