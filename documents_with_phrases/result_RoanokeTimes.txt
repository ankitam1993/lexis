roanoke times & world news legal-aid-group celebrates 30 years of service paul dellinger thursday , november 14 , 2002 southwest virginia legal-aid serves 17 counties with 14 lawyers and a 32-member staff , but joe tate remembers it did n't start that way . `` the first day i showed up at legal-aid , i interviewed myself , '' he said . he was its only lawyer at first . tate , now in private-practice in marion , was hired as the program 's first director in 1972 after a marion-based-community action-program secured-grant-money to establish the smyth-bland legal-aid society . that was the start of legal-aid in southwest virginia , and tate was among those who gathered here over the weekend to celebrate its 30 years of service . it now covers localities from lee county to christiansburg . `` the smyth county bar was rather-small , and the bland county bar was sam hardy , '' tate said , referring to the man who , for many years , was the only lawyer in bland county . so the effort to bring legal-services to those who could not otherwise afford them began in a small way . many viewed the early legal-aid-lawyers as `` wild-eyed-radicals , '' tate said . `` we started with a budget that today would n't pay the salary of one staff-person . '' the office handled 60 cases in its first year . by 1973 , it had opened an office in abingdon and , in 1976 , in wytheville . most of its early-cases involved-divorce and family-law . in 1978 , it changed its name to southwest virginia legal-aid society . eilene mcilvane , who was not a lawyer , became its executive director in 1981 . by then , the program had added carroll and grayson-counties and the city of galax and had five attorneys . larry harley , who became its executive director in 1993 and still holds that office , joined it in 1975 as a paralegal and came back in 1979 as a lawyer . in the 1960s , harley said , legal-aid-lawyers were banned from practicing in some courts , so the southwest virginia group became partners with the private-bar to avoid that . during the early-1980s , federal-funding for legal-aid was reduced and , by 1984 , only the marion office was still in business . by the late-1980s , state-funding increased . by 1990 , the program's work mainly involved helping-people with food-stamps , housing , health care and other basic-needs . by 1995 , it employed four lawyers . `` we caught our stride in the '80s and '90s . we still have a long way to go , '' harley said . `` i like to think we will never feel that we have arrived . '' the legal-services corp. , which is now the program 's major funding-source , began pushing in 1995 for smaller programs to merge . between 2000 and 2001 , those west of roanoke did . the board of the new river valley legal-aid society voted to join the southwest virginia group . the head of client centered legal-services in the westernmost-part of the state opposed the merger , but the southwest virginia group eventually hired nine former-employees of that agency and opened a new office in the coalfields . its offices are now in castlewood , marion and christiansburg . asked later about the program 's future , harley said it is only now settling in to its expanded service-area and seeking continuing partnerships with the private-bar and various-agencies . `` we 're entering a time of reduced-funding for much of our work , but we just got an increase in our domestic-violence-funding , and we are working closely with the seven-domestic-violence-programs within our service-area , '' he said . the new funding comes through the u.s. department of justice . justice cynthia kinser of the virginia supreme court , keynote speaker for the celebration , said the concept of legal-aid can be traced back to wording in england 's magna carta , but the first version in this country was an 1876 program in new york to help german-immigrants . that organization changed its name to legal-aid society in 1890 . it was the economic opportunity act of 1964 that began providing federal-funding for programs to bring legal-services to the poor , kinser said . `` legal-services has fundamentally changed how government agencies relate to the poor , '' she said .
