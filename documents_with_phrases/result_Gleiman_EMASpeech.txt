edward j. gleiman speech before the envelope manufacturers association williamsburg , va october 29 , 2000 good-morning-ladies and gentlemen . the law provides that the postal-service may , from time to time , request that the postal-rate commission recommend `` rates and fees [ that ] shall provide sufficient-revenues so that total estimated income …to the postal-service will equal as nearly as practicable-total estimated-costs of [ operating ] the postal-service . '' on january 12th the postal-service submitted such a request seeking an additional $ 3.7 million dollars in revenue to be generated by an overall-average rate-increase of approximately 6.4 percent . after lengthy-deliberations , during which the commission held 40 days of hearings to consider 178 pieces of testimony presented by 122 witnesses representing 77 participants , including the postal-service , the commission has concluded that the -- -- wait a minute , i think i picked up the wrong-presentation on my way out of the office-yesterday . let me try again . good-morning-ladies and gentlemen . when maynard invited me to visit with you , i plumb forgot that the commission would be in the final-throes of the r2000-1 rate-case in late october . so , while it would certainly be a pleasure to be here under normal-circumstances , i want to extend a special thanks to you for having me here today . if for no other reason , it has provided an excuse to escape for a day the pressure -- cooker atmosphere associated with putting the finishing-touches on a major rate-case-decision . good lord willing and the creek do n't rise , or perhaps i should say if the computers do n't crash , we hope to have that decision out on monday , november 13th . maynard suggested that i talk about the future -- about postal-reform , its impact on the commission and other changes the postal-community may be facing . before i whip out my somewhat-cloudy crystal-ball , i thought you might be interested in a brief-outline of the process currently associated with postal-rate-making . and , as i talk about the process , i will attempt to debunk a few myths and set the record straight on what you may have heard at previous get togethers . i will also talk about an issue that i believe has greater potential to impact the future-well-being of the postal-service and the postal-community than the much discussed-diversion of transactional-mail to electronic-bill paying . prior to 1970 , postage-rates were set by the congress . rates , generally , did not cover the costs of providing-service , so congress appropriated-tax-dollars to make up the difference . the postal-reorganization act of 1970 changed all that . it replaced the post-office department with a new united states postal-service and charged it with operating in a more business-like-fashion . congress would no longer set postal-rates , but it wanted to ensure that the public had an opportunity to be heard before the postal-service changed rates or services . therefore , it simultaneously established a separate , independent postal-rate commission to provide an open process in which the public could participate in the development of postage-rates . myth number one : contrary to what you may have heard or read , although the prc was not among the 1968 recommendations of the kappel commission -- -appointed by the president to study the future of the post-office department -- -neither did it spring forth like a phoenix from the ashes in some secret-conference between house and senate legislators . permit me , if you will , to correct the record . the key-elements were there the entire-time . i read from the conference-report on the 1970 act at page 84- the house bill contained…a postal-rate board as an independent-agency not part of the postal-service . the senate amendment contained…an independent postal-rate commission within the postal-service . the conference-substitute adopts the house provision ( for a freestanding-entity ) …changing the name to the ( senate proposed ) postal-rate commission… perhaps there is a lesson or two here for those who yearn for a new kappel-type presidential-commission as some sort of panacea to make recommendations to mold the future of the postal-service . commissions-study and recommend , the president proposes and the congress disposes -- -as it sees fit ! congress intended that mailers should be able to use the postal-rate commission 's proceedings to assure that some mailers were not crosssubsidizing other mailers and to assure that postage-rates reflected the costs actually incurred to provide service . further , by requiring the service to justify rate and service-changes , congress hoped to provide a check on inefficiency . each of you probably has your own point of view on how well the system works to keep the postal-service lean and efficient . but i hope you would agree that if mailers participate , and if the postal-service is subject to public-scrutiny , the result is likely to be better than if proposals go entirely unreviewed . a case in point can be found in the last omnibus-rate-case , the r97-1 case . • mailer participation in developing the public-evidentiary record was responsible in part for enabling the commission to shave some $ 750 million -- -almost one third -- -off of the service 's request for additional-revenue . as a result , almost-everyone received a smaller rate-increase than would have otherwise been the case . • another example : periodicals mailers , stung by sharply rising costs associated with the processing of their mail , insisted that postal-officials join them in an effort aimed at finding answers and ferreting intervenor told us on the record -- -a rocket-shot compared to most rate-type-proceedings . moreover , when the commission does attempt to shave some time off of the 10 months provided in the law , representatives of mailers both large and small-object . mailers want as much time as possible to examine the reams of data the postal-service provides in support of its proposals . with their money at stake , mailers prefer that things be done right rather than fast ! by the way , the original 1970 law contained no time-limit on rate-cases . the 10-month limit was added after one of the early-cases , overseen by an administrative-law-judge , recruited from another agency , seemed to go on forever . some think that we ought to go back in time , ought to get rid of the commission and replace it with not one but three administrative-law-judges to be borrowed from some other government-agency . bad-idea ! but do n't take my word for it . shakespeare wanted me to remind those who prefer a return to admin law-judges that `` what's past is prologue . '' and , santayana asked me to add that `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . '' i mentioned that the commission also has other responsibilities which impact the postal-community . these include : 1 ) approving both changes in existing-services and the establishment of new services -- -those are known as classification-cases ; 2 ) adjudicating complaints from anyone who believes the postal-service is not providing-rates or services as required by law ; 3 ) issuing advisory opinions when the postal-service proposes a substantially nationwide-change in the nature of its services ; and , 4 ) our mostly recently assigned task , providing congress with annual-reports about the costs and revenues of international-mail . finally , the commission is given 120 days to consider appeals from those who contend the postal-service has proposed closing their local-post-office without following the safeguard procedures congress wrote into law . this brings me to myth number three : the postal-service can not close a post-office without first obtaining the approval of the postal-rate commission , which supposedly takes four years . the facts are that the prc gets involved in only appeals of closings and then for only 120 days . that 's four months . not four years ! you ca n't get four years out of the equation even if you use washington fuzzy math ! and how many closings have been appealed ? according to a 1997 gao report only 296 of 2,614 closings were appealed over a 20-year period . i make that to be about 11 percent . and , what was the disposition of those appeals , you ask ? usps affirmed in 170 cases ; 31 cases dismissed ; and only 58 remanded on grounds that the usps had not complied with the procedural-requirements of the law . number of times the commission took more than 120 days to rule on an appeal , zero ! number of cases in which the usps was told by the postal-rate many years ago , when i was just starting my government career , one of my mentors gave me some advice , in the way of a quote purportedly from one petronius-arbiter in 210 b.c . actually , i 'm not opposed to change -- -to postal-reform . during my time at the commission , we 've made quite a few changes . we've issued rules to encourage experimentation by the postal-service and established-procedures for expedited-treatment of non-controversial cases . we 've established a website on which we post overnight every document filed with the commission , and we 've created a search engine that enables everyone to word-search these documents . want to find out how many times and in what context the aspect ratio of envelopes was mentioned in the current-rate-case ? how about in each and every case all the way back to 1971 ? try our website ! change is not the problem . the problem is -- -my concern is -- - that much of what has been on the table in the way of postal-reform over the past several years is tantamount to an uncontrolled and uncontrollable-experiment . maybe it is my training in the sciences coming to the fore , or maybe it 's my belief that the postal-service is too important to our economy and too intertwined in our everyday lives and livelihood to leave too much to chance . let me make clear at this point that i have a great deal of admiration for representative john mchugh and his staff . in the almost 17 years i spent on capitol hill i can not remember more than a handful of instances in which a member invested more of him or herself in an issue . and , although i took-issue with a number of provisions in his bill , i consider it unfortunate , that the chairman has run out of time in his search for the `` holy grail '' of postal-reform . it is unclear who , if anyone , will take up the challenge in the 107th congress . in the event that someone does take up the mchugh gauntlet and seeks your support , i think it is important that you , that mailers not just blindly endorse a bill simply because its title includes the phrase `` postal-reform . '' which rates would be lawful in this scenario ? the capped-rates that do not cover cost or the rates that exceed the cap but cover costs ? what 's a postal regulatory-commissioner to do ? more to the point , what 's a mailer really-likely to experience in the way of rate-increases ? by the way , it 's not altogether-clear that this price-cap-regime would achieve one of its other principle-objectives , that is , to put downward-pressure on future-cost-increases . why ? because the bill has an `` exigencies '' escape-clause and another provision that prohibits the prc from taking any action that might impact labor-negotiations . no , i 'm not suggesting that the last-provision i mentioned be drop from any future-bill . i do think , however , that some consideration should be given to a statutory-revenue-cap as one means of adding a bit of starch to the spine-cost-containment . without an effective-cost containment-program -- -and i have yet to see one -- -the postal-service , reformed or not , can not be what mailers want . it can not be a low-cost , efficient-provider of service . these examples are just a couple of the problems in the reform-bill that many in the community wanted to put on a fast-track through congress . everyone talks about how it has been 30 years since the postal-reorganization act was enacted ; that the postal-landscape is very different ; that now is time to change the law . again , i am not opposed to legislative-reform , but , if we are going to put our money on legislative-reform , we had better get it right , because once that next major postal-bill -- -a reform-bill -- -is enacted , it may be another 30 more years before we get a shot at fixing-things again . and , what would legislative-reform mean for the prc ? if something akin to h.r.22 were enacted , the commission would be neither strengthened norweakened . it would be different ! it would be relegated largely to after the fact-audits as opposed to its current pre-approved-role . and , it would grow to perhaps three or four times its current-complement of 55 bodies . now , while we are figuring out what should be done in the way of legislative-change , we -- -the postal-community , the postal-service and the postal-rate commission -- -should not just sit back and wait . there is much to explore ; much that can be done within the confines of current-law . we need to push the edges of the envelope -- -all them ! the ema is already working on a number of forward-thinking projects . as one of the world 's slowest and worst typists -- -i guess they call it keyboarding now -- -i especially like the idea of envelopes carrying-information i can scan into my computer to connect with a vendor 's website or with an information-source . let me throw out a few of my ideas for change that are not conditioned on congressional-action : • nsas , or negotiated service-agreements , have been a hot-topic in the legislative-equation . nsas are , for all intents and purposes , not very different from narrowly drawn classification proposals ; a number of which the commission has received and approved over the past few years . if the service has any such proposals on the drawing-board , it ought to send them over . if mailers have ideas , they ought to submit them . if someone thinks we need to modify our regulations to encourage niche-classification cases , let us know . nsas are doable under current-law ! why wait for legislation , if we can act now to drive costs out of the system and lower rates for qualified-mailers ? • -just before the r97 case was filed , when many in the community were concerned about the size of the service 's request , i suggested that a case calling for rates to be phased -- in over time might help avoid the rate-shock that comes with large , double-digit increases . this was not an entirely new idea . it was a take -- off on a joint usps-prc task-force-recommendation in the early '90s for a four-year-rate-cycle with a mid-cycle-adjustment . these proposals reflected the purported-desire of mailers for smaller and , implicitly , more frequent-rate-increases . we now seem to be in a two-year rate-case cycle . mailers are , however , understandably concerned over the cost of litigating these more frequent-cases . but by phasing in rates , they may be able to have their cake and eat it , too -- smaller periodic-increases and fewer cases to litigate . it is time , i believe , to dust off the task-force-recommendation and/or to give some serious-thought to the phased rate-approach . • -i mentioned our website a bit earlier . we 've been told that getting-documents posted overnight and providing a search engine has resulted in substantial-savings to intervenors and the postal-service . the commission can and should do more in this area . with a little-cooperation from the community , i think we can implement electronic-filing and service of documents . i 've already made several-suggestions in the package-services area : • when i spoke to the parcel shippers association in june of last year i suggested that , given the service 's economies of scale in delivery , alliances with other transportation or delivery-firms to carry their parcels the last-mile made sense -- -and would make dollars for the postal-service . this is happening already . • i 've also suggested that the service explore making low-weight parcel-post a wholesale , only , product and pushing low-weight over-the-counter-retail-parcels into priority mail . the price differential between priority mail and single-piece-parcels is very small . for just a couple of cents more , an individual can send a package-priority , and , if the individual-purchases-delivery confirmation , it becomes actually less expensive to use the faster priority mail-service ! faster service at a lower price-means satisfied-customers ! speaking of delivery-confirmation , it is currently-available for priority and parcel-post . the usps has proposed extending this service to standard mail . my thought here : why stop with standard ? there are roughly a quarter billion pieces of first -- class-mail for which individuals purchase the more expensive certified-mail option . delivery of a certified-mail piece is more costly to the postal-service than handling a delivery-confirmation-piece . certified-mail requires the carrier to make a special-trip to the door . if the carrier is already equipped with a scanner for delivery-confirmation-purposes , the service has an opportunity to avoid the time -- -and time is money -- -that it takes the carrier to make that special-trip to the door . delivery-confirmation provide more information quicker at less cost to both the postal-service and the customer ! as an old vaudevillian might say , `` i 've got a million of 'em '' -- -well , maybe not that many , but it is , i think , time to move on . i do want to assure you , though , that while i have been talking trees , i have not lost sight of the forest . last october there was a congressional-hearing at which the general-accounting-office presented unverified postal-service estimates of the impact of the diversion of first -- class-mail -- -bills and payments -- -to new technologies . the lead on the story was usps-volume to decline with a loss of $ 17 billion in revenue . at 33 cents a pop , i make that to be just short of 50 billion pieces of mail . and , the price of a stamp , according to the story , it would increase by 17 cents ! that is a pretty bleak-picture ! however , at the risk of being labeled a troglodyte , may i suggest that if you scratch the surface of that picture you might find that a few rays of sunshine still remain for hard-copy-mail . while i have no doubt there will be diversion , my uneducated-guess is that the glide-path will be longer and the incline not so steep . many believe that there will be gains to offset losses in transactional-mail-volume . for instance , bob wientzen of dma reported just a couple of weeks ago that high tech-ventures are generating new volumes of hard-copy-mail as what he called `` pure-play web companies '' launch-catalogues and direct-mail-campaigns to drive traffic to their web sites . maynard expressed similar-views in a news article this past-summer . moreover , unless the postal-service is incapable of shedding-volume variable-costs or waits until 2008 before adjusting first -- class rates , the price of a stamp does not have to go up by 17 cents . unless , it waits until 2008 to shore up its base , volume declines may not be so severe . what if i 'm wrong ? what if the worst case scenario does come to pass ? as i recall from the numbers in that july 20th atlanta journal-constitution-article , there goes much of that 8 percent of envelopes that currently carry bills and payments . that is not a pleasant-prospect , but it is a heck of a lot better than the prospect of losing a big-chunk of the remaining 92 percent of your business because an overreaching-law restricts the sharing of personal information and results in direct-marketing volumes going south . personal-privacy , one 's right to control the use of his or her personal information , is a hot-issue . it is a hard one to be against . and , it is a dangerous one to ignore , either as an individual or as a business-person . elements of the postal or mailing-community or whatever you might call it have been engaged in the privacy-issue at both the federal and state-levels . more often than not , those involved have been the businesses that would feel directly the impact of restrictions on the collection and sharing of person-data -- -the list-companies , the direct-marketers . think about this : if the direct-marketers and list-companies are forced to cut back because of data-restrictions , wo n't that impact the manufacture of goods that are marketed ? might it result in printers printing fewer catalogues ? wo n't it impact the envelope manufactures ? and , could it not result in a decline in postal-service volumes across -- the -- board ? those members of the greater mailer-postal-community who have not been paying-attention to the privacy-issue must do so . they must join with others in a broad-based-coalition that ignores differences they may have on traditional postal-issues . if there is less information and less prospecting , there will be fewer sales . fewer sales means fewer parcels to deliver , whether by white-trucks with an eagle or big , brown-trucks . the community needs , as a whole , i believe , to be proactive in pursuing of a rational , nation-wide-approach that addresses both the concerns , the rights of individuals and the needs of the business-community . i cut my teeth on information-policy and personal-privacy-issues about 25 years ago , as project-manager at the then department of health , education and welfare i worked directly on implementation of the federal-records privacy act of 1974 and the 1974 school records-access-law . i support the cornerstone-concept of these laws , known as fair-information-practices . and , i submit that the federal-privacy-law , governs the collection and use of personal-data by federal-agencies and which provides agencies a modicum of flexibility , is a reasonable-point of departure for future discussions of either industry-selfregulation or legislation . i had best stop at this point , since i 've taken more time and spouted off more than i should have . but let me leave you with a thought to keep in mind , in the event you are asked to evaluate my presentation . this fellow is flying a hot-air-balloon and suddenly realizes he is lost . he cuts back on the hot-air , descends and yells to a man he spots on the ground . `` excuse me , can you tell me where i am ? '' `` sure , '' the man yells back , `` you 're in a hot-air-balloon about 30 feet above this field . '' 'the balloonist yells back , `` you must work in information technology . '' `` i do , '' replies the man , `` but how did you know ? '' `` well , '' shouts the balloonist , `` everything you told me was technically-correct , but it 's of no use to anyone . '' the man on the ground thinks for a moment and yells back , `` you must work in management . '' `` why , yes , i do , '' replies the balloonist proudly , `` but how did you know ? '' `` well , '' says the man on the ground , `` you do n't know where you are or where you are going , but you expect me to be able to help . you 're in the same position you were in before we met , but now it's my fault ! '' thank you for having me here this morning .
