new funding-sources sought for foundation-president asks businesses to donate by mike fimea arizona business gazette jan. 31 , 2002 mark rubin thinks the arizona bar-foundation should look beyond the law-office for financial support . `` we hear from a lot of people who do n't believe the government should provide legal-services , '' said rubin , who began his one-year term as foundation-president in january . `` i want to challenge them to see what they can provide . the business-community could deliver funds and help with real-needs . the people who use legal-services are good-people who are just down on their luck . '' the bar-foundation funds legal-aid for the poor and educational-programs at schools . its budget comes from lawyer-contributions , grants and interest from lawyers ' trust-accounts , for 2002 , the foundation awarded nearly $ 950,000 to 11 agencies ( see sidebar ) . rubin , a sole-practitioner in tucson , says the foundation has '' quietly done a fabulous-job '' at legal-services and civics instruction . where it 's fallen short is in getting its message across . `` we have n't been as good at communicating our story , '' he said . `` we provide services to students all over the state , and bosnia has sent delegations to arizona to learn how our justice-system works . you ca n't have a democracy without also having a place to resolve disputes . '' as he begins his term , rubin faces an altered-funding-landscape for the state 's three primary-legal-aid-agencies : community legal-services in phoenix , southern arizona legal-aid in tucson and dna-people 's legal-services in flagstaff . the arizona equal-justice campaign has secured a three-year , $ 1.4 million commitment through a campaign that asks arizona bar members to contribute the equivalent of two billable-hours annually . `` we 're friendly-competitors . i 've made my two-hour-pledge , '' rubin said . the difference is that besides the `` big three , '' the foundation also gives money to smaller agencies like catholic social-services and the southern arizona people 's law center . `` we also fund a program at the asu law-school where students help the homeless get reacquainted with the legal-aspects of society , '' rubin said . `` the students show them how to get a driver 's license or deal with income taxes , things that we take for granted . '' rubin has held nearly every position within the foundation - treasurer , secretary , president-elect - since joining its board of directors in 1996 . he has watched as the trust-account fund has swelled and contracted , depending on the pricing-whims of the state 's banks . in 2000 , for example , the foundation awarded $ 788,000 in grants - a drop of nearly $ 200,000 - because banks reduced the interest rates paid on lawyers ' trust-accounts . funding has returned to the pre-2000 level , for which rubin credits former-foundation president david gaona . `` david did a tremendous-job , '' rubin said . `` he 'd meet with the banks and after his meetings , the rates would go up . '' rubin does n't expect interest rates on the trust-accounts to suddenly increase - `` the highest rates-today are less than they were 10 years ago ; that 's the economy '' - but he said the foundation must continue to advocate its cause . `` the funds we get from banks reflect a decision to part with money that they could use for other purposes , '' he said . `` we have to make the case that our mission is important to them . '' besides his legal-career , rubin is the founder of an online bookstore ( lawyerbriefs.com ) that reviews law-based-novels . the site-lists about 600 titles from the past 20 years , with reviews of about one-third of the books . john lescroart and william lashner are among rubin 's favorite writers ; he is less enamored of john grisham . `` my purpose is to see if these authors stay reasonably-true to the law and do n't get too fanciful , '' he said . `` it 's a hobby that does n't get too much time these days . '' when he looks back a year from now , rubin said he hopes the foundation has new programs , a higher profile and a rejuvenated board . `` i want to leave knowing i started us on the road to bigger and better things , '' he said .
