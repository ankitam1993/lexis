abuse-penalties questioned fines the same for beating a dog in county by maria herne tuesday , december 17 , 2002 if you beat a dog in schuylkill county , you 'll probably get a $ 100 fine . if you repeatedly beat a woman , you 'll probably get the same fine . in 2001 , county-judges heard 98 protection from abuse-cases , finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases , either after a hearing or through a technical-violation or plea . of those found guilty , the majority were ordered to pay court-costs , plus a $ 100 fine . no defendants were ordered to pay more than a $ 250 fine for violating the court order . in 27 percent of the cases , the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty . in the rest of the cases , charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved . sarah t. casey , executive director of schuylkill women in crisis , finds it disturbing that in most cases , the fine for violating a pfa is little more than the fine-someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal . `` in most of the counties surrounding schuylkill county , the penalties given for indirect criminal-contempt are much stiffer than those in schuylkill county , '' casey said . `` what kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate protection from abuse orders ? that it 's ok to abuse women in schuylkill county , because you 'll only get a slap on the wrist ? '' under state-law , the minimum-fine for contempt of a pfa is $ 100 ; the maximum-fine is $ 1,000 and up to six months in jail . like others who are familiar with how the county 's legal-system does and does n't work for victims of domestic-violence , casey believes some changes are in order . valerie west , a manager/attorney with mid-penn legal-services , with offices in pottsville and reading , regularly handles domestic-violence-cases . she finds fault with the local-requirement that a custody-order must be established within 30 days after a pfa is filed . west said she feels a custody-order should be allowed to stand for the full-term of the pfa - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state . `` it places an undue-burden on the plaintiff , in terms of cost , finding legal-representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services , '' west said . `` it may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred . it's counter-productive . '' the lack of supervised-custody-visitation in the county - a neutral , safe , supervised-place where children can be exchanged from one parent to another for the purposes of visitation - is also a concern . `` right now we do n't have any agency in the county willing to handle supervised-custody-visits , '' west said . `` obviously , in domestic-violence-cases this is a major-concern to us . there 's a potential for further incidents of abuse to occur during these meetings without some sort of outside-supervision . '' marsha-chwastiak , an attorney in the pottsville-office of mid-penn legal-services , said she would like to see more funds made available to provide social-services for troubled-families grappling with domestic-violence-issues . `` if i had one wish for christmas , it would be to have more resources available to help these families so they can try and sort out their problems , '' chwastiak said . `` in the majority of domestic-violence-cases i see , alcohol , drug and mental-health-problems are at the heart of the problem . i feel these are more social-problems than legal-cases , '' she said . other problems targeted by swic include a need for more expedient-service of pfas ; the need for free or affordable legal-representation and assistance with pfa and contempt-hearings and other civil-matters related to abuse , including-custody and support ; and the lack of proper-training by law enforcement-officials in handling domestic-violence-cases , casey said . a recent $ 202,297 federal-grant from the u.s. department of justice violence against women office may be the answer to some of these problems . through the collaborative-efforts of schuylkill women in crisis , the schuylkill county sheriff 's department and county-grant-writer lorraine a. bennick , the pathways to safety-program was initiated . the two-year-program is fully funded under the justice department 's `` grants to encourage arrest-policies and enforcement of protection-orders '' initiative . some of the ways the funds will be spent include : $ 90,000 to hire a civil-justice-attorney , at $ 45,000 a year for two years , to ensure that all victims of domestic-violence are represented at second hearings in pfas and assisted with other civil-matters . $ 20,171 to support overtime-costs of two additional-officers to serve pfas during nonscheduled-work-hours , ensuring more expedient and immediate-delivery and service of pfa orders . $ 3,645 to develop a domestic-violence training-program for local-police departments , led by a victim 's advocacy-trainer ; the goal of these mini-workshops will be to ensure that local-police departments consistently adhere to proper pfa protocol . $ 15,000 to hire a consultant to provide a complete , detailed study of establishing the most cost effective-link between county facilities and municipal-police-departments and to establish jnet , an information-management-system funded by the state of pa and operated by the pennsylvania justice-network . jnet was launched in 1998 by the ridge-schweiker administration to help local and state-police , courts , prisons and probation and parole-officers exchange instantly updated information on individuals moving through the criminal-justice-system - making it possible to better track potentially dangerous-individuals . by helping-justice-agencies share criminal-files more easily , jnet improves efficiency and reduces potential-errors that could occur from each agency maintaining disparate-data-files . jnet is also used to prevent the detention of individuals wrongly identified as criminal-suspects . `` the pathways to safety-program will compliment existing swic programs and address-problems experienced by victims of domestic-violence , '' casey said . `` we believe that victims of domestic-violence deserve immediate , consistent , respectful-treatment and that offenders receive swift , efficient , just punishment .
