california bar journal few who need legal-help get it december , 2002 california lags far behind comparable-states in funding legal-services for the poor , a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal-needs of the state 's poor and lowerincome-residents are being addressed . that figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice-system , according to a new study by the california commission on access to justice , which also found that despite increased spending , the gap between need and services remains substantial . `` as a practical-matter , in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal-assistance , '' said jack londen , past commission-chair and a partner with morrison & foerster in san francisco . `` whether we like it or not , sometimes landlords illegally-evict tenants , children with disabilities are denied proper-care , veterans do n't get services guaranteed to them , and elderly-people need legal-assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver . '' california has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million , including nearly one in five children . half the nation 's increase in poverty in the 1990s , when the number of poor jumped 30 percent , occurred in california , and nearly 25 percent of the nation 's poverty-increase occurred in los angeles county alone . even those with jobs are suffering : 26 percent of california workers earn poverty-level-wages . the commission 's report , `` the path to equal-justice : a five-year status-report on access to justice in california , '' examined how the legal-needs of the state's poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice-system and the improvements during that period . despite increases in state-funding to meet the legal-needs of the poor , low-interest-rates ( which have reduced the iolta fund ) , high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains . states like minnesota and new jersey spend three times more than california to meet the poor 's legal-needs , connecticut and massachusetts spend more than twice as much , and countries like england , canada , australia , scotland and new zealand spend anywhere from two to 14 times more proportionately than california , despite the fact that california has the world 's sixth largest economy . the report says the state would need to triple its combined public and private-investment in legal-services to adequately meet the legal-needs of low-income californians . the 1996 welfare-reform legisla tion , in particular , brought dramatic-changes to the lives of those living in poverty , for while fewer people now receive welfare-benefits , those who left-welfare to work are still poor . and the legal-issues they face `` have become more numerous and complex , '' the report said . `` parents who found only low-paying-jobs without health-benefits did not improve the well-being of their children . women who entered the workforce in low-skilled-positions with no opportunity to acquire marketable-skills lack realistic-long-term-options . obstacles to employment such as lack of child-care and transportation , domestic-violence and job-discrimination raise a host of new legal-issues . '' those issues revolve around an extensive-universe of problems , including-housing , education , domestic-violence , immigration , employment , grandparent-guardianships , bankruptcy and consumer debt , veterans ' issues , elder abuse and home-equity-fraud , the report said . to meet all those needs , there is only one legal-aid-lawyer for every 10,000 poor-californians . despite this bleak-picture , the state 's civil-justice-community has taken significant-steps to close the gap between need and services in the past five years : the legislature and the governor established the equal-access fund , which has provided $ 10 million annually since 1999 for more than 100 local legal-services-programs . access to the courts has been enhanced through a variety of self-help-options , including online-assistance in every county , a system of family-law-facilitators , increased-funding for alternative-dispute-resolution and simplified forms and procedures . the judicial council is addressing-language-barriers by increasing the availability of qualified-interpreters and translating-forms and instructions into spanish , vietnam-ese , korean and chinese . legal-services-programs have been strengthened by offering a wide-range of services , including self-help-clinics and hotlines and working-relationships with social-services-agencies to meet all of a client 's needs . still , when more than 70 percent of the poor 's legal-needs are not being met , much remains to be done , the report points out . it recommends adding to the access-fund , increasing both the number of pro-bono hours and financial-contributions from attorneys , improved assistance for unrepresented-litigants and access to an attorney for those who require one , and development of a statewide-plan to distribute legal-services more evenly throughout the state to insure that the rural-population also is served . `` i know my fe llow-judges want to do justice and not inflict injustice , '' observed justice earl johnson of the california court of appeal , who chaired the committee that researched and wrote the report . `` more than anyone , they know it can be nearly-impossible to do the former and avoid the latter in a one-sided-contest where only one litigant has a lawyer . '' `` our whole-society is harmed when access and fairness are denied , '' said londen . `` clearly , california can - and must - do better . ''
