cq weekly fy 04 budget-outlook ; legal-services corporation saturday , february 8 , 2003 the legal-services corp. ( lsc ) , a quasi-governmental-agency that provides legal-aid for the poor , would receive $ 329 million in fiscal 2004 under president bush 's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001 . if approved , the hold-the-line-request for lsc means its budget would erode with inflation for another year , but it could be worse for the organization : many conservatives fought for years to do away with the lsc altogether , saying legal-services-attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal-causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy . opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996 , when congress approved-restrictions ( pl 104-134 ) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal-aid-attorneys can take . ( 1996 almanac , p. 5-36 ) republicans cut the organization 's budget deeply in 1996 , but its funding has recovered slowly . last month , in the omnibus spending-bill for fiscal 2003 , the senate added a onetime-increase of $ 19 million , which , if approved in the final-version , would bring the lsc budget to $ 348 million . the money would go to help states , such as michigan and ohio , that lost-money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census-counts made in 2000 of poor-households . if the extra-money survives a conference with the house and makes it to the president 's desk , lsc supporters may try to include it in the organization 's fiscal 2004 funding . the federal government began funding some programs to provide legal-assistance to the poor in the late-1960s ; the legal-services corporation was created in 1974 ( pl 93-355 ) . lsc gives nearly all its money to state and local-agencies , which provide civil legal-assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal-poverty-level - $ 11,075 a year for an individual and $ 22,625 for a family of four . funding for legal-services goes to defend needy-clients in domestic-violence-cases , custody-cases and other such matters , according to lsc . since 1996 , lawyers who receive money from legal-services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying-legislatures , filing-class-action-suits , participating in political demonstrations or strikes , pursuing abortion-related-litigation , representing illegal-aliens or prisoners , or defending-public housing-tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs
