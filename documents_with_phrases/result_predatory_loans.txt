lawmakers-eye 'predatory ' loans lending-practices still face scrutiny by david olinger denver post staff writer sunday , march 17 , 2002 eileen ledford says she learned too late that her new home-loan was based on a lie . the mortgage-broker put her age at 67 . and he claimed she earned $ 11,000 a month - or $ 132,000 a year - from a home-quilting business she had owned for 22 years . `` i 'm 81 , '' she said , adding that she never owned a quilting company , never worked for one and never told a loan-agent she did . `` i do n't even know how to quilt . '' what the imaginary-quilting-business did produce was a loan that she and her husband , linn , who is 86 and suffers from congestive heart-failure , can not possibly afford . three times they have signed with high-interest lenders that refinanced their denver home , gave them some cash and escalated their debts . the latest is fieldstone-mortgage co. , which is charging them $ 3,290 a month - $ 859 more than their combined monthly-retirement-income . last month they could n't make the payment on a house they have owned for 31 years . ryan reilly , the broker who admits putting the nonexistent quilting-business on the loan-application , shared $ 15,600 in commis- sions with a company that referred the ledfords to him a year ago . he said he was just trying to help them get the money they needed for credit-card-bills and home-improvements . but in hindsight , `` i really wish i 'd never done the loan , '' he told the denver post . `` it did n't really help them in the long run . '' at the state capitol this week , colorado legislators will debate what to do about such loans . the senate is expected to vote on a bill sponsored by sen. doug linkhart to combat `` abusive home-loan practices . '' it would limit loan-fees and ban several `` predatory '' practices such as prepayment penalties and balloon payments on high-cost-home-loans . linkhart , a denver democrat , introduced the bill at the behest of aarp , acorn and other consumer-groups . he expects it to pass the senate but foresees trouble in the republican-controlled house . lining up against his bill are lenders and brokers who contend it would undermine an already weakened housing market and deny home loans to people with shaky-credit . the colorado association of mortgage brokers , for one , is campaigning instead to license brokers and create a mortgage-board where homeowners could take complaints . but its proposal faces opposition from the colorado mortgage lenders association , which argues that brokers should not shoulder new regulations and higher costs just because a few people are writing bad-loans . in the house , rep. rosemary marshall , d-denver , is preparing a predatory-lending-bill with fewer restrictions than linkhart proposed . while she supports his bill , `` my objective is to get something done this year , '' she said . the inspiration for this flurry of proposals is the fast-growing , aggressively marketed subprime-lending-industry . the federal government now tracks 188 companies specializing in subprime-loans that broaden access to home-mortgages , but at a price that typically includes higher interest rates and fees , and other costly-requirements . elderly and minority-homeowners hold a disproportionate-share of these higher-cost-loans . `` no good-resource ' for help using federal home-loan data , the post reported last year that black-homeowners in denver were 31/2 times as likely as white-homeowners to borrow from subprime-lenders , and hispanics 21/2 times as likely . the data also showed that black-homeowners earning more than $ 70,000 a year were more likely to get subprime-loans than white-homeowners earning less than $ 30,000 a year , a pattern that reflected national-trends . when a high-cost-loan appears destined to drive the borrower to default , advocates for colorado homeowners say there are few places to turn for help . hans fedge , a mortgage-broker assisting linn and eileen ledford , said he faces the same dilemma again and again . by the time homeowners seek help , they have lost much of their equity . they have no money for a lawyer . and state-law enforcement agencies focus on patterns of fraudulent-behavior , not problems with individual-loans . `` there is really no good-resource for the victims to get assisted right now , '' fedge said . linn ledford ran a denver wholesale-showroom and lived with his wife in a modest-house that originally cost $ 19,500 . thirty-one years later , their old neighborhood is being replaced by sandstone-hued-luxury-homes encircling the cherry creek shopping district . the ledfords expanded and refinanced their house over time , once to accommodate a grand-piano that linn played . but the series of subprime-loans that took them down what he calls `` the slippery slope '' date to 1998 , when he was 82 . he blames himself for their predicament , including the fieldstone-mortgage loan he persuaded his wife to sign with her good-credit . `` it 's just my stupidity and lack of understanding what could happen , '' he said . `` i had no idea . '' when fedge examined the ledfords ' recent mortgage loan history , this is what he saw : they refinanced in august 1998 with advanta , a subprime-lender that charged 10-percent-interest . that loan raised their payments to $ 2,051 a month , or 84 percent of their current monthly-income . in october 1999 they refinanced again with new century mortgage , another subprime-lender . that lowered their interest rate to 9 percent . but their principal-balance jumped $ 43,000 to $ 260,000 , and their mortgage payments grew by $ 30 a month . in december 2000 , they refinanced with fieldstone , getting almost $ 70,000 for credit-card-debts , home-improvements and the growing-gap between their expenses and income . the new loan raised their mortgage-debt $ 100,000 , to $ 360,000 . its costs included $ 15,600 in broker-commissions and a $ 9,234 prepayment-penalty to terminate the new century loan . their interest rate climbed to 10.5 percent , and could go as high as 16.5 percent . their mortgage payments immediately jumped $ 1,200 a month , to $ 3,290 . all based on a nonexistent-home quilting-business . a copy of the loan-application shows that ryan reilly listed eileen ledford as the 67-year-old owner of the american quilt . her supposed income : $ 11,000 a month . the ledfords ' actual-income : $ 2,431 a month from social-security and a small-annuity . fedge called the broker 's misstatements unconscionable . reilly does not deny putting-information on the application-form that he knew was incorrect . but he said he thought the ledfords understood they could qualify only if he put down a `` stated income , '' typically an undocumented-business-income that raises the borrower 's interest rate . `` i told them , `` you guys do n't make enough-money , ' `` he said . reilly also said he thought-mortgage-brokers commonly exaggerate business-proceeds in stated-income-loans - `` i would say 90 percent of the time they are padded '' - adding that he was 25 and inexperienced at the time and has not repeated the mistake since . `` i 'm trying to get away from the mortgage-industry '' in colorado , he said . `` there 's so much-conflict in it , and there 's not many regulations . '' couple felt uninformed the ledfords say they came away from a hurried-loan-closing without understanding how much their mortgage payments would increase or how reilly had qualified them to borrow $ 360,000 . they say they did n't know the application described eileen as a quilting-company-owner until fedge pointed it out . `` that , i did not see when i signed the papers , '' she said . `` i would have said , '' whoa ! ' right away . '' their new loan has forced them to put their home up for sale . if they sell it , they face another prepayment-penalty of almost $ 15,000 to fieldstone-mortgage . fedge and jose vasquez , a colorado legal-services-lawyer , assert that fieldstone bears some responsibility for approving a loan based on a suspiciously lucrative-income from an elderly-woman selling-quilts from her house . they asked-fieldstone to trade a deed to the house for $ 60,000 , enough-cash to let the ledfords buy a condo . `` i know that fieldstone is interested in finding a workable resolution , '' said adam bass , a lawyer for the company , adding that he ca n't comment on the details of the ledford-loan . meanwhile , the phone-calls persist from solicitors hoping to refinance the ledfords ' home again . `` we get at least a dozen calls every other day , '' eileen ledford said . `` it feels like hundreds .
