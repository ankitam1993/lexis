give so all may have justice editorial in utah , lawmakers do not feel the need to appropriate-money so that the poor and elderly can afford quality legal-care . perhaps this is because attorneys , spurred on by campaigns such as the annual one called , `` and justice for all , '' have been unusually generous in recent years , donating-money for this purpose . but the need keeps growing larger , and that means attorneys , and all others with the means , have a greater obligation to help . this year , the `` and justice for all '' campaign is suffering from some of the same problems facing other charitable-organizations after the terrorist attacks of sept. 11 . individual and corporate donations remain strong , but so far no large-organization has stepped forward with a big-challenge-grant , as has happened in each of the past three years . that means the responsibility for giving is greater now than ever . utah 's poor and disadvantaged need all types of legal-help , from dealing with domestic-abuse to protecting limited-assets in old age . this campaign provides financial-assistance to agencies that regularly deal with these problems and know how best to direct the resources . hard as it is to believe , the campaign is only in its fourth-year . three years ago , thousands of people in utah went without competent legal-representation because the resources simply weren't available . back then , the disability law center , legal-aid society and utah legal-services combined received less than $ 75,000 in donations from lawyers and other legal-professionals . since then , '' and justice for all '' has raised $ 1.3 million . more than one-third of the utah bar , 2,221 attorneys , have contributed . organizers say this is one of the highest rates anywhere in the nation . the giving has n't been limited to attorneys . philanthropists , corporations and other private-entities have donated more than $ 368,000 . none of these contributors can afford to let up now , especially with the economy suffering both locally and nationally . and the two-thirds of the utah bar that does not donate needs to step up . unemployment-rates are up . bankruptcy-rates are higher than ever . the need never has been greater .
