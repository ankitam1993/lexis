( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 section 603 : initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis the proposed-rulemaking , 60 fed . reg . 20590 ( april 26 , 1995 ) , incorporated an initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis of the expected-impact on small-entities . the analysis included in the proposed-rulemaking provides the information required by paragraphs 603 ( b ) ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) . it describes the reasons for the proposed agency-action , and its objectives and legal-basis . it also describes the total number of entities of all sizes that may be affected by the rule . ( see below . ) the analysis also requests-comments regarding the reporting and record-keeping-requirements of the proposed-rule . in accordance with paragraph 603 ( b ) ( 5 ) , the commission notes that the proposed-rule does not duplicate , overlap or conflict with any relevant federal-rule . also , it states that the proposed-rule has been designed to minimize the impact on small-entities while retaining the benefits of encouraging television broadcast programming that satisfies the requirements of the children 's television act of 1990 . section 604 : final regulatory-flexibility-analysis the preamble to the final-rule includes the full-text of the final regulatory-flexibility-analysis . 61 fed . reg . 43992 . the analysis includes the information required by paragraph 604 ( a ) by summarizing and evaluating relevant-comments received . a major-portion of the analysis describes the steps the commission took in attempting to determine the number of small-entities affected by the rule based on gao/ogc-96-37 various-criteria , databases and census-bureau information . this was necessary because of the inadequacy of the small business-administration 's definition for television-broadcasting-stations , the annual receipt-data collected by the commission , and the classification of stations with network-affiliation . under various-analyses , the worst case scenario would be the application of the rule to a low of 771 commercial-stations ( 68 percent of all stations ) to a high of 1,155 commercial and noncommercial-stations ( 78 percent of all stations ) . the commission believes that these estimates greatly overstate the number of small-entities affected and reserves the right to adopt a more suitable-definition of '' small business '' as applied to television-broadcast-stations at a later-date following the conclusion of several pending-proceedings at the commission seeking-comment on the definition of and data relating to small businesses and compliance with section 601 ( 3 ) of the regulatory-flexibility-act . the final-analysis discusses the comments received and the alternatives considered and the steps taken to minimize the impact on small-entities . it appears that many of these changes will also reduce the burden on non-small-entities . these steps include the deletion of the requirement in the notice of proposed-rulemaking that a broadcast-station utilize an icon for the identification of core-programming . the method of identification is now at the discretion of the stations . the commission also rejected a proposal that stations consult with educational-experts in order for a program to qualify as core-programming . finally , the commission will issue a standardized reporting-form for the quarterly-children 's programming-report to ease the information-collection-burden on small-entities . the final-analysis was forwarded to the chief-counsel for advocacy of the small business-administration . section 605 : avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis the commission did not invoke any of the exemptions or special procedures authorized by section 605 in preparing its regulatory-flexibility-analysis . section 607 : preparation of analysis the commission 's analysis used both quantifiable and general-descriptions of the effects of the rule on small-entities . section 609 : participation by small-entities in addition to the actions required by 5 u.s.c . § 553 , the commission also made available a complete-copy of the proposed and final-rulemaking-materials via the internet . page 2 gao/ogc-96-37 ( iii ) agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 as an independent regulatory-agency , the commission is not subject to title ii of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 .
