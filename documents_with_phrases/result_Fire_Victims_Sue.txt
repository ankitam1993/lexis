kalamazoo gazette alamo fire victims sue landlord by craig mccool thursday , august 8 , 2002 nine families displaced by a fire at alamo hills apartments in march filed-lawsuits wednesday against the apartment-complex . they allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze . bernard dempsey jr. , an attorney with western michigan legal-services , the group that represents the tenants , said alamo hills gave the displaced-families very limited-opportunity to remove belongings . `` they were given three days to get their stuff out , and if they could n't get moved out in three days , their stuff was discarded , '' dempsey said . `` alamo hills just threw it out . '' others , he said , lost-possessions to looters after the march 23 blaze , which left 78 people temporarily-homeless . according to the lawsuit , the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security . a spokesperson for pm one , the company that manages alamo hills , could not be reached for comment . nine separate-suits were filed in 8th district-court , which handles civil-claims of less than $ 25,000 . `` we 're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- $ 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket-expenses for their lost stuff , '' dempsey said . `` they 're not looking to get rich off this . a lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly . '' dempsey said most of the tenants who filed-suits still live at the apartment-complex , although many are trying to find homes elsewhere . `` the new apartments ( they were provided ) were not in very good shape . that 's actually one of the claims , '' he said .
