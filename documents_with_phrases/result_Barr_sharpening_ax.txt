atlanta journal-constitution barr sharpening ax on legal-aid to poor melanie eversley - cox washington bureau saturday , march 23 , 2002 washington -- - the organization that pays for legal-representation for the poor could be in trouble . bob barr , the conservative republican-congressman from georgia , is asking questions about the legal-services corp. barr thinks the private , washington-based-non-profit organization , which pays local-groups to represent the poor , is not doing business the way it should . he has asked the general-accounting-office to conduct a probe . `` we want to know why there 's no peer-accounting-system , why there 's no real-method of competition for grants , and why meetings are held in secret , '' barr said . the congressman heads the house judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative-law , which oversees the legal-services corporation . legal-services is funded by congress through an annual-appropriation : $ 329.3 million for fiscal 2002 . in georgia , the organization-channels-funds to the georgia legal-services-program and the atlanta legal-aid society . since 1994 , when republicans took over as the majority-party in the congress , gop members have charged that the lsc takes part in political-activities . edwin meese , attorney-general under president reagan , is among critics who have pointed out that congress demanded in 1996 that the organization not do so . lsc president john erlenborn recently testified to congress that the organization had instituted an oversight-system run by 12 lawyers and other employees to ensure that its programs do not violate the rule . `` lsc has made every effort to ensure that the congressional-restrictions placed on grantees are strictly-observed , '' erlenborn said . `` we pledge to continue working with this committee to improve the civil-justice delivery-system in america , '' he said , `` and to ensure federal-dollars allocated for legal-services are being spent in the most efficient and cost-effective-manner possible . '' erlenborn said that congress had stipulated that lsc-funded-programs are forbidden from filing or litigating-class-action lawsuits , engaging in lobbying , litigating on behalf of prisoners , or representing most undocumented-immigrants . critics say that the lsc-funded-organizations tend to defend people involved in leftist-causes . `` unfortunately , the legal-services corp. that 's in existence now is dedicated to political-activism and leftist-causes , and , sometimes , the representation of the poor , '' said todd gaziano , senior-fellow in legal-studies at the washington-based heritage foundation . gaziano is working with meese in opposing the lsc . `` the representation of the poor is kind of low down on their list of priorities , '' gaziano said . `` the current clinton-appointed-board has thumbed its nose at congressional-attempts to focus the legal-services corp. on its mission of helping indigent-litigants in certain-types of proceedings . '' a house democratic-staffer close to the case said that gao studies in the past have proved that lsc is complying fully with the congressional-stipulations . the legal-services corp. came about in 1974 under president richard nixon . it is run by an 11member board appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate . no more than six members of the bipartisan-board can be from any one political-party . president bush is expected to name new board members soon , and barr said he would like to have an effect on those appointments . he said this week that he had sent a letter to the white house spelling out his questions about the organization . `` i 'm not a fan of spending-taxpayer-dollars on the legal-services corp. , '' barr said . `` it could run on private-contributions and , if a state believes it ought to be involved , then through state-funds . '' but barr also said : `` i do n't think its realistic that we're going to be able to zero it out . therefore , we should at least make it operate within the bounds of the law . ''
