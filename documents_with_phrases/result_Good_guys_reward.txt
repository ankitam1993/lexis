good-guy 's reward working-class-people 's lawyer fred rooney will get prestigious-award tonight . by ron devlin november 1 , 2002 one look at fred rooney , and you just know he 's the good-guy . a trace of childish-innocence in his face gives the lanky bethlehem lawyer a jimmy stewart-like-quality of quiet-trust . in black-jeans and button-down-shirt , he 's a kind of folk-hero in the south bethlehem melting-pot where he 's crafted a law-practice catering to working-class-families - mostly latino - in the shadow of the hulkish-remnants of bethlehem steel . a two-hour-drive away , at city university of new york law-school in queens , rooney spends several days a week helping-upstart lawyers develop storefront-practices that , like his , provide legal-representation to folks who ca n't afford a $ 250-an-hour legal counselor . kristin booth glen , the law-school 's dean , took one look at rooney and knew he was the right-person to head the innovative community legal-resources network . ''fred 's so low-key , he 's midwestern in effect , '' says glen , a former new york supreme court judge . ''he captivates people , he inspires-loyalty . '' for bringing legal-representation to the poor and a host of other social-causes , including finding medical care for seriously ill-children in latin america , the moravian college alumni association has chosen rooney for its prestigious-haupert humanitarian award . the award , given to only a select few alumni , will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on moravian 's priscilla payne hurd campus . moravian , where he was an undergraduate in the early-1970s , inspired rooney 's deep-sense of social-justice . the son of a bethlehem steel executive in new york , he came to the bethlehem campus from an affluent-upbringing on long island . the young rooney might have set his sights on washington , d.c. , like his uncle , former u.s. rep. fred rooney of bethlehem . after all , politics run in the rooney family . his brother , state rep. t.j. rooney of bethlehem , is a power in the state-legislature and the democratic party . but on a trip to colombia when he was a junior at moravian , the child of privilege saw human-suffering , malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined . ''i could n't understand why we live this way and they live that way , '' rooney recalled . ''it 's been the guiding-light of my life ever since . '' after graduating in cuny law-school 's first class in 1986 , he took a job with lehigh valley legal-services . he loved the work , but his income was so low he met federal-poverty-guidelines that qualified him for his own low-income legal-services . while classmates were working for big new york law-firms , rooney was driving a wellworn chevy nova that had to be coaxed to start every morning . fluent in spanish , he set up a practice in bethlehem and attracted latinos clustered in the old neighborhoods off the lehigh university campus . ''fred was ahead of his time in addressing the needs of the latino community , '' said district justice michele varricchio of allentown , a former-law-partner . ''he sees everyone as being equal . '' key to rooney 's success , in addition to being bilingual , were his ''low bono '' rates . he did n't work free , known as pro-bono , but charged one-third the going-rate and took a client 's ability to pay into account when making up the bill . ''i did n't get the whole-fee , but i got something , '' rooney says . ''it helped pay the bills , and i was doing the right-thing . '' though he did n't fully realize it , rooney was pioneering a prototype community-service law-practice . at cuny , law-school-administrator sue bryant was thinking along the same lines . she envisioned a network of solo-practitioners , like rooney , serving ethnic-communities across the metropolitan-area . by providing-research-services , mentors and continuing-education - all the things they 'd have if they worked in big-law-firms - storefront lawyers could make a living charging affordable legal-rates , bryan theorized . the community legal-resources network ''helps lawyers become economically-viable so they can serve the poor and lower middle class , who often ca n't afford legal-representation , '' said dorothy zellner , the law-school 's spokeswoman . ''it 's a perfect-fit for the school 's motto : law in the service of human-needs . '' studies suggest 80 percent of the legal-needs of low-income americans go unmet . largely because of his experience in bethlehem , rooney was hired to run the community legal-resources network . over five years , using-grants from the open society institute and the ford foundation , the program has grown to 100 lawyers . the number is expected to double in the next year . nat hentoff , civil-liberties-columnist for the village voice , called the network a ''seminal force for justice , equal and practical . '' the american bar-association journal is planning an article , and a half-dozen other colleges are looking at duplicating rooney 's program . roberta chambers , who set up practice in queens village , is typical of the network 's members . fifteen years ago she came to new york from jamaica . she didn't have a green-card , but she did have a dream : to become a lawyer . she became a registered-nurse , but always held on to the idea that someday she would be a lawyer . she enrolled in cuny - the most diverse-law-school in the nation - and achieved her dream five years ago . now , with the network 's help , she runs a neighborhood-law practice in a converted-storefront . immigrants , social-workers and bus-drivers come to her for advice on divorce , child-custody and bankruptcy . ''i handle average-type-people stuff , '' said chambers , sitting in front of a wall of used law-books she picked up at auction . chambers charges $ 150 an hour , compared with the going new york rate of $ 250 for consultation and $ 500 for court-appearances . rarely is she paid the full-fee . ''many times i have a client who 's out of work and we negotiate a fee or work out a payment-plan , '' she says . ''i have people who swear by me . they always come back and bring others with them . '' the rooney system is working in queens , as it has in bethlehem . rooney 's vision and decades of hard-work have paid off for the 49-year-old . he has two law-partners , lori mannicci and linda gardner . they handle the day-to-day-operations , while rooney commutes to new york and does pro-bono-work for schools and community-organizations . ''my part in the firm is not to generate income , '' he said . ''a very large-percentage of what i do is pro-bono or low-bono . '' roberta chambers and the lawyers in the network , rooney predicts , will follow the same path . they , too , will get to the point where they are no longer-dependent solely on low-bono fees . he 's confident that they , like he , will always give generously of their legal-talent . ''the idea is to never completely get away from the communities that gave you your start , '' he said . ''when you 're blessed with good-fortune , you need to give something back . ''
