law-school-grads balking at low-pay-jobs enormous-college-loans behind legal-aid-snub tom mcghee wednesday , january 8 , 2003 law-school-graduates paying back $ 80,000 and more in college loans are reluctant to seek low-paying-jobs representing the poor , legal-experts say . students leaving-law-schools earn annual-salaries as low as $ 25,000 working for government-public-service-organizations , while those who land jobs with top-ranked-law-firms make $ 80,000 a year or more . some graduates who take jobs with colorado legal-services , which handles housing and other civil-disputes for the poor , pay up to $ 800 a month on student-loans , said jonathan asher , executive director . the agency pays newly graduated lawyers $ 31,736 a year in denver and $ 24,911 elsewhere in the state . top-firms in denver and elsewhere pay first-year-associates $ 80,000 to $ 125,000 a year . galloping-tuition-payments have reduced the pool of applicants for legal-aid and other public-service-jobs , asher said . nationally , law-school-tuition doubled between 1991 and 2001 , according to the national association for law placement , based in washington , d.c. 'a significant number of people have said that for them the pressure of student-loans eliminates their options and choices , ' asher said . sixty-six-percent of law-students surveyed nationally in 2002 said that debt kept them from considering a job with groups like colorado legal-services , said a study by the national association for law placement . and 68 percent of public-interest-employers reported-difficulty in recruiting-attorneys . in 2001 , median private-law school tuition was about $ 23,000 a year , according to the study . the average law-school graduate carries debt of more than $ 84,000 . that does n't include debt racked up on undergraduate work . it is a source of frustration , said libby deblasio , a university of denver law-student . 'it 's kind of a joke among a lot of us who want to do public-interest-law . we say , 'yeah , this is what i want to do , but i may have to work in a private-firm and be a drone for a while . '' jennifer knight , a lawyer with colorado legal-services who handles housing and other civil-cases for the poor , is paying off roughly $ 80,000 in loans . and she received a scholarship that paid half her tuition at northeastern university 's law-school in boston . knight , 31 , is a mexican-american who grew up in a low-income-housing development . when she was still in high school , she decided she wanted to be a lawyer and work with the poor . many of knight 's fellow minority law-students also were interested in public-service , she said . but most went into private-practice . 'a lot of people i went to law-school with were fired up about public-practice , but they had more debt than i did , ' she said . at the state 's largest law-school , the university of denver , tuition climbed from about $ 15,000 to $ 23,994 during the past 10 years . by comparison , tuition at the university of colorado law-school at boulder is much lower for state-residents - $ 6,754 a year . out- of-state-residents pay $ 21,252 . so far , asher said , colorado legal-services has been able to attract the talent it needs . the state public-defender 's office - where new lawyers make $ 43,536 a year - also continues to attract good-candidates , said frances smylie brown , chief-deputy . but in the last-several years , the office widened its search for potential-hires , reaching outside the state for the first time in its history . 'we do n't have a large enough-pool of applicants from denver university and the university of colorado to fill the number of openings we have each year , ' smylie brown said . du has a law- student-body of about 1,000 , and cu 's population is about half that . population-growth and a corresponding-increase in crime are primarily-responsible for the dwindling-number of local-candidates , but interest is also waning , smylie brown said .
