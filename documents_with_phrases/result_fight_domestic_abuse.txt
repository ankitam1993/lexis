jackson sun ( tn ) grant to help fight domestic-abuse by rachel myer tuesday , september 10 , 2002 a west tennessee nonprofit-organization will use a $ 300,000 federal-grant to hire an attorney and a spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal-assistance to domestic-violence-victims . the u.s. department of justice two-year-grant will begin oct. 1 , which is the start of domestic-violence awareness month . u.s. rep. john tanner announced monday that the grant was awarded to west tennessee legal-services of jackson . the organization provides legal-assistance and advocacy in 17 counties . `` this award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic-violence and help the women , men and children who are victims of abuse , '' tanner said in a news statement . the organization does n't have a staff-member who speaks spanish and the need is increasing with growing hispanic-populations , said the organization 's executive director steven xanthopoulos . he estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year . the group closes about 2,500 cases a year . the money was timed well because the legal-group had recently lost about $ 120,000 in grant-money due to a decrease in the poverty-population in west tennessee in census 2000 , xanthopoulos said . `` the drop in poverty is a good thing , but there is still a great need out there , '' he said . `` so this was a very good thing . '' having legal-representation at divorce and child-custody hearings is important in helping-victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous-situations , said margaret cole , executive director of wo/men 's resource and rape assistance-program in jackson . her organization and northwest safeline are partners in the grant . northwest safeline , based in dyersburg , is a family-violence intervention project that serves dyer , obion , lake and crockett-counties . the grant also will help victims go through court-proceedings after losing a job or being evicted because of an abuser 's actions , xanthopoulos said . `` it 's going to help the victims , but it 's also going to help their children , '' he said . more than 270 domestic-violence-assaults in madison county were reported last year , according to tennessee bureau of investigation statistics . in jackson , more than 730 domestic-violence-assaults were reported last year , according to records . `` domestic-violence is certainly on the increase and we need to do something to curve that . i see this as helping that , '' madison county sheriff david woolfork said of the grant . domestic-violence accounted for five of 12 murders in 2001 in jackson , police have said . and the increase in calls prompted jackson police chief rick staples in march to form a focus-group to determine if police officers need to make changes in their response to domestic-calls .
