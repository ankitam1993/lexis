( i ) cost-benefit-analysis an economic-impact-analysis is included with the regulatory-impact-analysis at 62 fed . reg . 25441 . because pork-production in sonora is a relatively new development and because the united states has restricted the importation of swine and pork-products for the last 20 years , aphis bases its potential-impact-analysis on some assumptions regarding the level of pork-production in sonora in the future , the percentage of pork-production that might be processed in sonora for shipment to the united states , and the demand for pork in the united states . aphis estimates that the importation of pork from sonora could cause u.s. pork-producers to lose from 5 to 10 cents per pound ( liveweight ) but could save consumers from 7 to 16 cents per pound ( retail-weight ) . aphis states that these estimates are dependent on both the amount of fresh-pork imported and on consumer-reaction to the mexican-pork products . gao/ogc-97-43 ( ii ) agency-actions relevant to the regulatory-flexibility-act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 603-605 , 607 and 609 on april 18 , 1996 , aphis published its initial regulatory-flexibility-analysis in the preamble to the proposed-rule ( 61 fed . reg . 16978 at 17017 ) . the analysis concluded that , because the rule relaxed the hog cholera-related-restrictions imposed on the importation of live-swine and prepared-pork-products from sonora , mexico , the proposed-rule could have a significant economic-impact on a substantial-number of small-entities in the united states . the initial-analysis invited-comments on the potential-impacts discussed . aphis stated that the precise-impacts of pork-product-imports were difficult to predict because of the uncertainty as to how they would substitute for domestic and/or foreign-pork-products . aphis points out that commercial-pork-production in sonora is relatively new and that the united states has imposed restrictions on the importation of swine and fresh-pork-products from mexico for over 20 years . the analysis does discuss , however , what aphis considers to be the anticipated-impact on the u.s. livestock-sector : the farrow-to-finish-swine-operators , the live-hog dealers/transporters , and the swine slaughterers/primary processors . on may 9 , 1997 , aphis published its final regulatory-flexibility-analysis ( 62 fed . reg . 25439 at 25441 ) . in that analysis , aphis discusses the reason for the final-rule and the legal-basis for it . it also describes and estimates the number of small-entities affected by the rule and discusses the recordkeeping , reporting , and other compliance-requirements . finally , it describes the alternatives considered in the development of the rule and why it rejected them and adopted the rule as proposed . the alternatives included ( 1 ) not lifting the current-importation-restrictions for the state of sonora and ( 2 ) allowing-importation under either less or more stringent-mitigating-conditions . aphis rejected the first alternative because it believed scientific-evidence permitted importation of pork-products from sonora and not permitting such importation would be contrary to trade-agreements entered into by the united states . aphis rejected the second alternative because it believed that less stringent-mitigating-measures than the ones proposed would increase the risk of the introduction of hog-cholera into the united states and that more stringent-mitigating-conditions would be unnecessarily-restrictive . agency-actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 , 2 u.s.c . §§ 1532-1535 according to aphis , this rule contains no federal-mandates ( under the regulatory-provisions of title ii of the unfunded-mandates reform act of 1995 ) that may result page 2 gao/ogc-97-43 in expenditures by state , local , and tribal-governments , in the aggregate , or to the private sector , of $ 100 million or more in any one year . ( iv ) other relevant-information or requirements under acts and executive-orders administrative procedure act , 5 u.s.c . §§ 551 et seq . the rule was issued as a notice of proposed-rulemaking on april 18 , 1996 ( 61 fed . reg . 16978 ) under the notice and comment procedures of 5 u.s.c . § 553 . initially , aphis allowed 90 days for comments , but in response to several-requests that the comment-period be extended , it allowed an additional 60-day comment-period . all comments were due by september 17 , 1996 . during the comment-period aphis also held four public-hearings at which both oral and written comments were received . in total , 113 comments were received from representatives of state and foreign-governments , international economic and political-organizations , veterinary associations , state-departments of agriculture , livestock and exporting and importing-industry-associations , and other interested parties . based on the number and complexity of the comments , aphis decided to issue only a small-portion of the proposed-rule at this time and to review and reanalyze the other portions of the rule before issuing them as final . paperwork reduction act , 44 u.s.c . §§ 3501-3520 according to aphis , the information-collection and recordkeeping-requirements included in this final-rule have been approved by the office of management and budget ( omb ) in accordance with the paperwork reduction act . the assigned omb control-number is 0579-0015 . statutory-authorization for the rule aphis cites as statutory-authorization for this rule 7 u.s.c . 147a , 150ee , 161 , 162 , and 450 ; 19 u.s.c . 1306 ; 21 u.s.c . 111 , 114a , 134a , 134f , 136 , and 136a ; 31 u.s.c . 9701 ; 42 u.s.c . 4331 and 4332 . executive-order no . 12866 the final-rule is considered to be an `` economically-significant regulatory-action '' under executive-order 12866 and was reviewed by omb for compliance with that order . national environmental policy act , 42 u.s.c . 4321 et seq . aphis performed an environmental-assessment and determined that the actions required or authorized by this rule will not present a significant-risk of introducing page 3 gao/ogc-97-43 or disseminating-hog-cholera disease agents into the united states and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human-environment . based on those findings , the administrator has determined that an environmental-impact-statement need not be prepared . executive-order 12988 according to aphis , this rule has been reviewed under executive-order 12988 ( civil-justice-reform ) and has been found to meet the standards set forth in the order . the final-rule preempts all state and local-laws and regulations that are inconsistent with the final-rule , has no retroactive-effect , and does not require administrative-proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule . page 4 gao/ogc-97-43
