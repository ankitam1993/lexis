we intially tried with wikipedia text but that had significnt number of unknowns 
Now we tried with 300 dimension common crawl data. Even this has unknown wordsbut the number is less , out of 80K hardly
4k words are unknown.

get embeddings of phrases -- average of individual word embeddings, for unknown words we have simple ignored the word embedding 

 clustering on top of these embeddings
 kmeans
 gaussian
 hierarchial
 
 analysing the phrase embeddings
 2 clusters for any data for any type of clustering
