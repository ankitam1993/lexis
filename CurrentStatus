Problems with NP phrases :
reason NP's phrases are bad, redundant noun phrases, named entities which are not relevant to theme of document
most of the times. (examples)

Phrases using semantria
          
          
Glove  for word embeddings:
we intially tried with wikipedia text but that had significnt number of unknowns 
Now we tried with 300 dimension common crawl data. Even this has unknown wordsbut the number is less , out of 80K hardly
1.2k words are unknown.

get embeddings of phrases -- average of individual word embeddings, for unknown words we have simply ignored the word embedding 

 clustering on top of these embeddings
 kmeans
 gaussian

Visualizing using TSNE :
 
 analysing the phrase embeddings
 2 clusters for any data for any type of clustering.
 Since 2 clustering models returned number of clusters as 2. So we concluded phrase embeddings are the reason for poor clustering.
 
 Approaches:
 After getting key phrases from semantria , use a similar model like word2vec in which phrases from semantria as treated as word
 cons - cannot learn embeddings for new phrases, to include new phrases we might need to retrain again.
